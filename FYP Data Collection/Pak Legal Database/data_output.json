        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners, tenants of a building named \"Abid Chamber,\" owned by the respondent, were involved in rent disputes initiated by the respondent. The landlord filed applications under Section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, for fixation of fair rent before the Rent Controller. The Rent Controller fixed the fair rent of the premises at Rs. 9 per square foot per month, which the petitioners contested through First Rent Appeals. These appeals were dismissed by the Appellate Court. Dissatisfied, the petitioners filed constitutional petitions in the High Court of Sindh, Karachi, which also dismissed their cases, upholding the decisions of the lower courts. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Rent Controller correctly applied the criteria under Section 8 of the Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979, for determining the fair rent of the premises. 2- Whether the evidence provided by the landlord was sufficient to justify the rent increase. 3- Whether the petitioners' claim that they had made lump sum payments (goodwill or \"pugri\") invalidates the rent calculation based on square footage. 4- Whether the courts below had misread or ignored relevant evidence or legal provisions in determining the fair rent. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court dismissed the petitions, agreeing with the findings of the lower courts. The Court held that the Rent Controller had appropriately applied the criteria under Section 8 of the Ordinance, considering factors such as increases in taxes, repair charges, and the prevailing rent in the locality. The landlord\u2019s representative provided unshaken and credible testimony regarding these factors, while the tenants failed to substantiate their claims, particularly the alleged goodwill payments. The Court found no illegality or misreading of evidence in the judgments of the lower courts. The petitioners' request to pay rent arrears in installments was deemed a matter to be negotiated with the landlord. -----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Ajmal Khan v. Lt.- Col.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner lodged an FIR on 12.04.2021 under section 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for the abduction of his 17-year-old brother, who had gone missing after attending Isha prayers on 21.03.2021. Initially, the complaint was against unknown persons, but in a supplementary statement on 14.11.2022, the petitioner accused two respondents of the abduction. The police conducted an investigation and declared the accused innocent, finding no evidence of their involvement. The petitioner, dissatisfied with the police\u2019s findings, filed a habeas corpus petition under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the recovery of his brother, who he believed was in the custody of the accused respondents. -----Issues: 1- Whether a habeas corpus petition is maintainable in the case of a missing person when there is no evidence of unlawful detention by the named respondents. 2- Can habeas corpus be invoked to locate a missing person who is untraceable but not proven to be held by the named respondents? -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the habeas corpus petition was not maintainable. Habeas corpus is a legal remedy intended to secure the release of a person unlawfully detained, but it cannot be used merely to locate a missing person when there is no evidence of unlawful detention. The court emphasized that the essential requirement for habeas corpus is a clear case or strong suspicion of illegal detention, which was not established in this case. The petitioner's submission of an additional written application naming two other suspects further undermined the claim that the named respondents were responsible for the detention. As the police investigation was ongoing and had not uncovered any leads, the court advised the petitioner to pursue other legal remedies. The court directed the police to continue their efforts to trace the missing individual. -----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Ajmal Khan v. Lt.-Col.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, challenged the judgments of the Civil Judge and Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, which dismissed his suit for declaration and permanent injunction regarding ownership of land measuring 04-Kanal 11-Marla. The petitioner claimed ownership through a registered sale deed from 1975, but the respondent (Province of Punjab) had canceled earlier mutations based on fraudulent claims of Faiz Muhammad, who had initially been allotted the land. The petitioner argued that the sale deed in his favor was valid and could not be canceled, especially after the repeal of the Evacuee Laws in 1975. -----Issues: 1- Whether the mutation in favor of Faiz Muhammad, from whom the petitioner derived his title, was valid or fraudulent. 2- Whether the Provincial Government had the authority to cancel the allotment and mutations made by the Central Government. 3- Whether the petitioner\u2019s claim could be upheld after the repeal of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958. 4- Whether the courts below erred in dismissing the petitioner\u2019s suit for declaration. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the original allotment to Faiz Muhammad was fraudulent, and the subsequent transactions based on that allotment were also void. Fraud vitiates even the most solemn proceedings, and any rights derived from fraudulent transactions are automatically invalid. The court emphasized that fraudulent transactions are subject to review and cancellation, even after the repeal of the Evacuee Laws in 1975. The court found that under Section 10 of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act, 1958, the Chief Settlement Commissioner had the authority to investigate fraudulent allotments and cancel such allotments if necessary. The fact that Faiz Muhammad\u2019s allotment was fraudulent meant that the Provincial Government acted within its authority to cancel it. The petitioner\u2019s claim that the transaction could not be reopened after the repeal of the Evacuee Laws was rejected. The court ruled that fraud does not fall under the protection of being a past and closed transaction, and fraudulent allotments can be reopened and investigated even after the repeal of the relevant laws. The court concluded that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate that the original allotment to Faiz Muhammad was genuine. As a result, the petitioner\u2019s claim to the land, based on subsequent transactions from Faiz Muhammad, could not be upheld. The court found no illegality or error in the decisions of the lower courts. The revision petition was dismissed, and the concurrent judgments of the Civil Judge and Additional District Judge were upheld. -----Citations/Precedents: Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners challenged a judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge, which had set aside the decision of the Civil Judge in their favor. The case concerns a dispute over the transfer of land measuring 11 kanals 17 marlas in Chakwal. The petitioners claimed that their father had executed a general power of attorney in favor of respondent No. 1 (his daughter), which was later revoked. However, respondent No. 1, despite knowing about the revocation, transferred the property to her husband (respondent No. 2). The petitioners alleged that this transfer was fraudulent and sought a declaration and cancellation of the mutation. ----Issues: 1- Whether the revocation of the general power of attorney was validly communicated to respondent No. 1. 2- Whether the mutation of the property based on the general power of attorney was lawful, especially after its revocation. 3- Whether the petitioners were justified in delaying their challenge to the mutation for more than eight years. 4- Whether the principles of waiver, estoppel, and acquiescence apply to bar the petitioners from challenging the mutation. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court found that the petitioners failed to prove that proper notice of revocation of the general power of attorney was given to respondent No. 1. Under the law, a principal must notify the agent before revoking a power of attorney. In this case, the petitioners did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that such notice was given. The mutation in favor of respondent No. 2 was executed based on the general power of attorney. The petitioners did not take any action to challenge the mutation for more than eight years, despite knowing about it. The court held that this delay in challenging the mutation was unjustified, and the petitioners' predecessor (their father) did not contest the mutation during his lifetime. The court also applied the principles of waiver, estoppel, and acquiescence. The petitioners' inaction for such a long period implied their acceptance of the mutation, and they could not challenge it after such a delay. The court acknowledged that, generally, an agent cannot transfer property to themselves or their relatives without the principal's permission. However, in this case, since the petitioners' father did not challenge the transaction during his lifetime, this argument was not sufficient to help the petitioners. The court found no illegality or jurisdictional defect in the appellate court's judgment, which was based on a correct appreciation of the evidence and applicable law. The revision petition was dismissed, and the appellate court's judgment was upheld. ----Citations/Precedents: Fida Muhammad v. Pir Muhammad Khan (PLD 1985 Supreme Court 341) Mst. Ghulam Fatima v.

The appellant sought to set aside a judgment and decree dated January 9, 1979, which had made an arbitration award the rule of the court. The arbitration involved a property dispute between the appellant\u2019s father, Muhammad Nawaz, and Respondent No. 3, who was declared the owner of the disputed property based on a gift from Muhammad Nawaz. The appellant challenged the judgment and decree under Section 12(2) of the Civil Procedure Code (C.P.C.), alleging fraud and misrepresentation, but his application was dismissed by the trial court and upheld by the appellate and revisional courts. --- Issues: 1) Whether the judgment and decree making the arbitration award the rule of the court were obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. ---2) Whether the arbitration agreement and award were validly executed. ---3) Whether Muhammad Nawaz, the appellant's father, appeared in court and consented to the award. ---4) Whether the lower courts erred in dismissing the application under Section 12(2), C.P.C. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming the findings of the lower courts. The court held that the appellant failed to prove that the judgment and decree were obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. The evidence presented, including the recorded statement and thumb impression of Muhammad Nawaz, supported the conclusion that he had consented to the award. The appellant's claims were based on hearsay, and no cogent evidence was provided to disprove Muhammad Nawaz's appearance in court or the validity of the arbitration agreement. The concurrent findings of fact were upheld, and the court found no grounds for interference, as no misreading or non-reading of evidence was established. ---- Citations/Precedents: Abdul Rasheed through L.Rs. and others v.

Barkat Ali v. Muhammad Ismail, 2002 SCMR 1938 ref. --- Background: This case involves an appeal against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, which overturned two concurrent judgments from the lower courts that had dismissed a suit challenging a gift of property by the appellants\u2019 mother, Mst. Pari. The respondents, who are the appellants' sisters, filed the suit, contesting the legitimacy of the gift and the subsequent mutations in the revenue records. The suit was originally dismissed by the Civil Judge and Additional District Judge of Mardan, but the High Court decreed the suit in favor of the respondents. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the alleged gift of property by Mst. Pari to her sons was validly executed and proved. ---2) Whether the mutations made in the revenue records based on the purported gift were valid. ---3) Whether the High Court was justified in setting aside two concurrent judgments and exercising its revisional jurisdiction. ---4) Whether the burden of proof for the gift was properly discharged by the appellants. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, dismissing the appeal. The court held that the appellants had failed to prove that their mother, Mst. Pari, had gifted her property to them. Key documents, including the original statement of Mst. Pari and the mutation records, were not produced in evidence. The identification of Mst. Pari was conducted by an interested witness, Muhammad Zaman, who had personal ties to the appellants. The High Court rightly exercised its revisional jurisdiction as the lower courts had failed to appreciate that the burden of proof for the gift lay on the appellants, who did not discharge this burden adequately. Additionally, the court emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny in cases where female heirs are deprived of their inheritance through gifts. ---- Citations/Precedents: Ihtisham Ali Cheema v.

The arrest followed a tip-off alleging his involvement in the narcotics trade. He applied for post-arrest bail, which was rejected by the trial court (Special Judge CNS/Additional Sessions Judge, Uthal) on June 23, 2022. He then filed the current application for post-arrest bail, arguing that the investigation had been completed, and there was no prior criminal record. --- Issues: 1) Whether the failure to prepare a parcel or obtain samples at the time of recovery from the accused casts doubt on the prosecution's case. ---2) Whether the applicant, having no prior criminal record and with the investigation completed, should be granted bail. ---3) Whether benefit of the doubt can be extended to the applicant at the bail stage. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court observed that the FIR failed to mention whether any sample of the narcotics was obtained or if a parcel of the recovered narcotics was prepared at the spot, raising doubts about the prosecution\u2019s case. Citing the principle that the benefit of the doubt can be extended at the bail stage, the court concluded that this omission warranted further inquiry under section 497(2) of the Cr.P.C.

Respondent No.1 filed a suit for maintenance allowance and recovery of dowry articles worth Rs.12,48,000 on February 28, 2018.

The trial court partially decreed both suits on September 26, 2019, granting maintenance for the iddat period, child support, and some dowry articles or their alternate price. Both parties appealed, and the appellate court modified the decision on November 28, 2019. ----- Issues: 1). Whether the dowry articles claimed by respondent No.1 were correctly assessed. --- 2). Whether the maintenance allowance for respondent No.1 and the minor (respondent No.2) was appropriate, given the petitioner's financial status. ---3). Whether the petitioner was liable to pay delivery expenses. ----4). Whether the admissibility of the dowry list was questionable due to procedural concerns. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court dismissed the petition, upholding the decisions of both the trial court and appellate court.

It was also noted that respondent No.1 had the right to be represented by an agent, being a pardah nashin woman, and her failure to personally appear in court did not undermine her claims. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the dowry list was improperly considered and found that the appellate court rightly modified the maintenance and dowry claims. ----- Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Asim v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Issues: 1) Whether the review petitions filed against the Supreme Court\u2019s short order and detailed judgment should be granted on the basis of claims of valid licenses. ---- 2) Whether the petitioner\u2019s business and other applicants were legally operating within the Margalla Hills National Park, given that licenses had expired or were absent. --- 3) Whether the petitioner\u2019s partner\u2019s commitment to vacate the premises binds the entire partnership firm. --- 4) Whether the non-registration of the petitioner\u2019s firm affected its ability to initiate legal proceedings. --- 5) Whether the petitioners could retract their undertakings to vacate the premises. ---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Licensing and Occupation of Land: The Court held that the petitioner had been issued a one-year license in 1999, which was not renewed after it expired in 2001. The petitioner\u2019s claim that the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) had extended the license was rejected, as it was the Capital Development Authority (CDA) that issued licenses. The petitioner was found to be in illegal occupation of the land. ---- Commitment to Vacate: The Court ruled that the partner's commitment to vacate the land bound the entire firm, as partners act as agents of the firm under the Partnership Act, 1932. Therefore, the firm's argument that the minority partner\u2019s consent to vacate was invalid was rejected. --- Non-Registration of Firm: The Court found that the petitioner\u2019s firm was unregistered, which barred it from initiating legal proceedings under Section 69 of the Partnership Act, 1932. Consequently, the firm could not lawfully file the review petitions or challenge the decision. ---- Environmental Violations: The Court emphasized the severe environmental degradation caused by illegal operations within the protected National Park. It condemned the actions of government officials who had facilitated the illegal businesses and highlighted the need to uphold environmental protections and regulations. Retraction of Undertakings: The Court did not permit the petitioners to retract their previous commitments to vacate the land within three months. The Court noted that reneging on such solemn undertakings would undermine judicial processes, and those attempting to do so would face consequences. ----Outcome: The review petitions were dismissed, and the Supreme Court affirmed that the petitioner and other applicants were illegally occupying land in the National Park. The Court withdrew its previous offer of preferential treatment for future leases and confirmed that no legal right existed for the petitioners to continue operating in the National Park. The Court reiterated the importance of environmental protection and condemned the complicity of officials involved in the illegal occupation of protected land. ----Citations/Precedents: --- Partnership Act, 1932: Section 18: Partner as an agent of the firm.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: M/s Staco Shahid Builders (Appellant) was awarded a contract by the Lahore Cantonment Board (Respondent) for constructing a 250-bed family wing hospital, which was later expanded to a 500-bed teaching hospital. A dispute arose over price variations, leading the appellant to file an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, requesting the appointment of independent arbitrators. The learned Civil Judge/Special Court for Administrative Commercial Cases, Lahore, dismissed the application, stating it was premature and referred the matter to the already appointed arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments (DML&C), Lahore Region. The appellant challenged this order in the present appeal. ----Issues: 1) Whether the arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments, Lahore Region, is impartial, considering his connection with the respondent. ---2) Whether the trial court erred in referring the matter to the pre-appointed arbitrator instead of appointing independent arbitrators as requested by the appellant. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Arbitration Clause: The contract between the parties, signed on August 23, 2018, included an arbitration clause naming the DML&C as the sole arbitrator. The Court found that the parties were bound by this agreement, and the appellant could not later claim impartiality issues with the appointed arbitrator. It held that known relationships between an arbitrator and one of the parties do not automatically invalidate the arbitration agreement. --- Court\u2019s Role in Arbitration: Under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, the court\u2019s role is limited once an arbitrator is named in the contract, and it cannot substitute its choice unless the appointed arbitrator refuses to act or is incapable of acting. The appellant\u2019s claims that the DML&C is biased were deemed hypothetical and unsupported by evidence. --- Appointment of Arbitrator: The Court concluded that the appellant had willingly entered into the contract, which explicitly named the DML&C as arbitrator. Therefore, the Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to refer the matter to the appointed arbitrator, as the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for appointing a different arbitrator. --- Legal Precedents: The Court cited precedents supporting the binding nature of arbitration agreements and the limited grounds for replacing arbitrators. It held that the appellant could approach the Court to challenge the arbitrator\u2019s conduct only after arbitration if there were any signs of misconduct or bias. --- -Outcome: The Lahore High Court dismissed the appeal, ruling that the appellant must proceed with the arbitration under the originally appointed arbitrator (DML&C) as per the contract\u2019s terms. ---- Citations/Precedents: Messrs Commodities Trading International Corporation vs. Trading Corporation of Pakistan Ltd.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (a) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 98 & 3---Regulation of Mines and Oil-fields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act (XXIV of 1948), S. 5---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of Province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Respondent-company was granted relaxation/ exemption of certain rules under R.98 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 in order to enable it to carry out exploration work---Legality---Concerned department of the Provincial Government granted as many as thirteen relaxations to the respondent-company purportedly with a view to enable it to carry out the exploration work without any hindrance---Not only was respondent-company well aware of the restrictions imposed by Statute, but they also attempted to bind future governments to ratify the departures being made from the law---Said relaxations were in the nature of exemptions granted from the application of the rules to respondent-company and the entire Joint Venture exploration project without any reference to the provision of R.3 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, in such circumstances, were rendered nugatory in all substantial aspects---Rule 3 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 provided that except with the previous sanction of the Government, no licence to prospect for any mineral and no lease of mines and minerals shall be granted otherwise than in accordance with said rules---Admittedly, no such previous sanction as envisaged by R.3 was sought by respondent-company or the Provincial Development Authority---Rule 98 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 provided for relaxation of any of the provisions of said Rules in cases of individual hardship and under special circumstances to be recorded in writing, and that too, on certain terms and conditions to be fixed while granting the relaxation---Neither respondent-company nor Provincial Development Authority in seeking relaxation of the rules fulfilled the requirements stated in R. 98 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, namely, showing \"hardship\" and \"special circumstances\"--- Competent authority also failed to determine the terms and conditions to be fixed in granting the relaxations sought for-In absence of the requirements of R. 98 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 being fulfilled in the present case, all relaxations were granted in excess of authority and were entirely beyond the scope of the provisions of the law, and therefore ultra vires the powers granted under R.98 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 read with section 5 of the Regulation of Mines and Oil-fields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act, 1948, and thus void---Under a clause of the Joint Venture agreement respondent-company could have sought only 'consents', 'approvals' or 'assurances', and not 'relaxation' of any rule, but in the present case, in respect of every provision of the agreement, which ran contrary to the provision of any rule of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, relaxation in the name of 'consent, approval and assurance' was sought by the respondent-company--- Respondent-company, therefore, could not be said to have been acting justly and faithfully from the very inception of their relationship with the Provincial Development Authority as contemplated by the parties in one of the clauses of the Joint Venture agreement---Joint Venture exploration agreement in question, therefore, had no legal sanctity and consequently remained an agreement entered into against the provisions of law, hence not enforceable---All the key provisions of Joint Venture agreement were made subject to reliance on relaxations which were illegal and void ab initio, thus illegality seeped to the root of the said agreement, as such, no operative part of the agreement survived to be independently enforceable and the principle of severability could not be applied to save any part thereof---Joint Venture exploration agreement in question was, therefore, void and unenforceable in its entirety under the law.

(c) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 30, 31 & 32---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan--Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Clauses of the Joint Venture agreement concerning grant of prospecting licences and renewal thereof---Legality--- Said clauses of the agreement violated Rules 30, 31 & 32 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Joint Venture exploration agreement in question was, therefore, held to be void and unenforceable. (d) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 27---Rights under a prospecting licence---Scope---Rule 27 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, conferred an exclusive right on the holder of the licence to mine, quarry, bore and search for, etc., for any specified mineral lying or being within, under or throughout the land specified in the licence---Said rule provided an exclusive right to mine for a specified mineral, but did not envisage exclusive possession of the area for which prospecting licence was granted---Right under a prospecting licence was an exclusive right for exploration of the specified minerals, but not the right to exclusive possession of the area in question. (e) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 28 & 42---Contract Act (IX of 1872), S. 29---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Prospecting licence---Respondent- company was granted prospecting licences for exploration in an area, which was in excess of the maximum limit provided by Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Certain clauses of the Joint Venture agreement concerning aggregate area for which prospecting licenses and mining leases were to be granted created uncertainty within the ambit of S.29 of Contract Act, 1872 and were also in violation of Rules 28 and 42 of the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- Joint Venture exploration agreement in question was, therefore, held to be void and unenforceable. Clause 5.3.1 of the Joint Venture exploration agreement provided that the aggregate prospecting area shall not be more than 50 sq km whereas as per clause 5.3.2 of the agreement, where at any time the Joint Venture was active in ten prospecting licences having in aggregate an area of fifty square kilometers, it (respondent- company) shall not be permitted to apply for additional prospecting licences within the exploration area unless it first relinquished from one or more of its existing prospecting licences an area equivalent to the size of the proposed prospecting licence. However, clause 5.10 of Joint Venture agreement provided that the area shown in a map (Schedule B to the said agreement) might be revised so as to accurately represent the current status from time to time of the exploration area including all prospecting licences or mining leases in existence from time to time including the revision or relinquishment of any prospecting licences or mining leases. This clearly nullified clause 5.3.1 in the first instance, and then negatived the provision of R. 28 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, which provided that except as otherwise decided by the Government, a prospecting licence shall not be granted in respect of any area measuring more than 10 square miles, and R.42 of the same Rules, which laid down that the lease shall not be granted in respect of any area of more than five square miles save in case where special exemption was granted by the Government. Initially respondent-company was granted a Prospecting Licence for an area of 50 sq km for exploration, which was illegally extended to 1000 sq km pursuant to the request made by respondent-company and Provincial Development Authority. This part of the Joint Venture agreement was entered into against the letter and spirit of the law. Clause 5.3.1 of the Joint Venture exploration agreement provided that the aggregate prospecting area shall not be more than 50 sq km. However, by virtue of clause 5.10 of the same agreement, the map attached as a Schedule to the agreement, covering an area of 13000 sq km, could be revised so as to accurately represent the current status of the area from time to time. It clearly established that the area was not final and constituted uncertainty within the ambit of section 29 of the Contract Act, 1872. Sheikh Shahabuddin v.

Managing Director, Cholistan Development Authority, Bahawalpur 1998 CLC 1464 and Ahmed Ali Khan v. City District Government, Karachi 2009 MLD 704 ref. (f) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 30 & 31---Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, Rr. 125 & 67---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Prospecting licences for exploration granted to respondent-company---Extension/renewal of such prospecting licences was made in violation of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---At the time of promulgation of Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002 prospecting licence of respondent-company had expired and was not further renewed, as such its rights under the licence ceased and were never protected---Provincial Government, in such circumstances, instead of inviting bids for awarding new exploration licences for Reko Diq area awarded exploration licence to the respondent-company, which was renewed for a further period of 6 years--- Extraordinary and undue favour were granted under the Joint Venture exploration agreement---Joint Venture exploration agreement in question was, therefore, held to be void and unenforceable. Prospecting licences granted to respondent-company were renewed for a period of one year in 1998 and in 1999 and it was extended the facility of prospecting licence in the Reko Diq area for a period of 5 years as against 3 years provided under R. 31 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970. This provision was attempted to be circumvented by issuing a fresh prospecting licence on 21-2-2000 for the same area for 2 years wherein the licensee was given the option to retain the area beyond one year subject to their giving one month's notice in writing of their intention to do so. This was contrary to R. 30 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, which stipulated grant of (new) prospecting licence for a period not exceeding one year. Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, were promulgated on 9-3-2002 and the licences and leases granted prior to the notification of said Rules, which were continuing at that time were protected by means of R.125 of the said Rules. Respondent-company did not have any mineral title at the time of notification of Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002 as fresh prospecting licence issued to it on 21-2-2000 had already expired on 21-2-2002 and was not further renewed. As such, its rights accrued under fresh prospecting licence, having already ceased, were never protected. Since respondent-company did not have any mineral title under the Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, Provincial Government was empowered under R.67 of the said Rules to invite bids to tender for award of exploration licences for the same area. However, Provincial Government did not exercise its prerogative and instead granted exploration licence for the Reko Diq area to the respondent-company, which was renewed for a further period of 6 years. Under the Joint Venture exploration agreement, respondent-company enjoyed rights for exploration in the Reko Diq area between 1994 and 1996; held a prospecting licence for the same area for 5 years and an exploration licence for the same area for 9 years, meaning thereby that the exploration/prospecting facility was extended to respondent-company for a total period of 17 years, which was an extraordinary and undue favour in itself granted under the Joint Venture exploration agreement. (g) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 39---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Confidentiality clause in the said agreement regarding information acquired by the respondent-company in the course of its operations---Legality---Disclosure of information acquired during course of operations---Scope---One of the clauses of the Joint Venture exploration agreement provided that the terms and conditions of the agreement and all mining information acquired by a party by reason of the operation of the agreement shall be confidential---Said clause ran contrary to the provision of R.39 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, which provided that if so required by the licensing authority, the licensee shall, before the return of the deposit made by him, disclose confidentially to the licensing authority all information acquired in the course of the operations carried or the geological formation of any area not taken up by him under a mining lease---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. (h) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----Rr. 65 & 98---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Royalty to be paid to the Government---Procedure to be followed in case of non-payment of such royalty---Scope---Entire procedure to be followed in case of non-payment of royalty in terms of R.65 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 was done away with under the Joint Venture agreement in question---Effect---Joint Venture exploration agreement was held to be void and unenforceable. Rule 65 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 required the licensee or lessee to pay royalty at the rates to be notified by the Government from time to time of all minerals extracted by him. It further laid down that in case of non-payment of royalty within the prescribed time, the first two months shall be treated as grace period whereafter a penalty @ 6% of royalty dues shall be charged in case the payment was made after the expiry of the second month next after the due date. Furthermore, in case royalty along with penalty was not paid until expiry of the fourth month from the due date, the licensee or lessee shall be liable to pay a further penalty of up to Rs.50,000/- as determined by the licensing authority and in case it was not paid until the expiry of the six months after the date it first became due, the licence or lease shall be cancelled forthwith. From the perusal of the relaxation sought by the respondent-company in the present case and the provision of the rule in question, it was clear that the entire procedure to be followed in case of non-payment of royalty was done away with under the Joint Venture exploration agreement. Such a relaxation could not be sought and granted. It was an illegal exercise. (i) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 33---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Payment of annual fee by the licencee---Amount of annual fee to be paid by the respondent-company (licencee) was first reduced and then waived off in relaxation of R.33 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Legality---Competent authority waived off the annual fee, which was to be paid by the respondent-company for a period of three years, without mentioning as to why it was necessary to exempt the company from paying such fee---Respondent-company had been exempted from the payment of annual fee in relaxation of R. 33 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---No justification was provided for such waiver, which was an extraordinary treatment meted out to respondent-company whereby a (huge) loss was caused to the public exchequer without any justification whatsoever having been brought on the record---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. (j) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Contract Act (IX of 1872), S. 23--- UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2010, Art. 3.2.7---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Lack of transparency---Lack of understanding of the issue on part of the Provincial Government---Manipulation of Provincial Government by foreign companies---Effect--- Neither any tenders were invited nor any public advertisement was made before the said agreement---Such handling of an issue of great public importance was against public policy because it certainly caused injury to the public good---Joint Venture exploration agreement was entered into in violation of a large number of provisions of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, therefore, it was opposed to public policy and was hit by S.23 of the Contract Act, 1872---Different foreign companies (respondents) by means of the Joint Venture exploration agreement and other related agreements preyed upon the huge gaps in understanding on the part of Provincial Government of large scale mineral extraction and were in a distinct position to manipulate and dominate the will of the Provincial Government, therefore, Joint Venture agreement in question was unenforceable under Art.3.2.7 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (2010)---Various provisions in the Joint Venture exploration agreement and other agreements related to it, purported to bind the (Provincial) Government and its functionaries in the discharge of their statutory duties, which was not permissible, and was also opposed to public policy in terms of S. 23 of the Contract Act, 1872---Joint Venture exploration agreement and all other agreements related to it were, thus, void and unenforceable. No initiative was taken by the Provincial Development Authority or any other department of the Provincial Government to publish advertisement in the press and invite tenders with a view to providing opportunity to other investors in the field of mining to come forward and compete with others. No doubt foreign investment in any modern economy was to be encouraged by all means, but all such activities were required to be carried out observing due process of law, which alone was a sure guarantee of the protection and promotion of the public interest. In the present case, it appeared that Provincial Development Authority entered into negotiations with respondent-company and took up the issue of grant of exploration rights with Provincial Government in the most haphazard manner. Provincial Development Authority ought to have provided adequate opportunities to concerned departments for proper examination of the case and it was in neither party's interest to enter into an agreement without considering its pros and cons. Processing of the matter by Provincial Government substantiated that public advertisements were not resorted to in the interest of transparency and to obtain the best competitive price for the disposal of public property, i.e., mineral resources in Reko Diq, and thereby denied participation to other investors of the field to the detriment of the general public, and especially the people of the province. Such handling of an issue of great public importance was against public policy as well because it certainly caused injury to the public good and, therefore, provided a basis for denying the legality of the transaction in question. Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872 provided that the consideration or object of an agreement was lawful, unless it was forbidden by law; or was of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or was fraudulent; or involved or implied injury to the person or property of another; or the court regarded it as immoral, or opposed to public policy. Every agreement for which the object or consideration was unlawful was void. In the present case, Joint Venture exploration agreement was entered into in violation of a large number of provisions of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, therefore, it was opposed to public policy and was hit by section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. Nothing had been brought on the record to show that the Finance Department, which was required under Balochistan Government Rules of Business 1976 to scrutinize such a joint venture, had approved the project in question. An attempt was made to take undue advantage out of the political instability prevailing at that time, inasmuch as at that time, a Caretaker Government was in place. Different foreign companies (respondents) by means of the Joint Venture exploration agreement and other related agreements preyed upon the huge gaps in understanding on the part of Provincial Government of large scale mineral extraction and were in a distinct position to manipulate and dominate the will of the Provincial Government. Under Art.3.2.7 of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (2010) a contract which had been conceived by a party seeking to take unfair advantage of the other party's dependence, economic distress or its improvidence, ignorance, inexperience and lack of bargaining skill could not be enforced. Various recitals in the Joint Venture exploration agreement and other agreements related to it, purported to bind the (Provincial) Government and its functionaries in the discharge of their statutory duties, which was not permissible. Such aspect too was opposed to public policy in terms of section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. Accordingly, all the said instruments were void and not enforceable in the courts of law.

(k) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Irregularities in the execution of the said agreement---Record showed that the executant of the Joint Venture agreement was an officer who held dual position of Chairman of Provincial Development Authority and Additional Chief Secretary at the relevant time---Said two positions were very distinct in the eyes of the law; the first was an office holder in a statutory incorporated body while the latter was an officer of the Provincial Government authorized to represent the Government---In the former position, officer in question forwarded the case to the Provincial Government whereupon in the latter position he chaired the meeting wherein decisions regarding the Joint Venture agreement were taken---Such circumstances made it a clear case of conflict of interest---Record also showed that officer in question showed a visible haste on his part to execute the Joint Venture agreement, when in fact there was a greater burden on him not only to be fair in his adherence to the law, but also to disassociate himself from the matter as far as his position as applicant was concerned---Record also showed that officer in question disregarded caution sounded by several departments---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. (l) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R.14---Companies Ordinance (XLVII of 1984), Ss. 451, 452 & 456---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---\"Mining licence or lease only to be granted to a company incorporated in Pakistan\"--- Scope---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Plea of petitioner that neither respondent-company was registered under the Companies Ordinance, 1984 nor did it have any place of business in Pakistan on the date of execution of Joint-Venture agreement as required by the said Ordinance, therefore, respondent-company was not competent to apply for and have a grant of mineral licences in terms of Rule 14 of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Validity---Rule 14 of the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 provided that a licence or lease shall only be granted or assigned to a company incorporated in Pakistan---Joint Venture agreement in question itself provided that the law applicable to it shall be the law of Pakistan, including the principles of international law as duly acknowledged and agreed by the parties---Every foreign company operating in Pakistan was required under the law to obtain a permission to establish a liaison office or branch office---Companies that were issued such permission to establish an office registered with the Board of Investment were regulated by the Companies Ordinance, 1984---Sections 451 & 452 of the said Ordinance, laid down requirements for documents to be delivered to the Registrar of Companies by foreign companies and returns to be delivered where alterations were made in documents---Respondent-company was incorporated in a foreign country and for all practical and legal purposes, it was to be treated as a foreign entity for all references to its nationality vis- -vis rights and obligations accruing under the law---Respondent-company failed to produce before the court certificates of registration from the Board of Investment or the Registrar of Companies issued in its favour---Under S.456 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, in the absence of such registration, a foreign company could not institute legal proceedings without fulfilling requirements of Ss.451 & 452 of the said Ordinance, and it lost its rights to bring a suit or legal action for any liability arising in its favour out of any contract it might have entered into in default of such registration---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. Hala Spinning Mills Ltd. v. International Finance Corporation 2002 SCMR 450 ref. (m) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Registration Act (XVI of 1908), S. 17---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Respondent-company transferring its interest under the Joint Venture agreement to another company without getting the said agreement registered- --Legality---Section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act, 1908 provided that an instrument, which purported or operated to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future any right or interest of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable property shall be registered---In the present case, both parties to the Joint Venture agreement failed to get the agreement registered under S.17 of the Registration Act, 1908---Subsequent assignment of rights under the Joint Venture agreement purported to be done through another agreement was also not registered in terms of S.17 of the Registration Act, 1908---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. (n) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3 & Part III--- Regulation of Mines and Oil-fields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act (XXIV of 1948), S.2---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Provincial Government was purportedly made part of the said agreement---Sovereignty of Provincial Government---Plea of petitioner was that if Provincial Government itself had become a party to the Joint Venture agreement, it would then be bound by all the decisions taken by the operating committee of the Joint Venture, where decisions would be taken on the basis of voting strength, determined by percentage interest in the Joint Venture; that all powers relating to prospecting and mining operations would then be vesting in the respondent-company and Provincial Government, which was the licensing authority for mines, would be performing its functions subject to direction by the respondent- company and that all this was tantamount to subordinating sovereign rights of the province to a foreign company for the latter's monetary interests---Validity---Joint Venture agreement provided for its own framework for the transfer of interests under the contract for mining development far away from the statutory framework provided in the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970---Joint Venture agreement in question was tantamount to usurpation of executive and legislative prerogatives---No exemption or relaxation of rules could grant a foreign company the power to create ad hoc rules to apply to a specific contract with regard to licences issued by a statutory body---Joint Venture agreement not only made relevant rules redundant, but also created the possibility of mining development without Government approval and even to the exclusion of the Provincial Development Authority---Joint Venture agreement also provided for the inclusion of other parties in the future as a mining consortium without recourse to government licensing or authorization---Terms of the Joint Venture agreement gave it an overriding effect over the legislative process and thereby attempted to make subservient the laws of a sovereign country, which could not be approved--- Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. Part III of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970 provided for the issuance of a mining lease and the statutory procedure for making applications for the same. In the absence of the application of Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970, Joint Venture agreement in question attempted to exercise the statutory right of creating rules governing its operations, which was a right reserved for competent authority under section 2 of Regulation of Mines and Oil-fields and Mineral Development (Government Control) Act, 1948. Joint Venture agreement provided for its own framework for the transfer of interests under the contract for mining development far away from the statutory framework provided in the Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970. It utterly disregarded all the rules provided therein and attempted to create an ad hoc system of awarding the parties mining leases automatically. It declared that prospecting licences issued by the Provincial Government shall be 'converted into' mining licences. This went much beyond the scope of an exemption and was tantamount to usurpation of executive and legislative prerogatives. No exemption or relaxation of rules could grant a foreign company the power to create ad hoc rules to apply to a specific contract with regard to licences issued by a statutory body. Joint Venture agreement provided that where the Joint Venture or a participating party elected to develop a mine, then, subject only to compliance with routine Government requirements, it shall be entitled to convert the relevant prospecting licence(s) into mining licences so as to give a secure title over the required mining area. This not only rendered the rules redundant, but also created the possibility of continuing 'mining development' without Government approval and even to the exclusion of the Provincial Development Authority. It also disregarded the terms and conditions of the prospecting licences issued to the respondent-company by the concerned Directorate of Mineral Development, which, inter alia, provided that the licence would not confer upon respondent-company any right to renewal of the prospecting licence or grant of a mining lease over the area or any part thereof unless the prospecting or work obligations as required under the licence had been carried out to the satisfaction of the said Directorate. Besides, Joint Venture agreement provided for the inclusion of other parties in the future as a mining consortium without recourse to government licensing or authorization. Joint Venture agreement also provided that in case of change in legislation, which was applicable to the agreement, if the change or the new provision was more favourable to the Joint Venture or one of the parties than the relevant laws, Acts, rules or regulations in effect on the date the agreement was signed, the Joint Venture and the party concerned shall promptly apply to receive the benefits of such change or new provision. However, if, on account of the change or new provision, the economic benefits to any party or the Joint Venture existing, or to arise under the Joint Venture, were materially and adversely affected, directly or indirectly, then Joint Venture agreement shall continue to be implemented in accordance with its original terms. Clearly this gave an overriding effect to Joint Venture agreement over the legislative process and thereby attempted to make subservient the laws of a sovereign country, which could not be approved. (o) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Balochistan Development Authority Act (X of 1974), Ss. 3(2), 16(1)(b)(i) & 17(6)--- Contract Act (IX of 1872), Ss. 20 & 196---Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 1976, R. 7(2)---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan--- Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company--- Provincial Government was subsequently made party to the said agreement by the Provincial Development Authority, which purportedly acted as an agent of the Provincial Government---Legality---Uncertainty as to the relationship between principal and agent---\"Mistake of fact\"---Effect---Provincial Government was purportedly made a party to the Joint Venture agreement by way of an addendum to the agreement---While signing the said addendum Provincial Development Authority purportedly acted as an agent of the Provincial Government under the Joint Venture agreement, which was a mistake of fact, therefore, the same was void under S.20 of the Contract Act, 1872--- Provincial Development Authority possessed its own legal personality, distinct and separate from the Provincial Government---Balochistan Development Authority Act, 1974 did not authorize the Provincial Development Authority to act as an agent of the Provincial Government---By means of the addendum, in the name of ratification in terms of S.196 of the Contract Act, 1872, instead of making amendments in the Joint Venture agreement, its entire complexion was changed--- Provincial Development Authority while entering into the addendum remained in a state of confusion as to whether Joint Venture agreement was, or any subsequent agreement on the subject had, to be entered into by it independently of any other department of the Provincial Government---Such confusion on the part of Provincial Development Authority as well as Provincial Government led to a fundamental \"uncertainty\" and ambiguity in the Joint Venture agreement, which rendered the contract void ab initio---Joint Venture agreement suffered from \"uncertainty\" as to the parties to the agreement and was void ab initio. As per the definition clause of Joint Venture agreement, \"parties\" (to the agreement) meant respondent- company and Provincial Development Authority. Both Provincial and the Federal Government were entities outside the ambit of \"parties\" as defined in the Joint Venture agreement. However by execution of an addendum, which was signed some 7 years after the signing of the Joint Venture agreement, Provincial Government was purportedly made a party to the agreement. The opening page of the addendum recited that the same was made between the Governor of the province for and on behalf of the province, and the Provincial Development Authority. Thus, in the Addendum, as against the original bipartite agreement, a tripartite agreement was executed, and Provincial Government was purported to be made a party. Such an assumption constituted a \"mistake of fact\". Merely because Governor of the province was mentioned in the title of the Joint Venture agreement would not mean that Provincial Government had become a party to the agreement. Addendum was a device to indirectly bring Provincial Government into the pale of the Joint Venture agreement, which object could only be achieved by following the course provided under the law. All clarifications and ratifications provided in the addendum were based on a mistake of fact within the contemplation of section 20 of the Contract Act, 1872. Such a \"mistake of fact\" on the part of respondent- company made the contract void and unenforceable. Inclusion of Provincial Government as a new party to the Joint Venture agreement required an affirming signature under the hand of a duly authorized representative or agent of the Provincial Government in terms of R.7 of the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 1976, however the same was not done in the present case. An undated authorization letter on a plain paper was got signed from the then Governor of the province purporting to authorize the Provincial Development Authority to sign the addendum on behalf of the Governor. Purported authorization by the Governor to sign the agreement as an agent in favour of Provincial Development Authority was through a note by the Governor titled 'Authorization Letter' which was not printed on the Governor's letterhead, carried no date, notification number, nor was it addressed to any office or authority or even stamped. Neither was there any supporting documentation, nor did the said letter provide a reference to a decision of the Cabinet on the matter. Approval obtained from the Governor on an undated plain paper was improper and untenable in the eyes of law. By means of the addendum, in the name of ratification in terms of section 196 of the Contract Act, 1872, instead of making amendments in the Joint Venture agreement, its entire complexion was changed. Provincial Government, in the present case was at all times aware of the actions of Provincial Development Authority as being performed by the latter in its own name and authority. The principle of ratification as envisaged in S.196 of the Contract Act, 1872 was not applicable. As such, the ratification purported to be made in the addendum was of no consequence. All agreements signed subsequent to the Joint Venture agreement were also premised on a mistake of fact that Provincial Development Authority was an agent of the Provincial Government under the Joint Venture agreement, therefore, the same were also void under S.20 of the Contract Act, 1872. At no stage of the proceedings, was any document creating relationship of principal and agent between Provincial Government and Provincial Development Authority produced or referred to. Balochistan Development Authority Act, 1974 did not authorize the Provincial Development Authority to act as an agent of the Provincial Government, rather the said Act required Provincial Development Authority to seek approval of the Provincial Government in certain matters while performing its functions enumerated in the said Act. Provincial Development Authority possessed its own legal personality, distinct and separate from the Provincial Government and was not even listed as an attached department under any of the Departments of Provincial Government in the Balochistan Government Rules of Business, 1976. Provincial Development Authority while entering into the addendum remained in a state of confusion as to whether Joint Venture agreement was, or any subsequent agreement on the subject had, to be entered into by it independently of any other department of the Provincial Government. All that Provincial Development Authority was required to do was to seek approval of the Provincial Government through its Board of Directors for the project of mineral exploration in terms of section 4 of Balochistan Development Authority Act, 1974 and enter into a Joint Venture Agreement in terms of section 17 read with section 16 of the same Act. This confusion on the part of Provincial Development Authority as well as hierarchy of Provincial Government led to a fundamental \"uncertainty\" and ambiguity in the Joint Venture agreement, which rendered the contract void ab initio. Provincial Government was not a party to the Joint Venture agreement, therefore, it could not be said to have entered into an agreement with any company or a prospective licensee of the nature referred to in said agreement or the addendum. Joint Venture agreement suffered from uncertainty as to the parties to the agreement and was void ab initio. (p) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Provincial Government made party to the said agreement--- Percentage interest of each party in the said agreement: Respondent-company entitled to 75% interest under the said agreement, while Provincial Government/Provincial Development Authority was given 25% \"free carried interest up to discovery\"---Adequacy---Provincial Development Authority was liable to bear a host of expenditures in connection with the Joint Venture activities, and it could not be said that Provincial Government was entitled to 25% \"free carried interest up to discovery\"---Joint Venture agreement in question was entered into for an inadequate consideration as regards the percentage interest of Provincial Development Authority---Joint Venture exploration agreement was, thus, held to be void and unenforceable. During mineral exploration both the lessor and lessee did not get any return until the activity reached the final stage, i.e., extraction of the mineral in question, its smelting and thereafter its marketing. Therefore, to say that Provincial Development authority would be getting 25% interest from the inception of the agreement did not reflect the correct position. Consideration of Provincial Government under the Joint Venture agreement could not in fact be termed as 25%. Provincial Development Authority was liable to bear a host of expenditures in connection with the Joint Venture activities. Certain clauses of the Joint Venture agreement provided that the costs of activities and operations within a mining area shall be paid for by the participating parties in proportion to their respective percentage interests; that upon minerals being produced from the mining area, respondent-company shall be entitled to recover from Provincial Development Authority (i) all of those costs (principal sums) which respondent-company contributed on behalf of Provincial Development Authority to the mining development and (ii) compounding interest accruing on the principal sums (with interest); that Provincial Development Authority would provide support/services to respondent-company in terms of appropriate administrative support as required for the obtaining of all leases, licences, claims, permits or other authorities of any kind whatsoever being necessary for the conduct of Joint Venture activities; that Provincial Development Authority would be responsible for providing interpretation and liaison services as might be reasonably required and it would also be responsible for providing all mining information and any other relevant information in its possession; that Provincial Development Authority would provide accommodation of a reasonable standard for persons involved in the conduct of the Joint Venture activities and would also be responsible to provide suitable security arrangements for persons engaged upon Joint Venture activities within the exploration area or whilst such persons were in the course of travelling to or from the exploration area; that Provincial Development Authority would be liable for negotiating all necessary land access agreements in connection with further prospecting licences and also for liaising with relevant Provincial Government and local government authorities and with affected local landholders to ensure that good relations were maintained between the Joint Venture and other persons during the conduct of Joint Venture activities. Provincial Development Authority was liable to bear a host of expenditures in connection with the Joint Venture activities, and it could not be said that Provincial Government was entitled to 25% \"free carried interest up to discovery\". Joint Venture agreement was entered into for an inadequate consideration as regards the percentage interest of Provincial Development Authority. (q) Contract Act (IX of 1872)--- ----S.196---Agency by ratification--- Scope--- One of the established essentials of ratification in law was that the purported agent must have been acting in the name of the purported principal, always having been representing himself as a lawful agent of the same--- Acts done by a person in his own name and in his separate legal capacity were not capable of subsequent ratification by another person.

(r) Contract Act (IX of 1872)--- ----Ss. 62 & 23---Novation, rescission and alteration of contract---Novation of contract, which is based on an illegal contract---Enforcement of---Scope---Section 62 of the Contract Act 1872, dealt with novation, rescission and alteration of contract, and provided that if the parties to a contract agreed to substitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract need not be performed---Necessary element for the execution of a valid novation of contract was the validity of the original agreement that was to be substituted---Where an agreement was void, all subsequent alterations, variations or novations based upon such agreement would also be invalid---When a contract was unlawful or illegal as being prohibited by a specific provision of the statute, it could not be enforced, although the parties might have entered into a novation of the contract on the basis of such unlawful or illegal consideration---Further, a collateral illegal contract or an earlier illegal contract, in spite of a novation would, still remain illegal and a court of law would decline to grant any relief to any one of the parties even in respect of such a collateral contract, or an earlier illegal contract, which was the basis of the suit contract and on which a cause of action might be founded---Court of law should decline to enforce even a perfectly innocent and legal contract where it arose out of a collateral illegal contract or an immoral contract or any legal contract which had for its basis an earlier illegal or immoral contract, in spite of the fact that the parties might have entered into a novation--- Where there was a direct connection between a fresh contract after novation and the earlier illegal contract or the earlier collateral contract, the novated contract would still continue to be illegal or immoral and the court would refuse to enforce the same in view of the provisions of S.23 of the Contract Act, 1872.

(t) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Recognition and Enforcement (Arbitration Agreements and Foreign Arbitral Awards) Act (XVII of 2011), S.2(a) & Sched.---Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"New York\" Convention), Art. 11(3)---United Nations Convention against Corruption 2003, Art. 34--- Constitution of Pakistan, Arts.185(3) & 184(3)---Copper and gold reserves in Reko Diq area of province of Balochistan---Joint Venture exploration agreement between Provincial Development Authority and respondent-company---Arbitration proceedings in connection with said agreement were initiated before international forums---Jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Pakistan to decide the legality of said agreement in such circumstances---Scope---Law applicable to the Joint Venture agreement in question, was the law of Pakistan, therefore, the courts of Pakistan were the appropriate forum to decide the legality of the said agreement---Respondent-company first obtained interim orders (from the courts in Pakistan), but then rushed to international forums without first exhausting the legal remedies available to them under the law of Pakistan, which was the applicable law of the agreement---Article 11(3) of the New York Convention stated that the court of a contracting State, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the parties had made an agreement within the meaning of the said Article shall, at the request of one of the parties, refer the parties to arbitration, unless it found that the agreement was null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed---Article 34 of the UN Convention against Corruption 2003 provided that with due regard to the right of third parties, acquired in good faith, each State party shall take measures, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its domestic law, to address consequences of corruption, and, in such context, States parties might consider corruption as a relevant factor in legal proceedings to annul or rescind a contract, withdraw a concession or other similar instrument or take any other remedial action---Supreme Court of Pakistan, in such circumstances, could decide upon (the legality of) the Joint Venture agreement in question and documents related to it. (u) Balochistan Mining Concession Rules, 1970--- ----R. 3---Balochistan Mineral Rules, 2002, R. 7---Minerals in land---Scope---Minerals in land were nature's endowment for the people of the country--Minerals were in nature of public trust---Rules regarding minerals acted as guardians of the said public trust---Title in minerals could be given away only in accordance with law and not through any other means---Adherence to rules regarding minerals ensured that minerals were exploited and given away in national interest. (v) Words and phrases--- ----\"Sovereignty of State\"---Meaning and scope. Concept of sovereignty meant supreme authority in a political community. A sovereign State was often described as one that was free and independent. In its internal affairs it had undivided jurisdiction over all persons and property within its territory. It claimed the right to regulate its economic life without regard for its neighbours and to increase its armaments without limit. No other nation might rightfully interfere in its domestic affairs. In its external relations, it claimed the right to enforce its own conception of rights and to declare war. In political theory, the ultimate authority of the State in the decision-making process and in the maintenance of order was called sovereignty. Its supreme and independent power was exercised in the domestic and foreign policy. As per dictionary meaning, sovereignty was supreme and unrestricted power, as of a State; the position, dominion, or authority of a sovereign, and an independent State. Sovereignty was manifested above all in the way a State functioned, but it was most apparent in the system of State rights, including sovereign rights. It is precisely the State's powers that ensured the State's authority and thus its sovereignty. Only State power could authoritatively influence and, when necessary, exercise coercion on all aspects of life in human society. State power was in effect universal and sovereign in nature. A State's domestic sovereignty was closely linked with its independence from foreign powers. (w) International law--- ----Contract---Where a contract is entered into with a foreign national or a foreign company, it is governed by the municipal laws of the country where the contract is executed subject to any special provision to the contrary incorporated in the contract.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Gift--- ----Donor, a pardanashin lady---Requirements---Exclusion of sisters from inheritance---Gift of property purportedly made by mother to her sons to the exclusion of daughters---Proof and burden of proof--- Document whereon the statement of the mother/purported donor was allegedly recorded and on which she was stated to have affixed her thumb impression was not produced; and instead a simple photo copy of such document was produced, which neither constituted primary nor secondary evidence---Burden of proof to establish the gift laid on the sons/appellants but they failed to discharge such burden---Appellants had alleged that the gift was made in the presence of a person \"G\", but he did not testify---Both sides maintained that the purported donor was an old, illiterate, parda observing lady---Paper on which her purported statement was recorded bore a thumb impression---Appellants had to establish that the purported donor had impressed her thumb impression on it but they made no effort to prove it, which they could have done by having it forensically examined and having it compared with some document on which she had admittedly impressed her thumb, such as her identity card and or her passport---Person who recorded the alleged statement of purported donor, did not make any effort to verify her identity through any means, let alone her national identify card/passport---Said person also did not take simple precautions, such as enquiring from the purported donor about her family members and the reason why her children were not present---Since an elderly parda observing illiterate lady intended to divest her entire property in favour of only two of her children, every precaution should have been taken to ensure that the parda clad person who was produced before the revenue officer was actually the purported donor---Subsection (7) of S. 42 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Land Revenue Act, 1967 required that the person from whom the property was being acquired was to be identified by, \"two respectable persons whose signatures or thumb-impressions shall be obtained by the Revenue Officer\"---Such procedure was not followed in the present case---Furthermore the register of mutations was not produced, nor verified copies therefrom exhibited---Appellants had completely failed to establish the purported gift in their favour---Appeal was dismissed with the observation that the courts exercised extreme caution when faced with 'gifts' which deprived female members of a family. Barkat Ali v. Muhammad Ismail, 2002 SCMR 1938 ref. --- Background: This case involves an appeal against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, which overturned two concurrent judgments from the lower courts that had dismissed a suit challenging a gift of property by the appellants\u2019 mother, Mst. Pari. The respondents, who are the appellants' sisters, filed the suit, contesting the legitimacy of the gift and the subsequent mutations in the revenue records. The suit was originally dismissed by the Civil Judge and Additional District Judge of Mardan, but the High Court decreed the suit in favor of the respondents. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the alleged gift of property by Mst. Pari to her sons was validly executed and proved. ---2) Whether the mutations made in the revenue records based on the purported gift were valid. ---3) Whether the High Court was justified in setting aside two concurrent judgments and exercising its revisional jurisdiction. ---4) Whether the burden of proof for the gift was properly discharged by the appellants. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, dismissing the appeal. The court held that the appellants had failed to prove that their mother, Mst. Pari, had gifted her property to them. Key documents, including the original statement of Mst. Pari and the mutation records, were not produced in evidence. The identification of Mst. Pari was conducted by an interested witness, Muhammad Zaman, who had personal ties to the appellants. The High Court rightly exercised its revisional jurisdiction as the lower courts had failed to appreciate that the burden of proof for the gift lay on the appellants, who did not discharge this burden adequately. Additionally, the court emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny in cases where female heirs are deprived of their inheritance through gifts. ---- Citations/Precedents: Ihtisham Ali Cheema v.

Muhammad Asim v. Mst. Samro Begum and others PLD 2018 SC 819 and Qalandri Bibi v. Mst. Irum Bibi and others 2019 YLR 86 rel. ----- Background: The petitioner and respondent No.1 were married on June 22, 2017, but their relationship deteriorated, leading to multiple legal suits. Respondent No.1 filed a suit for maintenance allowance and recovery of dowry articles worth Rs.12,48,000 on February 28, 2018. She later gave birth to respondent No.2, Ghulam Ahmad, on May 9, 2018, and filed another suit on September 1, 2018, seeking maintenance allowance for the child and delivery expenses. The trial court partially decreed both suits on September 26, 2019, granting maintenance for the iddat period, child support, and some dowry articles or their alternate price. Both parties appealed, and the appellate court modified the decision on November 28, 2019. ----- Issues: 1). Whether the dowry articles claimed by respondent No.1 were correctly assessed. --- 2). Whether the maintenance allowance for respondent No.1 and the minor (respondent No.2) was appropriate, given the petitioner's financial status. ---3). Whether the petitioner was liable to pay delivery expenses. ----4). Whether the admissibility of the dowry list was questionable due to procedural concerns. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court dismissed the petition, upholding the decisions of both the trial court and appellate court. The court found that the petitioner failed to provide evidence of his financial status, thus drawing adverse inferences against him as per precedent. It was also noted that respondent No.1 had the right to be represented by an agent, being a pardah nashin woman, and her failure to personally appear in court did not undermine her claims. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the dowry list was improperly considered and found that the appellate court rightly modified the maintenance and dowry claims. ----- Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Asim v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: M/s Staco Shahid Builders (Appellant) was awarded a contract by the Lahore Cantonment Board (Respondent) for constructing a 250-bed family wing hospital, which was later expanded to a 500-bed teaching hospital. A dispute arose over price variations, leading the appellant to file an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, requesting the appointment of independent arbitrators. The learned Civil Judge/Special Court for Administrative Commercial Cases, Lahore, dismissed the application, stating it was premature and referred the matter to the already appointed arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments (DML&C), Lahore Region. The appellant challenged this order in the present appeal. ----Issues: 1) Whether the arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments, Lahore Region, is impartial, considering his connection with the respondent. ---2) Whether the trial court erred in referring the matter to the pre-appointed arbitrator instead of appointing independent arbitrators as requested by the appellant. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Arbitration Clause: The contract between the parties, signed on August 23, 2018, included an arbitration clause naming the DML&C as the sole arbitrator. The Court found that the parties were bound by this agreement, and the appellant could not later claim impartiality issues with the appointed arbitrator. It held that known relationships between an arbitrator and one of the parties do not automatically invalidate the arbitration agreement. --- Court\u2019s Role in Arbitration: Under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, the court\u2019s role is limited once an arbitrator is named in the contract, and it cannot substitute its choice unless the appointed arbitrator refuses to act or is incapable of acting. The appellant\u2019s claims that the DML&C is biased were deemed hypothetical and unsupported by evidence. --- Appointment of Arbitrator: The Court concluded that the appellant had willingly entered into the contract, which explicitly named the DML&C as arbitrator. Therefore, the Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to refer the matter to the appointed arbitrator, as the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for appointing a different arbitrator. --- Legal Precedents: The Court cited precedents supporting the binding nature of arbitration agreements and the limited grounds for replacing arbitrators. It held that the appellant could approach the Court to challenge the arbitrator\u2019s conduct only after arbitration if there were any signs of misconduct or bias. --- -Outcome: The Lahore High Court dismissed the appeal, ruling that the appellant must proceed with the arbitration under the originally appointed arbitrator (DML&C) as per the contract\u2019s terms. ---- Citations/Precedents: Messrs Commodities Trading International Corporation vs. Trading Corporation of Pakistan Ltd.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Conviction upheld --- Background: This case involves Ali Hassan alias Achoo, who was convicted for the murders of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and his son Subhan, as well as the attempted murder of Muhammad Mudassar, in connection with a previous sodomy case. Ali Hassan and co-accused were charged under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), including 302(b), 324, 337A(i), 449, 109, and 34. The trial court sentenced Ali Hassan to death for the murders and acquitted the other accused. Ali Hassan appealed his conviction. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the conviction and death sentence of Ali Hassan for the murder of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and Subhan are supported by sufficient evidence. ---2) Whether the medical evidence supports the prosecution\u2019s case. ---3) Whether the eye-witness accounts, consisting of related and interested witnesses, are reliable and credible. ---4) Whether the delay in recording the post-mortem and the statement of the injured witness raises doubts about the prosecution's case. ---5) Whether the acquittal of co-accused weakens the case against Ali Hassan. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Conviction: The Lahore High Court upheld Ali Hassan's conviction under Sections 302(b), 324, 337A(i), and 449 PPC. The Court found that the prosecution provided cogent and trustworthy evidence, including eye-witness accounts from family members and medical reports, confirming the injuries and deaths. --- Medical and Ocular Evidence: The medical evidence, although showing a minor discrepancy in the location of the injury, was consistent with the prosecution's account of the murders. The Court ruled that such minor inconsistencies do not discredit the overall prosecution narrative. --- Eyewitness Credibility: Despite being related to the victims, the Court held that the eyewitnesses\u2019 testimonies were reliable, as they were consistent and firmly withstood cross-examination. The injured witness, a child, was also deemed competent and credible. --- Post-Mortem Delay: The delay in the post-mortem and the recording of the injured witness\u2019s statement was justified due to the urgency of saving the injured child. The Court ruled that this delay did not affect the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s case. --- Acquittal of Co-Accused: The Court maintained that the acquittal of the co-accused did not undermine the case against Ali Hassan because the roles attributed to them were different and no direct evidence was presented against them for causing the deaths. --- Death Sentence: The Court confirmed the death sentence, emphasizing that the brutal nature of the crime, involving the murder of a father and his young son, justified the capital punishment. No mitigating circumstances were found to reduce the sentence. ---- Citations/Precedents: Shamsher Ahmad vs. The State (2022 SCMR 1931) Muhammad Asif vs. Mehboob Alam (2020 SCMR 837) Maskeen Ullah vs. The State (2023 SCMR 1568) Amjad Javed vs. The State (2002 SCMR 1247) Muhammad Abbas vs. The State (2023 SCMR 487) Abdur Rauf vs. The State (2003 SCMR 522) Ali Taj vs. The State (2023 SCMR 900) Muhammad Hanif vs. The State (2023 SCMR 2016) Muhammad Yaqoob vs. The State (2021 SCMR 1387)",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Bilqees Bibi, the petitioner, filed for post-arrest bail after being implicated in a murder case registered as FIR No. 1508 dated September 28, 2023, under sections 302, 148, 149, 109, and 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The case revolves around a triple murder, where the complainant alleged that the petitioner's family was angry over a love marriage between the complainant's brother and Mst. Laiba Bibi, the petitioner's relative. On September 28, 2023, the complainant and her family were invited by the petitioner\u2019s co-accused, Kaneez Bibi, to her house under the pretext of reconciling over the marriage. Once at the house, two armed co-accused, Usman and Arslan, allegedly shot and killed the complainant\u2019s relatives, Naseem Akhtar, Zaigham Abbas, and Mst. Laiba Bibi. The petitioner was accused of raising a \"lalkara\" (commanding shout) to kill the victims. ---Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the case, based solely on a joint \"lalkara,\" is sufficient to deny bail. ---2) Whether there is sufficient evidence against the petitioner to warrant continued detention, particularly given her lack of direct involvement in the murders. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Holding: The court granted post-arrest bail to the petitioner. ---Reasoning: No Direct Role in the Murders: The petitioner was not directly involved in the killing of the victims. The only accusation against her was that she raised a joint \"lalkara\" encouraging the co-accused to kill the complainant party. The court found that such an accusation, without more substantial evidence, was insufficient to deny bail. ----Benefit of Doubt at Bail Stage: The court applied the principle of extending the benefit of doubt at the bail stage, as outlined in Resham Khan and another vs. The State (2021 SCMR 2011), ruling that the case against the petitioner required further inquiry. ----Distinguishable Role: The petitioner was unarmed and did not directly participate in the shooting, which distinguishes her role from those who physically carried out the murders. The court noted that the allegation of merely raising a \"lalkara\" is easy to level but difficult to prove. ----Vicarious Liability: The issue of the petitioner\u2019s vicarious liability (being held responsible for the acts of others) would be determined at trial, and bail cannot be withheld as punishment when the case against her calls for further inquiry. ----Heinousness of Offense Not Grounds for Denial of Bail: The court emphasized that the mere heinousness of the crime is not sufficient to deny bail when the petitioner\u2019s entitlement to bail is otherwise established, as per Nasir Khan vs. Waseel Gul and another (PLJ 2009 SC 957) and Husnain Mustafa v. The State (2019 SCMR 1914). ----Petitioner\u2019s Age and Health: The petitioner is a 50-year-old woman with no direct involvement in the murders, and her continued detention served no further purpose as the investigation had concluded. ----Outcome: The petitioner was granted post-arrest bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 500,000 with two sureties. ----Citations/Precedents: Resham Khan and another vs. The State (2021 SCMR 2011) Muhammad Sarfraz Ansari vs. The State (PLD 2021 SC 738) Ali Raza vs. The State (2022 SCMR 1245) Nasir Khan vs. Waseel Gul (PLJ 2009 SC 957) Husnain Mustafa v. The State (2019 SCMR 1914) Khair Muhammad vs. The State (2021 SCMR 130) Key Takeaway: The court ruled that the petitioner's mere alleged participation through raising a \"lalkara\" without direct involvement in the crime was insufficient to deny her bail. The court emphasized that the benefit of doubt could be extended at the bail stage, and the case required further inquiry, particularly regarding her vicarious liability.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail granted ---- The petitioner, sought pre-arrest bail after the Lahore High Court, Lahore, declined his request. An FIR (No. 309/2023) was lodged against him on January 15, 2023, at Police Station Nishtar Colony, Lahore, under sections 448, 440, 511, 427, 148, 149, PPC. The FIR alleged that on the said date, the petitioner and co-accused, armed with firearms, forcibly entered the housing society of the complainant, fired indiscriminately, injuring a passerby, and damaging property including the gate and building of the office. ----Issues: Whether the petitioner was falsely implicated in the FIR due to mala fide intentions and ulterior motives. Whether the presence of family conflicts and cross-versions of the incident warranted the granting of pre-arrest bail. Whether the lack of police investigation into the alleged injury of a passerby raised further questions about the petitioner\u2019s guilt. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: False Implication and Family Conflicts: The court recognized the ongoing family conflicts over the ownership and management of the Formanites Housing Society, founded by the petitioner\u2019s late father. Given the potential for malafide intentions and false implications arising from these disputes, the court found merit in the petitioner\u2019s claim of being falsely implicated. Cross-Versions and Further Inquiry: The court noted that in cases of cross-versions arising from the same incident, bail is typically granted to allow further inquiry. The petitioner alleged that the complainant party was the aggressor, which required a detailed investigation to ascertain the truth. Precedents cited included Fazal Muhammad (1976 SCMR 391), Shafiq-ur-Rehman (1972 SCMR 682), and Khalid Mahmood (2013 SCMR 1415). Lack of Investigation into Injury: The FIR mentioned an injury to passerby Zeeshan Haider due to the firing, but the police conducted no investigation into this injury. This omission raised further doubts about the prosecution\u2019s case, leading the court to classify the matter as one requiring further inquiry. ----Outcome: The Supreme Court converted the petition into an appeal and allowed it. The impugned order of the Lahore High Court dated November 13, 2023, was set aside. The petitioner was granted pre-arrest bail upon furnishing surety bonds of Rs. 100,000 and a personal recognizance bond of the same amount. The court emphasized that these observations were tentative and that the trial court was free to adjudicate the case independently based on its merits. -----Citations/Precedents: Fazal Muhammad (1976 SCMR 391) Shafiq-ur-Rehman (1972 SCMR 682) Khalid Mahmood (2013 SCMR 1415) ----Notes: The case highlights the importance of a thorough investigation, especially when there are cross-versions and potential false implications due to family disputes. The decision underscores the principle that bail should be granted in cases requiring further inquiry.",

The court ordered the implementation of the recommendations provided by the Commissioner who inspected the hospital's premises. A compliance report is to be submitted by the official respondents before the next hearing. The court observed that medical facilities, particularly in rural areas of Sindh Province, have significantly deteriorated, violating Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The court suggested a policy where government representatives and their family members should seek medical treatment from hospitals in their constituencies unless specialized treatment is required. This aims to ensure better medical facilities for all citizens.",

The motive was related to a family dispute over the appellant's divorce from the deceased's daughter. Trial and Evidence: The appellant was charged and tried, with the prosecution presenting eight witnesses. The complainant, Raheem Khan, and an eyewitness provided accounts of the incident. The investigation included collecting blood-stained earth and .30 bore empties from the scene, which were confirmed by a firearms expert to have been fired from one weapon. Defense and Absence of Contradiction: The appellant denied guilt but did not present evidence in his defense. The court found the prosecution witnesses credible, noting the absence of contradictions in their statements and the support from medical evidence aligning with the ocular account. Motive and Relationship: The court recognized the established relationship and motive due to the family dispute. The appellant's abscondance following the incident was considered supportive of the prosecution's case. Judicial Reasoning: The trial court's judgment was based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence, which was found to be free of irregularities or defects warranting interference. ----Citations/Precedents: Abdul Latif vs. Noor Taman and another (2021 SCMR 1428): Highlighted the reliability of related witnesses. Ghafar Ali vs. The State and another (2021 SCMR 354): Addressed prompt reporting of the incident.

Imran Mehmood vs. The State and another (2023 SCMR 795): Discussed the rarity of false implication in cases involving single accused. ----Conclusion: Criminal Appeal: The court dismissed the criminal appeal, affirming the life imprisonment sentence. The prosecution's evidence was deemed credible, and the trial court's judgment was upheld. Criminal Revision: The court also dismissed the criminal revision for enhancing the sentence to the death penalty, citing the unclear motive and circumstances leading to the killing. The trial court's decision to award life imprisonment was considered justified. Outcome: Both the criminal appeal and the criminal revision were dismissed, and the trial court's judgment was upheld without any changes.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, Haji Saif-ur-Rahman Shaheen, challenged the decree of Khula (dissolution of marriage) granted by the Family Judge, Jhang, on 18.05.2022, under Section 10(5) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (Amended 2015). The petitioner also sought the invalidation of this judgment and a subsequent writ petition dismissal by the Lahore High Court on 20.09.2022. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court's decree of Khula under Section 10(5) was valid, given the section was declared against Islamic injunctions. 2- Whether Khula is an absolute right of a woman in Islam, and what are the necessary requirements to obtain it. 3- Whether a Judge can grant Khula when demanded by a wife without the husband's consent. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Invalidation of Section 10(5): Section 10(5) of the Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015, had already been declared against the injunctions of Islam by the Federal Shariat Court in its judgment dated 17.02.2022 (PLD 2022 FSC 25). The Family Court, Jhang's decree on 18.05.2022, was thus based on an ineffective provision. --Absolute Right of Khula: Khula is a fundamental right granted to women by Islam, based on the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. A woman can claim a decree for Khula from a court of law by stating her dislike for her husband and her inability to live with him within the limits prescribed by Allah. This does not require proving maltreatment or mistreatment. --Judicial Grant of Khula: The court can grant Khula if a wife demands it and is willing to return her Mahar (dower). The court must grant the decree without delay if the wife expresses her intent to return the Mahar in exchange for Khula. Additionally, if the wife claims ill-treatment, the court can adjust the amount of compensation based on the circumstances. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine as it sought an in-personam relief, which is outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court. The judgment highlighted that the decree of Khula granted by the Family Court was based on an invalid provision, reinforcing that the right of Khula is an absolute right of a woman in Islam. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2022 FSC 25 (Imran Anwar Khan v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: In Shariat Petition No. 11-I/2022, the petitioner challenged Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, arguing that it allows Khula (dissolution of marriage initiated by the wife) without the husband's consent, which he claimed is against Islamic injunctions. The petitioner sought to have this section declared un-Islamic and void, and to have the law amended to require the husband's consent for Khula. ----Issues: 1- Whether Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, allowing Khula without the husband's consent, is against Islamic injunctions. 2- Whether the Family Court's decision granting Khula to the petitioner's wife without his consent is valid under Islamic law. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Validity of Section 10(4): The Full Bench of the Federal Shariat Court in \u201cSaleem Ahmad and others v. Government of Pakistan and others\u201d (PLD 2014 FSC 43) had already addressed the issue. It was held that courts of competent jurisdiction could decree Khula when reconciliation fails, even without the husband's consent. This decision affirms that Section 10(4) does not violate Islamic injunctions. --Judicial Authority to Grant Khula: The court emphasized that the judiciary has the authority to dissolve marriages, including Khula, if reconciliation fails. This authority is supported by Islamic principles, as courts are established to resolve disputes, including those involving marriage dissolution. --Legal Effect of Khula: The court reiterated that Khula operates as a single irrevocable divorce, allowing both parties to remarry each other without an intermediary marriage, unlike in the case of a triple talaq where halala (intermediary marriage) is required. The court noted that Iddat (waiting period) applies to the wife if she wishes to remarry after Khula. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine, as the court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments. The court upheld the earlier judgment of the Full Bench and confirmed that Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, allowing Khula without the husband's consent, is consistent with Islamic law. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2014 FSC 43 (Saleem Ahmad and others v.

The petitioners also requested the court to ensure that parents of deceased civil servants automatically receive their due share of pension and other emoluments. ----Issues: 1- Whether pensionary benefits of a deceased person fall within the definition of \"Tarka\" (inheritance) under Islamic law. 2- Whether the Federal Shariat Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioners. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Definition of \"Tarka\": The court reiterated that pensionary benefits do not fall within the definition of \"Tarka\" and are governed by the departmental Pensionary Rules. The court noted that for the purpose of pensionary benefits, the employer is at liberty to define the family. Pensionary benefits are not subject to inheritance laws but are governed by specific rules laid out by the employer. --Jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court: The court emphasized that a Shariat Petition under Article 203-D of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, requires the petitioner to identify a specific law or rule that is against the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah. The petitioners failed to identify any such law or rule. The relief sought by the petitioners was in personam (individual relief), which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court. The court's jurisdiction is limited to examining whether laws or rules are in accordance with Islamic injunctions, not to grant specific individual relief. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine due to lack of maintainability. The court found that pensionary benefits do not constitute \"Tarka\" and are not subject to inheritance laws. Additionally, the petitioners failed to meet the constitutional requirement of identifying any law or rule against the injunctions of Islam. The court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioners. ----Citations/Precedents: \"Federation of Pakistan v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners filed a Shariat Petition challenging Section 346 of the Muhammadan Law, which pertains to the adoption of a son. The core issue revolves around whether the adoption of a child in Islam permits the change of the child's family name, as the petitioners argue that adoption does not alter the child's relationship with their biological parents and siblings. ----Issues: 1- Whether the adoption of a child in Islam allows for changing the child's family name. 2- Whether the orders passed by the courts below, including the Lahore High Court, were erroneous and against the injunctions of Islam. 3- Whether the petition falls within the scope of a Shariat Petition under Article 203B(c) of the Constitution of Pakistan. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the Shariat Petition on the following grounds: The petitioners were seeking personal relief regarding the change of surname for an adopted child, which is beyond the scope of a Shariat Petition. The Court observed that the petitioners were involved in litigation before different fora concerning the change of surname of an adopted child. The Lahore High Court had already decided the matter in a related case (W.P. No.59749/2021), dismissing the petition based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Mst. Laila Qayyum v. Fawad Qayum (PLD 2019 SC 449). The Court reaffirmed that the \"Principles of Muhammadan Law\" authored by Dinshah Fardunji Mullah is only a reference book without the force of law and does not fall under the ambit of law as provided under Article 203-B(c) of the Constitution. The petition was deemed not maintainable under Clause (c) of Article 203B of the Constitution, as the Court had previously addressed the matter in the case of M/s Najaat Welfare Foundation v. Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2021 FSC 1). ----Citations/Precedents: Mst. Laila Qayyum v. Fawad Qayum and others (PLD 2019 SC 449) M/s Najaat Welfare Foundation v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A Shariat Petition was filed challenging Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, questioning its conformity with Islamic injunctions. The petitioner raised ten questions regarding various aspects of Islamic law, focusing on the right of a Muslim woman to seek Khula (dissolution of marriage) and the legal implications of such actions under Islamic jurisprudence. ----Issues: 1- Whether Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam concerning the process of Khula. 2- Whether the questions raised by the petitioner are relevant and substantial for the Federal Shariat Court's consideration. 3- Whether the procedural requirements of filing a Shariat Petition were met by the petitioner. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petition was dismissed in limine (at the outset) as it was deemed not maintainable. The court identified that the petitioner failed to adhere to the procedural requirements set by the Federal Shariat Court (Procedure) Rules, 1981. Specifically, the petition did not properly describe the law considered repugnant, nor did it provide relevant Quranic verses or Hadiths to support the claims. Additionally, the court found that the questions raised were largely irrelevant, ambiguous, and did not directly pertain to any actionable legal provisions. The court also noted that Section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act had already been reviewed in a previous case (PLD 2014 FSC 43), with an appeal pending before the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The petition was dismissed due to non-compliance with procedural rules and lack of substantive legal grounds. -----Citations/Precedents: Saleem Ahmad and others vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2014 FSC 43).",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellants were convicted and sentenced under Section 396 PPC by the IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Hyderabad, for their involvement in a robbery and murder that took place on July 17, 2006. The appellants Fida Hussain, Makhan, and Muhammad Hassan were awarded death and life imprisonment sentences, while Muhammad Ali received a lesser sentence. The prosecution alleged that the appellants, along with others, robbed the complainant\u2019s house, during which the complainant\u2019s son was fatally shot. The appellants were arrested during a police encounter, and the prosecution claimed recovery of stolen items from their possession. ----Issues: 1- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR affects the prosecution's case. 2- Whether the identification parade and the identification of the accused by the witnesses were reliable. 3- Whether the recovery of stolen items from the accused was legitimate and could be used as evidence against them. 4- Whether the contradictions in witness statements and the lack of eyewitness testimony weaken the prosecution's case. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delay in FIR: The court noted the significant delay of five days in lodging the FIR without any plausible explanation. This delay, combined with the complainant's admission of consulting with family before filing the report, raised serious doubts about the authenticity of the prosecution's story. --Identification Parade: The identification of the accused was deemed unreliable. The accused were allegedly masked during the incident, and no specific description was provided in the FIR. The identification parade was held 12 days after the arrest, with no explanation for the delay. The court found this to be highly suspicious and doubted the validity of the identification. --Recovery of Stolen Items: The court questioned the legitimacy of the recovery process. The items were allegedly found after an encounter, but no independent witnesses were involved, which is a violation of Section 103 Cr.P.C. The prosecution's claim that the accused were carrying the stolen items for over a month after the incident was also considered implausible. --Contradictions and Lack of Eyewitness Testimony: The court highlighted contradictions in the statements of the complainant and his wife regarding key details. Additionally, the prosecution failed to produce the only eyewitness, Mst. Saba, who was present during the murder. The absence of independent witnesses and the discrepancies in the testimonies weakened the prosecution's case significantly. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The benefit of the doubt was extended to the appellants, leading to their acquittal. The murder reference was answered in the negative, and the appellants were ordered to be released. ----Citations/Precedents: Ahmed Sher v. State (PLD 1995 FSC 20) Muhammad Fayyaz v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petition was filed challenging the amendment to Section 497 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which grants bail concessions exclusively to women accused of certain offenses. The petitioner argued that this amendment is discriminatory, violating the principles of equality and justice as outlined in Islamic law and the Constitution of Pakistan. The petitioner claimed that the law unfairly discriminates against male accused, depriving them of similar bail rights. ----Issues: 1- Does the amendment to Section 497 Cr.P.C., which provides bail concessions only to women accused, violate the principles of equality and justice as per Islamic law? 2- Is the amendment in conflict with Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guarantees equality before the law? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Jurisdiction and Constitutional Matters: The court noted that it does not have the jurisdiction to interpret Article 25 of the Constitution, as this falls within the exclusive domain of the Supreme Court. However, the court referenced the Supreme Court's decision, which permits reasonable classification based on gender, financial status, or other distinctions that serve a legitimate purpose. --Islamic Perspective: The court evaluated the petition in light of Islamic principles, noting that while equality is fundamental, it does not necessarily mean identical treatment in all circumstances. Islamic teachings recognize different roles and responsibilities for men and women, justifying legal distinctions such as those in Section 497 Cr.P.C. --Social Responsibilities of Women: The court emphasized that women\u2019s unique social roles, particularly in child-rearing and family care, warrant special legal concessions. These distinctions are not discriminatory but rather an acknowledgment of the different circumstances faced by women. The court dismissed the petition, holding that the amendment to Section 497 Cr.P.C. is consistent with both the Constitution and Islamic principles. The bail concession for women accused was upheld as legitimate and non-discriminatory. ----Citations/Precedents: Government of Balochistan Vs.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Conviction upheld----Background: The appellants were convicted by the Sessions Judge/Zillah Qazi Malakand at Batkhela for multiple offenses, including dacoity and rape, and sentenced to life imprisonment under Sections 395, 376, and 457 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The charges stemmed from an incident on 22-04-2012, where the appellants, along with four other unidentified individuals, allegedly entered the complainant's home at night, tied up the family members, looted valuables, and raped the complainant's niece, Mst. Neelam. ----Issues: 1- Whether the prosecution sufficiently proved the involvement of the appellants in the offenses of dacoity and rape. 2- Whether the lack of an identification parade, absence of specific role assignment, and non-recovery of stolen articles from one of the appellants could undermine the conviction. 3- Whether the trial court's enhancement of the sentence under Section 457 PPC from 5 to 10 years was justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Prosecution's Proof of Involvement: The court held that the prosecution had adequately proven the appellants' involvement in the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The FIR was lodged promptly, and the complainant's testimony, along with the consistent statements of other witnesses, including the victim, Mst. Neelam, corroborated the charges of dacoity and rape. The medical evidence and chemical examiner's report further supported the prosecution's case. --Lack of Identification Parade and Role Assignment: The court dismissed the appellants' arguments regarding the lack of an identification parade, noting that the appellants were named in the FIR, which was filed shortly after the incident. The court also found that the failure to assign specific roles to each accused did not weaken the prosecution's case, as the involvement of the appellants in the offenses was clearly established. --Non-Recovery of Stolen Articles: The court noted that the appellants were arrested three months after the incident, providing them ample time to dispose of the stolen articles. The minimal recovery from Zakirullah and the lack of recovery from Fazal Aziz did not create sufficient doubt to overturn the convictions. --Enhancement of Sentence under Section 457 PPC: The court found that the trial court was justified in enhancing the sentence under Section 457 PPC to 10 years, given the seriousness of the offenses committed during the night. The appeals were dismissed, and the convictions and sentences, including the enhanced sentence under Section 457 PPC, were upheld. The court also ordered that all sentences should run concurrently and extended the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. to the appellants for all sentences. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 1967 Dacca 528: The court referred to this precedent to emphasize that the number of culprits involved in the offense is determined by the evidence and not by the number of persons convicted. PLD 2003 Karachi 470: Reinforced that an identification parade is not mandatory if the accused are named in a promptly lodged FIR. The court concluded that the prosecution had met its burden of proof, leading to the dismissal of the appeals and the affirmation of the trial court's judgments.",

The petitioner had previously unsuccessfully challenged his ex-wife's exercise of this right in the High Court and the Supreme Court before bringing the matter to the Federal Shariat Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the right of divorce (Talaq) can be delegated to the wife under Islamic law. 2- Whether the process outlined in Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, is consistent with Islamic injunctions. 3- Whether the terminology and procedural requirements in the ordinance are appropriate and in line with Shariah. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delegation of Divorce (Talaq-e-Tafweez): The court held that the delegation of the right to pronounce Talaq to the wife (Talaq-e-Tafweez) is permissible under Islamic law. This delegation serves as a safeguard for women in cases where the husband is cruel, neglects his duties, or is absent for long periods. The court noted that this practice has been accepted by the majority of Sunni Muslim jurists and is recognized in Islamic jurisprudence. --Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: The court acknowledged that the ordinance was enacted following the recommendations of a commission that recognized the legality of Talaq-e-Tafweez. The court found no contradiction between Section 8 and the injunctions of Islam, as the ordinance simply codifies a practice already accepted by Islamic jurists. --Jurisdictional Limitation: The court concluded that since the issue pertains to Muslim Personal Law\u2014a category exempt from the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court\u2014the petition was not maintainable. The court referred to a precedent that established the limitation of the court\u2019s jurisdiction in matters that are deeply rooted in the personal law of any Muslim sect. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 1994 SC 619: This case discussed the scope of the Federal Shariat Court\u2019s jurisdiction concerning Muslim Personal Law and was cited to justify the court's refusal to entertain the petition based on jurisdictional grounds.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the respondents, under Section 10(2) of the Offences of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. The appellant claimed that Mst. Masahiba Khan, who he alleged to be his legally wedded wife, had contracted a second marriage with Shahbaz Ahmed Khan, thereby committing the offense of Zina. ----Issues: 1- Whether the marriage between the appellant, Abdullah, and Mst. Masahiba Khan was valid and legally recognized. 2- Whether the marriage between the respondents, Shahbaz Ahmed Khan and Mst. Masahiba Khan, was lawful or constituted an act of Zina under the law. 3- Whether the trial court's acquittal of the respondents was justified given the circumstances and evidence presented. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Validity of Marriage Between Abdullah and Mst. Masahiba Khan: The court held that the marriage between Abdullah and Mst. Masahiba Khan was not legally recognized. The Family Court had already decreed in favor of Mst. Masahiba Khan in her suit for jactitation of marriage, declaring that no valid marriage existed between her and Abdullah. This decree was upheld by the District Judge and later by the Sindh High Court, thus nullifying any claims Abdullah had regarding the marriage. --Marriage Between Respondents: The court determined that the marriage between Shahbaz Ahmed Khan and Mst. Masahiba Khan was lawful. The acknowledgment of the marriage by both respondents during their statements before the trial court was considered sufficient evidence of a valid marriage under Muslim law. The court referenced the legal principle that acknowledgment by the man of the woman as his wife is sufficient proof of a valid marriage. The court found no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to acquit the respondents. Given the conclusive findings of the Family Court and the acknowledgment of marriage by the respondents, the court ruled that the acquittal was appropriate. The appeal was dismissed in limine. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v. Muhammad Iqbal (PLD 1984 SC 95): The Supreme Court held that a decree passed by a Family Court is binding even upon the Supreme Court, emphasizing the finality and binding nature of such decrees. Abdul Waheed v. Asma Jehangir (PLD 2004 SC 219): The Supreme Court held that questions of marriage validity fall within the exclusive domain of Family Courts, reinforcing the binding nature of Family Court judgments on such matters. Para 268(c) of Muhammadan Law by Mullah: This principle was cited to support the notion that acknowledgment of marriage by the parties involved is sufficient proof of a valid marriage under Muslim law.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants were convicted under Section 500 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to fines and imprisonment for defaming the complainant, who was their former husband (in the case of two appellants). The complainant alleged that the appellants had falsely accused him of zina (adultery) in legal proceedings and in applications submitted to higher authorities. The trial court acquitted some of the accused but convicted the appellants for defamation. The complainant appealed for their conviction under the Offence of Qazf (false accusation of adultery) and sought an enhancement of their sentences. ----Issues: 1- Whether the appellants\u2019 statements constituted defamation under Section 500 PPC. 2- Whether the appellants\u2019 actions amounted to Qazf under the Qazf (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. 3- Whether the trial court\u2019s conviction of the appellants under Section 500 PPC was legally justified. 4- Whether the appellants acted with malicious intent or in good faith. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Defamation (Section 500 PPC): The court found that the essential element of defamation is mens rea or intent to harm. It determined that the appellants acted in good faith to protect their rights rather than with the intent to harm the complainant's reputation. Therefore, their actions fell under the exceptions provided in Section 499 PPC, leading to the setting aside of their conviction under Section 500 PPC. --Qazf (Offence of False Accusation of Zina): The court concluded that the appellants did not commit Qazf, as their statements did not unambiguously accuse the complainant of zina. It emphasized that the required evidence for imposing Hadd punishment, such as a confession or the testimony of two witnesses fulfilling the requirement of Tazkiyah-al-Shahood, was not present. --Lack of Malicious Intent: The court found no evidence of malicious intent, recognizing that the appellants\u2019 actions were driven by a desire to assert their rights. Consequently, the trial court's conviction was not legally justified. --Acquittal of Other Accused and Dismissal of Appeals: The court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to acquit the other accused, finding no grounds for conviction. The appeals seeking enhancement of the appellants\u2019 sentences and the reversal of the acquittals of other accused were dismissed. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v. Muhammad Iqbal (PLD 1984 SC 95) \u2013 Held that the decree passed by the Family Court is binding even upon the Supreme Court. Abdul Waheed v. Asma Jehangir (PLD 2004 SC 219) \u2013 Held that the validity of a marriage falls within the exclusive domain of the Family Court, and the High Court should avoid controversy on this subject. PLD 2001-Karachi-115 \u2013 Emphasized that intent (mens rea) is a crucial element for constituting the offense of defamation.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellant, a father, filed a criminal appeal against the acquittal of the respondents by the Additional Sessions Judge, Kabirwala, District Khanewal. The case revolves around the death of the appellant's daughter, who was found dead near a railway track under suspicious circumstances. Initially, the death was reported as a possible suicide after being run over by a train. The appellant, dissatisfied with the police investigation, filed a private complaint alleging that the respondents were responsible for the rape and murder of his daughter. ----Issues: 1- Whether the evidence presented by the appellant was sufficient to establish the guilt of the respondents beyond a reasonable doubt. 2- Whether the respondents were involved in the abduction, rape, and murder of the appellant's daughter. 3- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting the respondents of all charges. 4- Whether the circumstantial evidence provided by the prosecution was sufficient to overturn the acquittal. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Sufficiency of Evidence: The court held that the evidence provided by the appellant was largely circumstantial and failed to establish a direct connection between the respondents and the crime. The court noted inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's narrative, which led to doubts about the reliability of the evidence. --Abduction, Rape, and Murder Allegations: The court found that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, including the last-seen theory and extra-judicial confessions. The court emphasized that such evidence must be corroborated by strong, consistent facts, which were lacking in this case. The medical evidence also did not conclusively support the allegations of rape. --Trial Court\u2019s Decision: The appellate court agreed with the trial court's assessment that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reiterated that in criminal cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused. --Circumstantial Evidence: The court held that while circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for conviction, it must form a complete chain that leads to only one conclusion: the guilt of the accused. In this case, the chain of evidence was broken, and the circumstances presented by the prosecution did not conclusively point to the respondents' guilt. As a result, the appeal was dismissed, and the respondents' acquittal was upheld. However, the court noted that the case against the absconding accused would be considered separately upon his arrest. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted. --- This case involves an appeal in the Lahore High Court against convictions under sections 302, 460, and 411 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The appellants were convicted for the deaths of two individuals, found under suspicious circumstances in their residence. The initial report was lodged by a family member who discovered the victims after failing to make contact and became suspicious of foul play. The trial court convicted the appellants based on circumstantial evidence including DNA and fingerprint matches. -----Issues: 1. Whether the circumstantial evidence, including forensic evidence, was sufficient to uphold the convictions. 2. Whether procedural lapses in handling forensic evidence compromised its reliability and the integrity of the judicial process. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Lahore High Court overturned the convictions and acquitted the appellants, identifying critical procedural errors and the insufficient linking of the appellants to the crime through the evidence provided. Key issues highlighted included: The improper handling and preservation of forensic evidence which cast doubts on its authenticity and reliability. The unreliability of witness testimonies and the failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence directly implicating the appellants. The lack of direct evidence and inconsistencies in the procedural conduct of the investigation and subsequent forensic analysis. The court emphasized the necessity of strict adherence to procedural norms in the collection and analysis of forensic evidence in criminal cases. ----Citations/Precedents: Gul Muhammad and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, filed a writ petition challenging the order dated March 27, 2014, passed by Judge Family Court-West, Islamabad. This order dismissed the petitioner\u2019s objection to the maintainability of a family suit filed by respondent No.2, who claimed to be his wife and sought dissolution of marriage. The petitioner denied the existence of a marriage contract and argued that the suit did not fall within the Family Court's jurisdiction. -----Issues: Whether the Family Court has jurisdiction to decide a case where the existence of the matrimonial relationship is denied. Whether the appropriate forum for resolving disputes about the matrimonial status is the Civil Court or the Family Court. The impact of an existing marriage of the respondent with another individual on the jurisdiction and proceedings of the Family Court. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Islamabad High Court dismissed the petition in limine, upholding the Family Court's jurisdiction to decide the case. The Court provided the following reasoning: Section 5 of the Family Court Act, 1964 grants exclusive jurisdiction to Family Courts to entertain and adjudicate matters specified in Part I of the Schedule, which includes jactitation of marriage. Jactitation of marriage, where one spouse denies the existence of a marriage, falls within the exclusive domain of the Family Court. Abdul Waheed vs. Asma Jehangir [PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219]: The Supreme Court held that the validity of a marriage is within the exclusive domain of the Family Court, and High Courts should avoid creating controversies on this subject. Abdul Hamid vs. Munaza Fakhar [2006 YLR 2622 Lahore]: It was established that disputes about the existence of marital relations between spouses fall under the Family Court's jurisdiction, while similar disputes raised by third parties fall under Civil Court jurisdiction. The petitioner cited cases involving inheritance disputes and third-party challenges to marital status. These precedents were distinguished as they did not pertain to direct disputes between spouses. The Court concluded that the Family Court correctly assumed jurisdiction over the matter as it involved a direct dispute between alleged spouses regarding the existence of their marriage. Consequently, the petition challenging the Family Court's order was dismissed. -----Citations/Precedents: MST Jameela Akhtar vs. Public at Large [2002 SCMR 1544] Abdul Waheed vs. Asma Jehangir [PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219] Abdul Hamid vs. Munaza Fakhar [2006 YLR 2622 Lahore] Unreported Supreme Court Judgment in Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Petitioner No. 1) and Respondent No. 2 were married on 9th November 2010 and had a child, born on 19th August 2011. After Respondent No. 2 contracted a second marriage, Nosheen Agha filed for maintenance for herself and her daughter. The Family Judge initially set interim maintenance at Rs. 15,000 per month, but Respondent No. 2 failed to pay. Consequently, the Family Court struck off Respondent No. 2\u2019s defense and decreed maintenance at Rs. 1,50,000 per month from August 2011. Respondent No. 2 appealed, resulting in the reduction of maintenance to Rs. 15,000 per month with a 15% annual increase. -----Issues: Whether the appellate court erred in reducing the quantum of maintenance without proper reasoning and consideration of statutory provisions. Whether the trial court\u2019s decision to strike off Respondent No. 2\u2019s defense and decree the suit was justified based on the respondent\u2019s failure to pay interim maintenance. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Islamabad High Court set aside the appellate judgment and restored the trial court's decision to strike off Respondent No. 2's defense. The case was remanded to the trial court to reassess the quantum of maintenance after evaluating the financial status of Respondent No. 2. The court found that both the trial and appellate courts failed to properly assess the financial status of Respondent No. 2 and the needs of the minor child. It emphasized that decreeing a suit requires judicial determination based on evidence and law. The appellate court\u2019s reduction of maintenance was deemed unwarranted as it did not consider these factors. The appellate judgment was set aside, and the case was remanded to the trial court for reassessment. The trial court was directed to resolve the matter within one month, with each party bearing their own costs. -----Citations/Precedents: Messrs A.R.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner and respondent, who are spouses, married on December 2, 1999. They had a son on November 1, 2000. Following family disputes, both parties approached the Family Court. The wife filed a suit for dissolution of marriage, recovery of dowry articles, maintenance allowance, and custody of the minor. The Family Court framed five issues and, after evidence and arguments, delivered a judgment on July 23, 2008. ----Issues: Whether the petitioner was denied the right of cross-examination. Whether the petitioner is entitled to custody of the minor given the minor's age. Whether the maintenance allowance should be reduced or adjusted. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petitioner's claim about the denial of cross-examination rights was dismissed based on a previous court decision on June 18, 2008, which ruled that allowing every Family Court order to be challenged via writ petition would abuse constitutional jurisdiction. The court emphasized the minor's welfare and the petitioner\u2019s remarriage, deciding it was not in the minor's best interest to be under the care of a stepmother, while the father is often absent due to work. The father's conduct and insufficient maintenance provision disqualified him from custody. The court affirmed the maintenance allowance adjustment to Rs. 2,000 per month as reasonable given the circumstances. The petition was dismissed for lack of merit, with no costs imposed. ----Citations/Precedents: 2007 SCMR 621 1994 CLC 1216 Lahore 1994 CLC 1242 Karachi PLD 1988 Karachi 252 PLD 1988 Karachi 261 1995 CLC 800 Lahore 1995 CLC 813 Lahore 1991 MLD 745 Lahore 1991 MLD 756 Lahore 2000 SCMR 838",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petitioner sought a declaration against the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and Additional District Judge, Islamabad, which were deemed illegal and without lawful authority. The petitioner, married on January 20, 1995, claimed dowry articles, gold ornaments (19 tolas), possession of a house, and maintenance allowance as stipulated in the Nikahnama. The Family Court partially decreed the suit, and the petitioner appealed, which was dismissed. ----Issues: Whether the solitary statement of the wife is sufficient to prove the claim for dowry articles. Whether the petitioner is required to prove the claim for dowry articles in terms of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Whether the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and Additional District Judge were lawful and based on a proper appreciation of the evidence. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the solitary statement of the wife is sufficient to prove the claim for dowry articles. This stance is supported by previous judgments which affirm that the wife\u2019s testimony alone can substantiate such claims. The requirement for proof in terms of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, was deemed inapplicable in this case due to Section 17(1) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which excludes the application of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order in Family Court proceedings. The court noted that it is impractical and against societal norms for brides to keep purchase receipts or to prepare and have a dowry list signed by the husband's side. The cultural context and traditions support the acceptance of the wife\u2019s testimony regarding dowry articles. Consequently, the constitutional petition was allowed. The judgments of the Family Court and Additional District Judge were set aside, and the petitioner was awarded Rs.150,000 as the value of dowry articles, accounting for depreciation. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Jaffar v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Respondent Gul Bad Shah initially filed a suit for declaration that he had sold land to the appellants' family members, but they had not paid the full amount. The trial court consolidated all the suits and allowed an expert opinion regarding thumbprint identification on a disputed document. The trial court dismissed Gul Bad Shah's suit and decreed the appellants' suits. The respondents appealed, and the appellate court focused on the evidentiary value of the expert opinion, concluding that it was not conclusive evidence. The petitioner in this document argues that both parties had agreed to consider the expert opinion as binding, creating a procedural agreement. The petitioner refers to the principle of estoppel and argues that Gul Bad Shah cannot change his position after the expert report confirmed his thumbprint. The petitioner contends that the appellate court failed to appreciate this aspect and sets aside the appellate judgment, restoring the trial court's judgment and decree.",

They were sentenced to life imprisonment and also fined Rs. 200,000 each, with a default sentence of two years' imprisonment in case of non-payment of the fine. According to the (FIR) registered by the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), the appellants were stopped and checked at a picket near Motorway Tool Plaza Peshawar. The ANF officials found narcotics in their vehicle and arrested them. The prosecution produced evidence, including samples of the recovered contraband and reports from the Chemical Examiner, to support its case. During the trial, the appellants claimed that they were innocent and had come to Peshawar for a family event. They argued that they had no knowledge of the narcotics found in the vehicle. However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be overwhelming and sufficient to prove the appellants' guilt. The court upheld the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the appellants. The appeal was dismissed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioners, who are the legal representatives of Nazir Ahmad, a deceased civil servant, filed the Constitutional Petition seeking to set aside the order of removal of their predecessor from service and claiming back benefits, financial benefits, pension gratuity, and past salary. The central issue of the case was whether the legal action, challenging the removal of a civil servant from service, survives upon the death of the petitioner during the proceedings. The court ruled that if the right to sue is not intrinsically connected with the individuality of the deceased petitioner and the right to relief or benefit sought can be inherited by the legal heirs, then the legal action does not abate. It was found that the Education Department was aware of the deceased's medical condition. Therefore, the court concluded that the death of the predecessor would not abate the cause of action for the legal representatives to challenge the order of removal and claim pensionary benefits. The court noted that the Service Tribunal had limited jurisdiction and could not entertain a petition from the family or legal representatives of the deceased civil servant. Since there was no other forum available for the legal representatives to seek relief, the court asserted its constitutional jurisdiction and set aside the impugned order of removal. The case was remanded to the Chief Secretary, for reconsideration of the reasons for the predecessor's absence and to pass an appropriate order relating to the grant of pension to the present petitioners within one month from the date of the judgment.",

In this regard reference is made to section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869.(iii) The Court can grant a decree for a judicial, separation within the meaning of section 22 of the Divorce Act, 1869 or to dissolve the marriage under section 10 of the same Act.(The writ petition was allowed in the circumstances)",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Obviously, in the event of indiscriminate firing by six persons simultaneously, it is absolutely impossible for a victim to note with exactitude that whose fire hits him on a particular part of his body. Surprisingly, it is the complainant who has performed such miracle by differentiating roles of accused/respondents in the commission of offence and that too when he received injuries on his hips. As per medical evidence, the injured complainant was fired at from back side in view of the locale of injuries. In such circumstances, surely no one can take notice of firing being made from behind him.The story narrated by the complainant in his report suggests that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and manner as alleged by him. There is something which was suppressed by the complainant in order to rope in falsely various persons of the same family by ascribing them different roles in the commission of the offence. Thus, the statement of the injured complainant in the circumstances of the case does not ring truth. Mere stamp of injuries on the person of a witness would not be a proof of the fact that whatever he deposes would be the truthful account of the events. His veracity is to be tested from the circumstances of the case and his own statement whether it fits in the circumstances of the case or otherwise. Appeal against acquittal dismissed in limine.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Perusal of the record reveals that the learned trial Court while passing the impugned order, has referred to Section 21-A of West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 which provides that a family Court may pass an interim order to preserve and protect any property in dispute.It is clear that these provisions are discretionary, however, such discretion was structured/limited by the subsequent words any property in dispute . The petitioner/husband in his reply to application for sealing of the dowry articles very frankly expressed his willingness to hand over the dowry articles lying in his house to the respondent/wife. Thus, there remained no the point of disagreement or dispute over the dowry articles lying in husband s house, and as such, in the absence any property in dispute, the scope of discretion of the Family Court under section 21-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, vanished.Under section 21-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964, a family court has not been vested with powers to issue direction for any kind of sealing rather the words preserve and protect have been used in this section. The dictionary meaning of PRESERVE are to maintain (something) in its original or existing state or to keep safe from injury, harm, or destruction. Whereas, dictionary meaning of PROTECT are to keep safe from harm or injury or to cover or shield from exposure, injury, damage, or destruction.Family Court has illegally prevented the petitioner and inmates of his house to use the said rooms of their own house which by itself is violative of the provisions of Article 24(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. In-fact learned family court has passed the order to seal the rooms of the house of petitioner/husband which were not the subject matter of the family suit.",

Every criminal case has a sad story to tell and that the attending circumstancesof the cases shocks one's mind to the extreme, but this alone cannot be considered adetermining factor to determine the fate of the parties involved. If on one hand, thefamilies of those who lose their lives are the worst sufferers, then on the other, theaccused charged and his family is also expecting fair trial from the courts of law.II). Once the Court comes to a conclusion that the number of accused is exaggerated and once it forms an opinion from the attending circumstances of a particular case that the act committed was the doing of a limited number of accused then the exaggerated charge brought by the complainant will react upon the veracity and authenticity of the collected material and recorded statements.III). Though, medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and in presence of trustworthyand confidence inspiring eye witness account, it cannot overshadow the same, but in case where the eye witness account fails to convince on a particular aspect of the case, then the conflict between the two would creep down to the roots. As in the present case, the testimony of the complainant regarding the mode, manner and the number of accused charged does not convince the judicial mind of this Court: so this Court lurks no doubt in mind that the conflict between the ocular account and the medical evidence has damaged the prosecution case beyond repair.IV). Since immemorial, it has been held that beffer to acquit ten culprits than to convictan innocent soul. Both the English Jurisprudence as well as our religion are inconsonance on this particular aspect of acquittal and conviction. We went through therelevant record as keen observers, but could not lay hands on any concrete evidencewhich could convince that all the accused charged are responsible for the deaths of thedeceased and injury to the complainant. When a stage comes, where it becomesimpossible that who, out of the accused charged, committed the offence, then the courtsare Left with limited option to fix the liability and in such eventuality, the benefit of thesame is always extended to all the accused charged.(Criminal appeal allowed)",

The legal framework involved included the Succession Act, 1925, among other laws and international legal principles.The deceased, Tahir Ahmed Khan, left behind an estate comprising both movable and immovable properties, including bank accounts in Pakistan and properties in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The court noted that all legal heirs, including the petitioner, were the deceased's children, and the deceased's former wife was not a legal heir due to a prior divorce recognized by the relevant authority.The application process included the submission of necessary documents such as the death certificate, family registration, and affidavits from independent witnesses. Notices were published in widely circulated newspapers, and no adverse claims were filed against the estate. The court discussed the maintainability of the petition, referencing a Supreme Court judgment and comparing it with the present case's facts, especially regarding the jurisdiction over properties situated abroad.The court distinguished the current case from previous judgments, taking into account the non-contentious nature of the matter and the parties' submission to the court's jurisdiction. It highlighted the reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of judgments between Pakistan and other countries, including the UK and UAE, which would allow for the recognition and execution of the court's orders in those jurisdictions.Ultimately, the court granted the petition, emphasizing the global context of legal matters and the importance of addressing the rights and interests of ordinary citizens in a \"global village.\" The petitioner was instructed to file an interim report and account for the estate as per the Succession Act's requirements.",

The earlier view will be the binding precedent till such time it is in the field.2. Family court has no jurisdiction under clause 9 of Schedule to Section 5 of the Family Court Acts, 1964 in cases of enforcement of clause 18 and 19 of the Nikahnama which are dependent on the happening of or related to KHULA or DIVORCE. It vests in the ordinary courts as settled by the Supreme Court in the case of Mukhtar Hussaid Shah (PLD 2011 SC 260)A supreme court judgment, though later in time, is not binding if it has not considered an earlier view of a bench of co-equal strength; nor has referred the matter for constitution of a larger bench. The earlier view will be the binding precedent till such time it is in the field. --- The appellate judgment had modified a trial court decision from December 6, 2018, regarding the enforcement of conditions stated in column Nos. 18 & 19 of the Nikahnama (marriage contract).The core issue revolved around the enforcement of specific conditions in the Nikahnama, which stipulated a sum of Rs. 1,000,000 to be paid to the wife in the event of divorce by the husband. The trial court had concluded that such conditions could not be enforced as they were contrary to the principles of marital ties, which should not be bound by stringent conditions. However, the appellate court granted relief to the respondent based on these conditions, arguing that the family court had jurisdiction over the matter.Upon review, the High Court noted discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence regarding the Nikahnama's conditions. It observed that the matter was not adequately addressed on factual grounds by the lower courts, which instead focused on legal interpretations without first establishing the factual basis of the case. The High Court emphasized the importance of resolving factual discrepancies before applying legal principles.Furthermore, the High Court discussed the jurisdiction of family courts in matters involving conditions stipulated in the Nikahnama, referencing various Supreme Court judgments to clarify the legal stance on such issues. It concluded that the appellate court's judgment granting relief based on the contested conditions was not only beyond its jurisdiction but also unsupported by the evidence on record.The High Court ultimately set aside the appellate court's judgment, restoring the trial court's decision. The petition was allowed, highlighting the necessity of a factual basis for legal decisions and the proper application of jurisdiction in family law matters.",

It was highlighted that the minor had been unlawfully taken from the mother's custody and raised concerns about potential influence or harassment by the father (Opponent No.1) who had another wife.The petitioner, presumably the father, challenged this order, seeking to nullify it and to have the minor's custody transferred to him. The petitioner's argument was based on legal precedents emphasizing that matters of custody should be addressed under the Guardians and Wards Act and that the High Court's jurisdiction under Section 491 Cr.P.C. is to be exercised sparingly.The High Court, after reviewing the submissions and the relevant legal precedents, decided not to interfere with the impugned order. The Court found no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances warranting its intervention. It was noted that a guardianship application was already pending before the appropriate Family Court, which was competent to decide on the custody issue.The High Court concluded that the impugned order was passed with due consideration, including conditions that were in the minor's best interest, such as the requirement for a P.R Bond and the stipulation that the minor's custody could not be removed from the District of Matiari.Thus, the High Court dismissed the petition, maintaining that the observations made were tentative and would not impact any ongoing or future litigation between the parties regarding this matter.",

(g) Islamic law--- ---- Inheritance---Grand-children whose father or mother had survived their grand-father had no locus standi to claim inheritance in the estate of the deceased grand-father---Once father/mother of grand-children had died (true legal heirs of grand-father) they could file a suit for administration of the estate left by their deceased parents and if there was any undistributed property from the estate of their grand-father, continued to be in existence, they could include \"share\" of their deceased parents in the said estate of their own deceased father or mother but they could not reopen the issue of inheritance from the entire estate of their grand-parents---Grand-children could not claim as matter of their own right any share in the estate of their grand-father.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Family Courts Act, 1964 (section 14(1)(b)), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 1997 (sections 105), Guardian and Ward Act, 1890 (Section 25), Guardian and Ward Act, 1890 (47), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 1997 (Section 102 subsection 15 ), Guardian and Ward Act, 1890 (Section 9), West Pakistan Family Court Rules, 1965 (Rule 6), Citizenship Act, 1951The primary object of the Guardian & Ward Court or for that matter appellate Court was to discover as to where the welfare of the ward lies and how such welfare can be effectively achieved and maintained and should not have concerned with the visitation rights of father.--Jurisdiction Issue-The child may be an American national by birth and he may have been permanently residing in Kuwait with parents but he is a dual national. When the respondent/ father surrendered to the jurisdiction of the trial Court by moving an application under section 25 of the Guardian & Wards Act, it was promptly responded and replied by filing written statement and jurisdiction conceded by petitioner.--Once petitioner acquiesced to the jurisdiction, she cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time. The question of jurisdiction even if made dependent on ordinary residence of ward, it may not be a pure question of law that can be assailed at any forum or at any time. For that it has to be specifically pleaded so that the facts in this regard be brought to the notice of the Court. It is, thus, not a simple question of law rather a mixed question of law and facts which requires determination through evidence.--Movement or Restriction in Movement of ward-The ward belongs to a family which can afford a better upbringing, education and environment either in Pakistan or anywhere in the world which was restricted and curtailed by restriction in his movement. The Courts below should not have seen welfare only from the angle that the father/respondent must not miss his opportunity to see his child but it must also be seen from the angle as to whether a ward who is capable of studying abroad, in case the opportunities are available to him, should he be deprived of on account of the fact that father must not miss a visiting opportunity? --In any other case it would have been the welfare considering the situation of the ward while being at Karachi and only Pakistani national but the situation here is different as the child is privileged to have access to any educational institution around the world including Pakistan. An educational institute or an environment for which most of the children could only dream for. Every child has its own peculiar circumstances and the welfare demands may vary. The restriction in the movement in the present case appeared to be a tool to settle score with mother/petitioner but it will not serve as the welfare of the child. The father/respondent who had raised serious allegations against the mother/petitioner as he claimed that she is not fit to take care of ward yet is not serious in having the custody of the ward, although none of them stands proved in evidence. There are ways and mechanism to regulate the movement which is not achieved by of restricting the movement.",

From the statement of landlord/owner for the purpose of eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal bona fide need only an honest intention is to be deduced and there is no other formula to adjudge good and bad faith, for the purpose of eviction on the aforesaid count. If the Court on the scrutiny of the evidence comes to the conclusion that it was an honest intention then it would be immaterial whether he remained successful in achieving the object or not that is whether his son or daughter would join him in the business after completing their education. This requirement would be immaterial in the sense that the intention of the father in evicting the tenant was an honest one.Good faith is an abstract term not capable of any rigid definition and ordinary dictionary meaning describes it as \"honesty of intention\".-The primary requirement and condition precedent for invoking provision of Section 15(2)(vii) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 claiming relief on the ground of personal bonafide need of landlord in good faith is that the landlord should be honest in his approach and sincerity of his purpose should be manifested by irreversible evidence and surrounding circumstances.- Sufficiency of accommodation either for a commercial/industrial activity or for residential purpose is to be adjudged best by the landlord himself and it may vary not only on case to case basis but also on the basis of nature of business that one intends to establish an honest idea about future growth of the business and its prospects. Someone may have an idea of establishing humongous business set up and he may or may not be successful in achieving his object and plan but what is 9important, as a test, is the honesty of intention and there is nothing on record in the shape of cross-examination of the landlord/owner to demonstrate that it was not an honest and genuine intention for extending and enhancing business for himself and for his family members.",

And then the Court went on to observe that even if there is adecree of the Court, the stamp duty would be payable as per ValuationTable. Though on facts the said judgment is not relevant; nonetheless,since it has been cited before this Full Bench, therefore, we arecompelled to hold that we do not approve such observations made bythe Division Bench in the aforesaid paragraph. Had it been inperformance of decree, an instrument is being registered, it ought to beon the basis of value determined in the decree and/or agreemententered into for which performance is to be made in terms of Courtdecree. In such situation there was no occasion for altering/undervaluingthe property to avoid stamp duty as the value is already determined byCourt of law or decree. It is only in case when the property has changedits status lawfully i.e. from a built-up property to an open plot or from asemi-constructed property to a fully constructed property, the value ofthe property may be altered in instrument sought to be registered. Thus,when the property sold out on the basis of a decree, which decree hasvalued the property in question, then the right of valuing the propertydoes not rest with the vendor and vendee and/or the concernedauthority.

Accordingly, the interim pre-arrest bail granted to him vide order dated 08.07.2021 is hereby confirmed on the same terms and conditions---- The applicant, Muhammad Waleed, sought admission to bail pending trial in a case registered against him under Sections 337-F(vi) and 34 PPC at P.S. Zaman Town Korangi Karachi. The complainant, Abdul Rasheed, alleged that Waleed and two unknown persons attacked and injured him when he visited his in-laws' house. The complainant claimed injuries, and an FIR was registered. Waleed was initially granted interim pre-arrest bail, but it was later dismissed. The applicant argued that he is falsely implicated due to family disputes, emphasizing the element of enmity and stating that the injuries fall under Munaqqilah, not within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 P.P.C.The complainant and the Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application, citing the specific role assigned to the applicant in the FIR. The judge noted that the injury attribution requires further inquiry since three persons were nominated, and the prosecution did not establish whether the complainant was injured by Waleed alone or collectively by all attackers. The judge observed a family dispute and noted that the alleged offense did not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Additionally, he highlighted a delay in filing the FIR. Considering these factors, the judge applied the principle that bail is a rule and refusal an exception in such cases. The progress report indicated the completion of the investigation and framing of charges. The judge concluded that the applicant would not be required for further investigation, and there was no risk of evidence tampering. Therefore, the judge confirmed the interim pre-arrest bail, allowing the bail application on the same terms and conditions.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner is seeking the release of a Family Pension in her favor as the widow of the deceased Muhammad Ahmed Ilyas, a pensioner of the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (PTCL). The petitioner challenges the reply to a legal notice issued by Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust denying her the Family Pension based on a judgment and decree of Khula (dissolution of marriage) granted by the Family Court. The scheme benefits those falling under the definition of \"Family\" as per pension rules. The judges note that despite the petitioner's claim of reconciliation, her obtained Khula decree is a significant legal barrier to claiming the Family Pension. They conclude that a divorced wife's status cannot be recognized as a family member for pension entitlement, and her claim is dismissed. The judges acknowledge the factual controversies but reiterate that the case's determination rests on legal principles. They dismiss the petition and advise the petitioner to seek an appropriate remedy in accordance with the law.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner (grandfather) was never party to the suit. There is no cavil that in terms of para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F Mulla's, a grandfather in certain circumstances is bound to maintain his grandchildren but obligation of the grandfather to maintain his grandchildren is hedged with certain conditions. In order to understand the matter in issue in better terms, para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mulla's. Primarily it is the father who is bound to maintain his children, in case of son(s) until he (they) attain(s) the age of puberty and if there are daughters, till their marriage. In case, the father is poor and incapable of maintaining by his own, the mother would come into picture and if she is in easy circumstances, she would be bound to maintain her children in place of father. The liability of grandfather though starts when the father is poor and infirm and the mother is also not in a position to provide maintenance to her children but such liability of grandfather is dependent upon the fact that he should be in easy circumstances. After having a glimpse of the survey of law on the subject, I am of the firm view that Family Court can never be helpless to get its decree executed. The process of execution cannot shift towards the grandfather merely on the ground that decree could not be satisfied against the father (judgment debtor). The Family Court cannot assume the role of spectator rather it can adopt the procedure contained in \"CPC\" for the execution of the decree.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In appropriate cases, learned Family Courts to consider principle of appreciation in value of certain dowry articles: In present case, alternate value of car given in dowry was fixed as Rs.2,285,000/- by the learned Appellate Court below that is the amount, which was paid by the father of respondent No.3 when the car was booked in the year 2017, when the marriage of respondent No.3 with the petitioner took place. This Court is of the view that primarily a suit for the return of dowry articles, whenever decided, is decreed by the Courts as such with the observation that in case of failure, on part of the judgment-debtor, to return the said articles, as an alternate, the amount equivalent to the price of dowry articles is ordered to be paid and while determining the alternate value of the dowry articles, the Courts consider the depreciation of most of the dowry articles on account of normal and natural wear and tear thereof that takes place over the passage of time since marriage of the parties. The rationale underlying the application of principle of depreciation is that the dowry articles are to be returned in their current position and if the same is not done, their price is to be paid as an alternate and since most of the value of dowry articles put to use during the subsistence of marriage do undergo depreciation on account of said daily use, therefore, while determining the alternate price, it is justifiable that the depreciation in value of such articles is to be taken into account. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that there may be some articles forming part of the dowry, for instance, the gold ornaments or the vehicles or even few electrical appliances etc., value whereof may appreciate over the years. The car, in the instant case is such an article. Therefore, the learned Appellate Court below erred in not considering the appreciation in the value of the car while fixing/determining the alternate price thereof inasmuch as this is common knowledge that value of Pak Rupees has depreciated over the number of years and the value of new as well as used vehicles, like the car in instant case, is on continuous rise. Therefore, awarding amount spent on purchase of the car in the year 2017 is not justified and respondent No.3 is held entitled to recover the market value of the car as on date of realization of the decree.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [Civil Procedure Code CPC (Civil transfer Application dismissed. )] These cases involved the transfer of Suit from a Family Court in Hyderabad to the Family Court in Umerkot, and challenged to the orders of the Family Court under Rules 5 & 6 of the Family Court Rules, 1965. The petitioner, contests the jurisdiction of the trial court where her husband filed a suit for judicial separation under Hindu Family Laws. While the husband claimed residency within the jurisdiction of Police Station Bhitai Nagar Hyderabad, the petitioner contested this assertion, claiming the husband's last residence was in village Rajo Khanani, District Hyderabad. The court examined Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family Court Rules 1965, which determined jurisdiction based on the cause of action and the residency of the parties. It noted that the husband, being Hindu, filed a suit for judicial separation under Hindu laws, attempting to establish jurisdiction based on the cause of action. However, the court found discrepancies in the addresses provided by both parties and questioned the validity of the cause of action at the mentioned police station. The court partially allowed the petition, setting aside the impugned order and restoring the application for reconsideration based on the facts presented. It emphasized that the transfer of a case should not be solely for the convenience of the parties and directed the trial court to frame and dispose of the issue of jurisdiction within one month, with evidence if necessary, in accordance with Rule 6 of the Family Court Rules 1965. The order rendered the transfer application moot, as the trial court would now reconsider the jurisdictional issues. The court instructed expeditious handling of the matter, not exceeding six weeks, to decide the question of jurisdiction.",

The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment and fines for these offenses. The court then discusses mitigating circumstances presented by the defense, including the fact that the appellant is the main breadwinner for a large family and is not a previous convict. Taking these factors into account, the court decides to reduce the sentences imposed on the appellant while keeping some fines and penalties intact. The court specifies the new sentences and fines for the various charges.

Examination of the impugned order/judgment of the Courts below reveals that the learned Courts have not kept the aim, object and scope of the Family Courts Act, 1964 in mind while interpreting the judgment and decree dated 25.11.2010 and have reached to a misconceived conclusion that it will be safe to allow the annual increase from the date of decree instead of the date of institution of the suit. It is pertinent to observe that any ambiguity in the decree as to grant of annual increase from the date of institution or from the date of decree would be so construed as to be not incongruous to the object and purpose of law which is a beneficial legislation and in this manner, the instant case exhibits a fortiori situation inasmuch as when the Act 1964 itself, being beneficial legislation, cannot be construed and interpreted in a manner detrimental to the minor or female, the judgment and decree passed under such law cannot be so interpreted.",

It is settled by now that the minor could not be burdened with onus to prove the financial status and payment capacity of his father to be held entitled to maintenance allowance rather it was for the father to prove his financial sources which, if he fails to prove, inference is to be drawn against him. The maintenance for past six years could be allowed by the Family Court as a suit for maintenance allowance would be governed by the residuary Article 120 of the Schedule attached to the Limitation Act, 1908 providing limitation of six years. It is settled position of law that the interim maintenance allowance paid during the pendency of the suit in compliance of orders passed by the court is to be adjusted from the amount determined in the final decree.",

The dismissal of application under Section 21-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964, which is a remedy provided under express provision of the said Act through which interim relief of protection of property during the pendency of pending family suit has been refused is a decision given which is appealable in terms of Section 14 of the Act; hence, without availing the said remedy, direct constitutional petition is not maintainable due to availability of alternate remedy, hence, the constitutional petition being premature is disposed of with observation that, if advised, the petitioner may seek the available remedy before approaching this Court.",

She says that the money was deposited in her account in Meezan Bank (by Gulzar Ahmed) and that she had issued cheques for withdrawing the same.

He was found engaged in buying and selling two very expensive properties in DHA Karachi. The money found to have exchanged his hands in this respect runs in myriad millions. Further he is found to have established a liaison for this purpose i.e. sale and purchase with petitioner Gulzar Ahmed whose counsel in his arguments did not deny this fact. But explained that Gulzar Ahmed was a broker and had dealt with him professionally only; had received money from him and then passed on to the party concerned as per business mores. Which is prima facie a glaring indictment of the role ascribed to the petitioner in the reference. When it is considered together with evidence of holding of assets by him, ostensibly beyond his means, in his name in Karachi furnishes sufficient material to believe his involvement in the alleged offence .Therefore, pre arrest bail is dismissed.",

The Respondents claimed that they were equal parties to the property and that a family settlement had been reached. According to the Respondents, an award was made, and the settlement was handed over to the Patwari for incorporation into the Revenue Record. However, the Petitioners alleged that an impugned mutation was sanctioned, transferring the property to them, despite the existence of the family settlement. The main issues before the Supreme Court were: Whether the family settlement was proven and its effect.Whether the impugned mutation could be sanctioned. Regarding the impugned mutation, the High Court found that the Patwari did not fulfill his duty in accordance with the law. The Petitioners' attorney and an attesting witness testified that the settlement and award were handed over to the Patwari, but he improperly obtained signatures on a blank form and sanctioned the mutation. The High Court concluded that the Patwari's actions were tainted with mala fide. Based on these findings, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, ruling in favor of the Respondents. The Court affirmed the validity of the family settlement and determined that the impugned mutation was improperly sanctioned.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner in this case has challenged the order issued by the learned Judge Family Court, Gujranwala, and the judgment issued by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala. The petitioner was married to respondent No.3 on 31.12.2005, with a dower of 32.25 tola gold ornaments, which was later taken back by respondent No.3. Additionally, the petitioner received dowry articles worth Rs.13,91,000 from her parents. Due to conflicts between the parties, the petitioner filed for dissolution of marriage, recovery of dower, dowry articles, and maintenance. The Family Court decreed the dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula under Section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. However, the petitioner contested that the grounds for dissolution, namely failure to pay maintenance and cruel behavior, fall under Section 2(ii) and (viii)(a) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, which does not allow dissolution based on Khula. Legal precedents cited include the case of Sardar Abid Iqbal vs. Tabassam Khursheed (2009 YLR 1745) and Mst. Saima Irum vs. Tariq Javed (2005 S.L.R. 655), emphasizing that the court cannot pass a decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula unless specifically requested by the wife. The court must ensure that the wife voluntarily surrenders her right to dower. The court highlighted the difference between Talaq and Khula, stating that Khula is initiated by the wife and requires her to forego certain rights, whereas Talaq is initiated by the husband and entails paying the dower to the wife. In conclusion, the court found that neither the petitioner intended nor requested dissolution based on Khula, and therefore, the orders issued by the Family Court and the Additional District Judge were without jurisdiction. The petitioner's case for dower will continue before the Family Court, allowing respondent No.3 to present their defense. Consequently, the petition was allowed, and a decree for dissolution of marriage was granted in favor of the petitioner, based on other grounds justifying dissolution.",

Rehana Shamas (the respondent), as per their nikahnama. The respondent filed a suit seeking recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and dissolution of marriage. The family court decreed in favor of the respondent, which was upheld by the appellate court. The petitioner challenged the judgments primarily regarding the grant of dower, arguing that the transfer of a house mentioned in the nikahnama constituted deferred dower and shouldn't be paid during the marriage. The petitioner's counsel argued that the marriage's terms related to the transfer of the house were deferred dower, citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court in Saadia Usman v. Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel referred to the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, contending that the dower was on demand, obligating the petitioner to hand over the house or its value. The case examined various columns of the nikahnama and Section 10 of the Ordinance to determine the nature of the dower. Dower in Islam can be specified or unspecified, prompt, or deferred, with no upper limit set. The Supreme Court's precedent emphasized the importance of clarity in defining prompt and deferred dower in the nikahnama. Saadia Usman v. Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon (2009): This case established principles regarding deferred dower and the necessity for clarity in defining the nature of dower in the nikahnama. Mst. Yasmeen Bibi v. Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan and others (2016): This case highlighted that entries in various columns of the nikahnama are part of undertakings related to dower, emphasizing clarity in defining dower in the nikahnama. Syed Sajjad Hussain v. Judge Family Court etc. (2019): This case discussed the waiver of entitlement to deferred dower through consent or conduct. State Bank of Pakistan through Governor & another v. Imtiaz Ali Khan & others (2012): This case emphasized the doctrine of laches in legal matters. Ghulam Hussain Ramzan Ali v. Collector of Customs (Preventive), Karachi (2014): This case further discussed the doctrine of laches in legal proceedings. The court ruled that since the nikahnama didn't specify the mode or time of payment for the house mentioned under column No. 16, it constituted deferred dower, and the respondent was entitled to claim it. The petitioner's contradictory statements and the delay in filing the petition led to its dismissal on grounds of laches.",

During the trial, the prosecution presented two eyewitnesses, both brothers of the complainant, to support the charges against the appellant. However, critical inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's case emerged: The delay in reporting the incident to the police, the absence of spot recovery, and the lack of blood evidence at the crime scene raised doubts about the credibility of the prosecution's case. The medical evidence presented during the trial contradicted the prosecution's narrative. The autopsy report indicated injuries inconsistent with the alleged weapon used by the appellant, suggesting the possibility of the child's injuries resulting from a fall rather than a deliberate attack. The prosecution failed to establish a clear motive for the appellant's alleged actions, and essential witnesses, including the child's mother, were not produced in court. In light of these inconsistencies and shortcomings in the prosecution's case, the court ruled in favor of the appellant. The appellant's conviction and sentence were overturned, and she was acquitted of all charges.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Any noticeable delay in lodging the FIR is normally occasioned due to incomplete police papers necessary to be handed over to the Medical Officer to conduct the postmortem examination on dead body of the deceased which happens only when the Complainant and police remain busy in consultation and preliminary inquiry regarding the culprits in such cases of un-witnessed occurrence. Even the testimony of injured witness is to be subject to scrutiny, for making it basis of conviction.-----In the case of Nasir Abbas and Muhammad Saleem, they were tried for offenses including murder, attempted murder, and other charges. The trial court convicted Nasir Abbas of murder and sentenced him to death, along with other sentences, while Muhammad Saleem was sentenced to life imprisonment and other terms. The appellants filed an appeal against these convictions. The prosecution's case was based on the eyewitness accounts of the complainant and other witnesses who claimed that the appellants shot and killed Manazir Ali and injured Muhammad Ijaz due to a family dispute related to an engagement. However, the court highlighted several inconsistencies and weaknesses in the prosecution's case. The court noted a significant delay in reporting the incident to the police, raising doubts about the veracity of the prosecution's version. It also pointed out discrepancies in the statements of the eyewitnesses regarding the details of their travel and the purchases they made. The court questioned the reliability of identifying the accused solely based on the headlights of the cars during a night occurrence and emphasized the lack of possession of the car used by the witnesses at the time of the incident. Medical evidence, particularly the absence of burning and blackening on the deceased's body, contradicted the eyewitness accounts. The court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish a motive for the crime, as the family relationship and engagement mentioned were not adequately supported by evidence. Considering the inconsistencies in the ocular and medical evidence, doubts about the motive, and lack of corroboration, the court acquitted both appellants, setting aside their convictions and sentences. The court also declined to confirm the death sentence for Nasir Abbas, and both appellants were ordered to be released if not required in any other case.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Suit for recovery of maintenance allowance, dower, and dowry articles was filed by respondents No.3 to 8, and another passed by the learned District Judge, Muzaffargarh, dismissing the petitioner's appeal against the aforementioned judgment. The marriage between the petitioner and respondent No.3 occurred in 2004, resulting in the birth of respondents No.4 to 8. Respondents No.3 to 8 filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance allowance, dower, and dowry articles against the petitioner, which was partially decreed by the trial court. The petitioner's appeal was also dismissed by the appellate court, leading to this writ petition. The petitioner's counsel argued at length, emphasizing the evidence presented during the trial. Respondent No.3 herself appeared as a witness and provided her statement, corroborated by Muhammad Aslam, while the petitioner admitted to the marriage and the birth of four sons and one daughter. The main point of contention revolves around the quantum of dower amount. The marriage was solemnized orally, and no written Nikahnama was produced. The determination of proper dower (Mehr-Misl) is discussed in light of Islamic jurisprudence, emphasizing the wife's entitlement to receive reasonably appropriate dower. Legal precedents such as Mst. Manzoor Elahi Vs Muhammad Nawaz & Others (2002 MLD 988) and Zulfiqar Ali Vs. Judge, Family Court & 7 Others (2007 MLD 1710) are cited. The petitioner's counsel failed to identify any illegality, material irregularity, or jurisdictional defect in the judgments of the lower courts. The concurrent findings of fact are deemed against the petitioner, warranting no interference by this Court. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed in limine for being misconceived and devoid of merit.",

The order denied the petitioners' request to be removed from the list of defendants in a family suit for the recovery of dowry items brought by respondent No.2 against her husband (respondent No.3) and the petitioners (who are the brother, mother, and sister-in-law of respondent No.3). The petitioners argued that they were improperly included as defendants in the suit, contending that only respondent No.3 should have been sued. However, the court determined that the petitioners were necessary parties for a proper resolution of the dispute under Section 2(d) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. This section defines a party as any person whose presence is deemed necessary for a proper decision. The court cited legal precedents, including the case of Wajid Abbasi v. Tahira Jamil (2013 MLD 755), to justify its decision. In this case, the court refused to add a defendant where dissolution of marriage wasn't sought against them, which the court deemed distinguishable from the present case. Furthermore, the court emphasized the importance of fair trial and due process, citing the case of Babar Hussain Shah v. Mujeeb Ahmed Khan(2012 SCMR 1235). It stressed that orders violating due process may be considered void, highlighting the significance of providing fair trial rights to all parties. Ultimately, the court found no legal grounds to interfere with the lower court's decision, dismissing the petition. However, it instructed the trial court to proceed with the case independently, unaffected by any observations made in the dismissal order.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case involves a dispute between a petitioner and respondent No.1 regarding the delivery of 5 tolas of gold ornaments promised at the time of marriage. The petitioner filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance allowance, gold ornaments, and dowry articles, which was partially decreed by the Family Court. The respondent was ordered to deliver the gold ornaments or pay Rs. 2,50,000 as their price. During execution proceedings, the respondent expressed willingness to pay the price instead of delivering the ornaments, leading to a legal challenge. The Executing Court initially directed the respondent to pay the market value of the gold ornaments, considering prevailing legal principles. However, the decision was reversed by the Additional District Judge, who argued that the decree fixed the price, and the respondent could satisfy it by paying Rs. 2,50,000. Upon review, the court found that the decree was not merely a money decree but specifically aimed at recovering 5 tolas of gold ornaments. The petitioner was entitled to either the ornaments or their current market value, as per established legal precedents. The respondent's delay and refusal to deliver the ornaments were deemed unfair, and the court upheld the Executing Court's decision to seek the market rate of gold to enable the petitioner to obtain the ornaments. The judgment ultimately allowed the writ petition, declaring the Additional District Judge's order unlawful and restoring the Executing Court's decision. The judgment refers to several legal precedents to support its decision, including: Mst. Humaira Majeed v. Habib Ahmad: Emphasized the importance of delivering gold ornaments or their market value to the decree-holder. Mst. Ayesha Shaheen v. Khalid Mehmood: Established the right of the wife to recover gold ornaments or their market value.Haji Muhammad Nawaz v. Samina Kanwal: Highlighted the court's authority to enforce the execution of a decree regarding dowry articles. These precedents informed the court's decision to uphold the petitioner's right to receive the promised gold ornaments or their equivalent market value.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: This Constitutional petition concerns a dispute over the recovery of dowry articles following the dissolution of a marriage between Mst. Fehmeeda Younis and respondent No.3. Initially, the Family Court granted maintenance allowance and decreed the recovery of dowry articles or monetary compensation. However, respondent No.3 appealed, resulting in the Addl. District Judge partially allowing the appeal and setting aside the decree for dowry articles recovery. The petitioner challenged this decision, arguing that the Addl. District Judge overlooked evidence and based the judgment on erroneous reasoning. The petitioner's counsel asserted that the judgment of the Family Court was well-reasoned and supported by evidence. The Addl. District Judge's judgment ignored key factors and relied on questionable comparisons of signatures without considering expert opinions. The judgment lacked legal basis and jurisdictional soundness. In conclusion, the Constitutional petition was allowed, and the Addl. District Judge's judgment is declared illegal and without lawful jurisdiction.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [Section 14 and Sub-section (2) of Section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and Sections 8 to 11 of the Oaths Act, 1873. Binding effect of an offer of special oath, if accepted by the other party] The petitioner, Sajid Mehmood, appealed against the dismissal of his suit for recovery of dower, dowry The petitioner had voluntarily offered to take a special oath regarding the dowry articles and the allegation that he had sold the gold ornaments. The respondent accepted the offer and took a special oath affirming the details of the dowry articles and the sale of gold ornaments. The Family Court decided the suit in favor of the respondent based on the special oath. The petitioner appealed the decision, arguing that the case should have been decided on its merits rather than relying on the special oath. The petitioner's counsel contended that the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (QSO 1984) was not applicable to Family Court proceedings under Section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. However, it was acknowledged that the petitioner himself had filed the application for a special oath. The court examined the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873, which allowed parties in litigation to offer each other to accept or reject a claim on a special oath. The court concluded that once an offer to be bound by a special oath was accepted, a binding agreement was formed, and the party making the offer had no right to withdraw from it. The court emphasized that the Oaths Act should not give unfair advantage to either party. Therefore, the Family Court was obligated to implement the agreement and make a decision based on the special oath. The court referred to previous judgments that upheld decisions based on special oaths under the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873. It stated that the special oath in the present case was not covered by Article 163 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat (Law of Evidence), and the alleged violation of any prescribed procedure was unfounded. Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the civil petition and refused to grant leave. The judgment of the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench was upheld.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: After taking early retirement on medical grounds and subsequently passing away, his wife filed a claim for the sum assured from the insurer. The insurer repudiated the claim, stating that the revised policy did not cover early retirees. In response, respondent No. 1 filed an application for recovery of the group insurance claim and liquidated damages. The case was heard by the Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, which declined to grant liquidated damages based on the absence of a clause for such damages in the revised contract. However, the first Appellate Court held that under the implied terms of every contract of insurance, liquidated damages should be granted if the claim is not settled within ninety days without any fault of the claimant. Additionally, the Insurance Tribunal ruled that the legal heirs of the assured person had no standing to claim liquidated damages since the assured person was not a party to the group insurance contract. The first Appellate Court rejected this understanding, stating that group insurance is designed to provide benefits to the family of the assured person, and the insurer had already entertained the claim and paid the sum assured to the family. The Supreme Court, after considering both judgments, upheld the reasoning of the first Appellate Court and dismissed the appeal. The court concluded that the insurer's repudiation of the claim based on the revised contract was not lawful, and the legal heirs were entitled to receive liquidated damages under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. The summary also mentions that the contract became effective after the repudiation letter was issued, and the insurer failed to prove that its failure to pay the claim within the stipulated time was due to circumstances beyond its control. As a result, the appeal was deemed without merit and dismissed by the Supreme Court.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: It was observed that the petitioner filed a civil suit before the civil court, even though the family court had jurisdiction over such matters. The consolidation of the two suits in a single proceeding was deemed inappropriate since causes from different jurisdictions cannot be consolidated. It was highlighted that suits challenging the validity of Nikah Nama entries fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the family court. The court further noted that an amendment to the Family Courts Act in Punjab in 2015 specified that suits challenging Nikah Nama entries should be tried exclusively by the family court. As a result, the suit filed by the petitioner should have been considered a family suit and properly consolidated with respondent No. 3's suit. After considering the arguments and reviewing the Nikah Nama entries, the court found no cutting or variation in the original record. The findings of fact recorded by the trial court were deemed correct, and the petitioner failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional defects committed by the lower courts. Therefore, the court refused to grant leave to appeal, and the petition was dismissed",

During the proceedings, the court directed Neha Ali to appear and ordered a medical board to determine Asima Bibi's gender. In compliance with the court's orders, Neha Ali was produced before the court, expressing her desire to live independently and continue her studies. The court, invoking Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, emphasized the liberty of an individual and set Neha Ali at liberty, allowing her to live as she pleases within the bounds of the law. The court directed law enforcement to provide security to Neha Ali and cautioned against any harassment by her family. It held that Neha Ali, being sui juris, cannot be detained against her wishes, and her freedom should be respected. Additionally, the court disapproved of the unwarranted observations on Neha Ali's marriage in the previous order by the Additional Sessions Judge and clarified that such matters should be addressed in Family Court or criminal proceedings. The court also ordered NADRA to reconsider the gender entry for Asima Bibi's CNIC, following proper legal procedures. The court recalled the order to place Asima Bibi in the Exit Control List, allowing the federal government to proceed as per legal requirements.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner, Muhammad Ramzan, along with his brothers, was convicted for committing the murder of Mushtaq Ahmad. The incident occurred due to a dispute over water in the precincts of Police Station Saddar Vehari. The petitioner was sentenced to death, while his brothers were given life imprisonment. The High Court altered the petitioner's penalty to life imprisonment and acquitted the co-convicts.The petitioner's counsel argued that the ocular account provided by the witnesses was unreliable, and there was no motive established for the petitioner's involvement in the murder. The counsel also pointed out discrepancies in the medical examination and crime report, suggesting the possibility of innocent proxies being involved. The Court noted that the entire family had been implicated in the crime, and the single fatal wound did not align with the array of accused individuals.Considering the uncertainty and potential errors in identifying the actual offender, the Court found it unsafe to maintain the petitioner's conviction. The jail petition was converted into an appeal, and the Court acquitted the petitioner of the charges. The impugned judgment was set aside, and the petitioner was ordered to be released forthwith",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (transfer of case in a family matter, conditions and requirments)---The suit, which involved the recovery of maintenance and dowry articles, was initially decreed ex-parte by the Judge Family Court in Islamabad West on February 24, 2020. However, since the respondent resided in Karachi, it was not feasible to execute the decree in Islamabad. The applicant, Mst. Kulsoom Rasheed, represented herself and requested the transfer of the case from the Judge Family Court in Islamabad West to the competent jurisdiction of the Family Court in Karachi, Sindh. The applicant relied on Section 25-A (2-B) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, which allows for the transfer of cases from one province to another. The relevant provision was quoted in the order. After considering the legal position and the circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court found that it would be burdensome for the respondent to participate in the proceedings in Islamabad, considering that he resided in Karachi. Therefore, to protect the rights and interests of both parties and ensure a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 10A of the Constitution, the Supreme Court ordered the transfer of the execution proceedings to the District Judge in Karachi. The transferee court would continue the proceedings from where they were left off, after due notice to the respondent.",

The Finance Department of the Government of Punjab had issued a clarification stating that an unmarried daughter cannot receive family pension from both parents simultaneously if one pension constitutes her regular income.The Supreme Court examined the relevant laws and the impugned clarification issued by the Finance Department. It found multiple constitutional and legal defects in the clarification, including encroachment upon the rule-making power of the Governor and violation of the right to pension provided under the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974. The Court also noted the discriminatory treatment between unmarried sons and daughters regarding the entitlement to family pension. It held that the clarification was illegal and unconstitutional.The Court emphasized the constitutional significance of the right to pension, which derives from the right to life or livelihood under the Constitution. Depriving children of civil servants of their family pension based on an unauthorized and unlawful clarification was deemed to offend the dignity of the deceased civil servants who were assured pension security. The Court struck down the clarification and ordered that the respondent's pension should continue in accordance with the law. However, the respondent would be disentitled from drawing pension upon marriage or acquiring a regular source of income, regardless of the family pension received. The Supreme Court dismissed the petitions and declined leave to appeal, affirming the well-reasoned findings of the High Court.",

The allegation against Muhammad Yousaf was that he committed rape against Ruqaya Bibi (the complainant) after abducting her. The court observed that the delay in reporting the alleged abduction and rape, the existence of a valid Nikah between the petitioner and the complainant, and the contradictory versions presented in the FIR and other documents raised doubts about the reliability of the evidence. The court emphasized that disputes involving marriage should be decided by Family Courts, and criminal courts should await the outcome of the family court proceedings. The court granted post-arrest bail to Muhammad Yousaf, a previous non-convict, with the case deemed one of further inquiry into the petitioner's guilt. Bail was subject to furnishing bonds of Rs. 500,000 with two sureties each, to the satisfaction of the trial court.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [Impact of fraud practiced upon tribunals exercising plenary or limited jurisdictions, respectively, cannot be procedurally classified as in all jurisdictions it un-redeamedly vitiates the very solemnity of adjudication, a wrong that cannot be countenanced and must be remedied through dynamic application of equitable principles of law] The main argument presented by the petitioner's counsel was that the suit filed by Khurshid Begum was fraudulently devised and structured, using a marriage certificate with interpolated entries to defeat the petitioner's legitimate rights. The respondent's counsel argued that the land in question was given as dower to Khurshid Begum and that no subsequent transactions could invalidate her interest in the land. After hearing the arguments and examining the record, the Supreme Court held that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to reexamine its earlier decision and set aside the decree if it was tainted by fraud or misrepresentation. The Court noted that the Family Court Act of 1964 excluded certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, but this did not prevent the Family Court from protecting its orders and decrees from fraud. The Court concluded that the Family Court could borrow procedures from other available avenues to rectify any manipulation or abuse of its jurisdiction. The Court referred to previous cases where fraud had been held to vitiate proceedings, even in jurisdictions that excluded the wholesale application of the Code. It rejected the suggestion of resorting to plenary jurisdiction and instead ordered the reconsideration of the impugned judgment and decree by the Family Court. The petitioner's claim in the property was to be attended to by the Additional District Judge, Multan, before whom the petitioner's application under section 12(2) of the Code would be deemed pending. Previous judgment was set aside.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The background of the case involved an Evacuee Property, transferred to Waheed Ahmad and Saeed Ahmad. Waheed Ahmad agreed to sell his share to Bashir Ahmad, leading to a specific performance suit and later a partition suit. The petitioner, after a significant delay, filed an application under section 4 of the Act, claiming the property as an undivided dwelling of a family and expressing willingness to purchase the share of respondents for a specified amount. The court, in its analysis, questions the delay in raising the plea under section 4, considering the conduct of the petitioners and their predecessor. It observed that the petitioners did not challenge the sale or decree earlier and concludes that their conduct reflects waiver and estoppel. The court also examined the merits of the objection under section 4 and cites relevant legal provisions and precedents. Additionally, the court noted the abuse of legal process by the judgment-debtors and emphasizes the need to address the prolonged execution proceedings. The court dismissed the revision, imposes costs on the petitioner, and directs the executing court to proceed with the execution of the decree promptly.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Dismissed---The petitioners contested the conviction, arguing that they were falsely implicated in the case due to a family dispute over property. They claimed that the evidence provided by the prosecution was not strong enough to warrant a conviction. Additionally, the petitioners pointed out discrepancies in the deposition of the police surgeon regarding the date of examination, which they claimed affected the credibility of the evidence.After hearing the arguments and examining the record, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the petitioners. The Court noted that the evidence presented by the prosecution, including the witnesses' testimony and the site plan showing broken glass in the shop, supported the guilty verdict. The Court dismissed the petitioners' claim that they were unfairly implicated due to a family dispute and rejected their challenge to the credibility of the police surgeon's evidence.The Court also addressed the concern raised by the petitioners about the possible loss of pensionary benefits for the family of the deceased petitioner, Javed Ahmed. The Court held that this consequence of the crime should not be a ground to overturn Javed Ahmed's conviction, as he was part of the joint criminal act and was rightly convicted based on the evidence.In conclusion, the Supreme Court found no merit in the petition and declined to grant leave.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: the petitioner, sought relief concerning the alleged illegal detention of her minor children\u00f3Moqaddas Bibi, Muhammad Arslan, and Muhammad Farhan\u00f3by respondent No. 2, Muhammad Akhtar, their father. The petitioner claimed that the minors were taken from her custody on 25.01.2019.The court, considering the ages of the minors and the petitioner's rights as the mother, found that no counter affidavit challenging the petitioner's claims had been filed. Although the marriage between the parties was not intact, there was nothing adverse against the petitioner to deny her custody. The court interviewed Muhammad Farhan, one of the detained minors, who revealed that he worked at a motorcycle shop and did not attend school.Respondent No. 2's counsel argued that the matter was pending before the Guardian court, and decisions related to custody and welfare should be left to that court. However, the court, invoking its power under Section 491 Cr.P.C., emphasized its duty to ensure the welfare of the minors and prevent harm due to the breakdown of family ties. The court cited the case of Mirjam Aberras Lehdeaho v. S.H.O., Police Station Chung, Lahore (2018 SCMR 427).Consequently, the court allowed the petition, ordering the custody of the minors to be handed over to the petitioner. The petitioner was directed to facilitate respondent No. 2's meetings with the children as directed by the Guardian court, emphasizing that the Guardian court's decision would be independent of the observations in this order.",

However, after investigation, the police found the allegations false and recommended FIR cancellation. During the revision, it was revealed that the petitioner altered his story significantly in the private complaint, and key witnesses were not mentioned in the FIR. The complainant made two allegations: torture leading to his father's death and Mst. Razia Bibi pouring a liquid into his father's mouth. Medical evidence contradicted the allegations, indicating the cause of death as a cardiac arrest, not injury or poisoning. Hospital records showed the deceased was taken to the hospital by Ahmad Faraz (a distant relative), not the complainant. Previous disputes within the family, including a previous FIR against the petitioner, his father's first wife, and ongoing property litigation, were also noted. Consequently, the criminal revision was dismissed in limine (at the outset).",

The issue arose when a new procedure for pension withdrawal was introduced in May 2016, and the petitioner faced difficulties in withdrawing the pension of her deceased father due to the impugned clarification issued in September 2015.The court, after hearing arguments and examining the relevant rules and notifications, allowed the writ petition. It set aside the impugned notification, declaring that a child of deceased parents who were government servants is entitled to two pensions simultaneously according to their eligibility.The decision emphasized that the drawal of pension was a vested right of the child, and such rights cannot be taken away through a notification with retrospective effect.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner sought relief through Article 199 of the Constitution, read with section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. The petitioner requested the court to declare orders as void ab initio illegal, directing the recovery of the detainee, aged about 03 years, from the custody of respondents No.3-4. Additionally, the petitioner sought custody of Azan and any other relief deemed fit. The respondents No.3 & 4 argued that the petitioner had willingly handed over custody during a compromise in the Family Court, Sialkot. The petitioner's counsel contended that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction in custody matters, and even if the petitioner had compromised, she cannot be deprived of her right to 'Hizanat.' The court dismissed the objection that a similar petition was previously dismissed, stating that an earlier decision in a habeas corpus matter does not operate as res judicata. The court allowed the petition, setting aside the impugned orders and ordering the custody of the minor, to be handed over to the petitioner/real mother. The respondents No.3 & 4 were granted the liberty to approach the Guardian Court for regularization of custody if desired.",

The suit claimed that the inheritance mutations of certain lands were obtained fraudulently, excluding the rightful heirs. The trial court decreed the suit, and the appellate court modified the decree, stating that plaintiffs and defendants No.13 and 14 were entitled to inheritance and the entries in the revenue record.The petitioners challenge the judgments, arguing that the parties were governed by customary law, not Sharia. They assert that crucial facts, including a Revenue Officer's decision in 1933, were overlooked. The petitioners claim that the suit is time-barred and dispute the application of Section 2(A) of the Muslim Personal Law Shariat Application Act. They also contend that the findings on various issues are not sustainable under the law.The court reviews the evidence and concludes that the family was governed by Islamic law. It emphasizes that the daughters and widow were entitled to inherit the property and dismisses arguments related to limitation. The court also rejects the relevance of cited case law to the present circumstances.Furthermore, the court modifies the appellate court's findings, stating that all daughters and the widow or their legal heirs are entitled to inherit the property. The court dismissed the application for impleadment during the revision, citing the doctrine of lis pendens.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Order under section 12 of the Guardian & Wards Act, 1890 is appealable----The petitioner had married respondent No. 2 on May 6, 2011, and they had a son named Muhammad Danial, born on February 11, 2012. Due to strained relations, the petitioner and respondent No. 2 mutually agreed to divorce on April 23, 2012. Subsequently, respondent No. 2 entered into a second marriage with Muhammad Ikhalq on June 21, 2013.The dispute arose when respondent No. 1 filed an application for his appointment as the guardian of the minor, Muhammad Danial, on September 21, 2015. The application stated that the child had been living with respondent No. 1 since birth, a fact that respondent No. 2 confirmed during her testimony on October 9, 2015. The petitioner submitted a reply to this guardian petition and, on November 14, 2015, filed a guardian petition for the custody of his son under section 25 of the Guardian & Wards Act, 1890.Respondents No. 1 and 2 filed written replies to the petitioner's petitions. Additionally, respondent No. 2 filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance, dower amount, and dowry articles against the petitioner on May 11, 2016.After reconciliation attempts failed, the trial court consolidated the suit and the petitioner's guardian petition on May 29, 2017. The trial court's order, dated June 12, 2017, dismissed the application under section 12 of the Act, allowing the petitioner to meet his son twice a month on certain conditions within the court premises.The petitioner filed a constitutional petition challenging this order. The respondent's counsel argued that the constitutional petition was not maintainable, as appealable orders could be appealed under the Family Courts Act, 1964. The petitioner's counsel contended that the order was not appealable, and therefore, the constitutional petition was competent.The court ruled that the order was appealable before the District Court under the Family Courts Act, 1964. Consequently, the constitutional petition was dismissed. The court also advised the petitioner to file an appeal or repeat the application under section 12 of the Act, as interim custody orders could be modified based on changing circumstances.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In this case, Sahibzada Muhammad Hussain Raza, the petitioner, sought a court direction to the respondents, which includes the Provincial Election Commission, to include his name in the voter list. Additionally, he requested that the respondents issue him nomination papers to contest the upcoming elections as a candidate for the Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA) seat in his constituency (Constituency No. PP-113, Faisalabad).The petitioner, Sahibzada Muhammad Hussain Raza, is from a politically influential family, and his father was a former Minister. His brother, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, is a leader of the Sunni Ittehad Council. However, despite being eligible to vote, the petitioner's name was not included in the voter list, which prompted him to file a petition.The petitioner had contacted respondent No. 2 (presumably an official from the Election Commission) on April 26, 2018, and was initially informed that he had a vote in the voter list. However, later, when he checked the voter list, his name was missing. He filed an application on June 5, 2018, before the Provincial Election Commissioner, requesting the inclusion of his vote based on his CNIC, domicile certificate, and family registration certificate. As this application had not been decided, he approached the court by filing this writ petition.The petitioner argued that it was the responsibility of the respondents to include his name in the voter list, especially since other family members were already enrolled voters in the constituency. He mentioned specific sections of the Elections Act, 2017, that empower the Election Commission to amend the electoral roll and enroll eligible voters.On the other hand, the respondent argued that the petitioner had not informed the election commission in a timely manner about his desire to be enrolled as a voter, which was required by Section 39 of the Elections Act, 2017. They also contended that including the petitioner's name at this stage would create logistical issues and burdens on the election commission.After hearing both sides, the court considered various provisions of the Constitution and the Elections Act, 2017. The court concluded that the petitioner, being a citizen of the country with a valid CNIC, was entitled to vote and contest elections. The omission to enroll his vote was not solely his fault, and the responsibility also lay with the Election Commission and the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to ensure accurate data transmission. The court ordered the immediate enrollment of the petitioner as a voter in his constituency and the issuance of nomination forms for the MPA seat without further delay.This order sheet emphasizes the importance of ensuring that all eligible citizens have the opportunity to vote and participate in the democratic process, especially during the election season.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Shabbir Ahmad was married to respondent No.4 under The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and they had minor children. Respondent No.4 filed a suit for the recovery of dower, gold ornaments, and maintenance due to matrimonial disputes. The petitioner resisted the suit, and after various legal proceedings, the Family Court partially decreed the suit in May 2016. Both parties appealed this judgment.The petitioner's counsel argued that the suit should not have proceeded in court since the matter had previously been resolved by the Arbitration Council, and the maintenance awarded was excessive. The petitioner contended that the judgments were legally flawed and the court's jurisdiction had been misused.Conversely, the respondents' counsel argued that there was no illegality in the judgments, and the matter fell under the Family Court's jurisdiction.After reviewing the arguments and the evidence, the judge observed that the proceedings before the Arbitration Council, as per Section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, were an additional legal remedy and did not prevent the suit from being filed in the Family Court. The judge found that the petitioner's contentions were baseless.The judge also ruled on the claims for dower, gold ornaments, and maintenance. Dower and gold ornaments claims were granted, and the maintenance amount was deemed justified. As a result, the petitioner's appeal was dismissed, and the judgment of the Family Court was upheld.In conclusion, the court dismissed Shabbir Ahmad's petition and upheld the judgments of the lower courts.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner's argument revolved around the Shia personal law, stating that divorce under Shia law requires specific Arabic sentences (Seeghajaat) to be read in the presence of two witnesses. He referred to an amendment in Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which stipulated the divorce process for Shia Muslims, emphasizing the importance of pronouncing Talaq in Arabic words in the presence of witnesses.The court considered various precedents and established that under Shia law, the divorce becomes effective when Seeghajaat are read in the presence of witnesses, and the presence of the wife is not mandatory. The court also cited past cases where it was established that Talaq must conform to Shia law's requirements to be valid.In conclusion, the court found that the divorce pronounced by the respondent No.1 did not comply with Shia law's requirements, as it did not involve the reading of Seeghajaat in the presence of witnesses. Therefore, the divorce was not valid under Shia law. The court advised the petitioner to pronounce a fresh Talaq in accordance with Shia law, and the matter should be handled accordingly. The writ petition was disposed of based on these findings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case's background involved a suit filed by Shazia Khurram and others for the recovery of maintenance allowance against Khurram Ghulam Rasool. On the same day, they also filed an application under Section 21-A of the Act, obtaining a stay order on Rasool's property. Rasool contested the suit, and subsequently, the family court issued the impugned order.The petitioner's argument centered on the timing and necessity of the restraining order under Section 21-A of the Act. He claimed that such an order should only be issued after an interim or final decree and argued that the court had not followed proper procedure. Additionally, he asserted that the application had been filed prematurely, without sufficient evidence of his intent to sell the property.The Assistant Attorney General for Pakistan argued that while the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) does not apply directly to proceedings under the Act, CPC principles can be applied when the Act is silent on certain matters.The judgment emphasized that Section 21-A of the Act should be exercised sparingly and in strict accordance with the law. The court found that the family court had passed the restraining order hastily, based on presumptions and apprehensions rather than concrete evidence of Rasool's intent to sell the property. The court set aside the impugned order, concluding that it was not justified in the given circumstances.The judgment underscored the importance of proving the intent to dispose of property with evidence, and that mere claims or apprehensions are insufficient to pass a restraining order under Section 21-A of the Act.",

witnesses---Scope---Accused was charged for committing murder of fatherof complainant by firing---Ocular account of the incident had been furnished bycomplainant/son and widow of the deceased---Complainant mostly reiterated the contents ofhis fard-e-bayan, wherein he had stated that on the day of occurrence, he along with his otherfamily members were present in his house, when the door of the house was knocked by theaccused deceased was prohibited by his mother not to go to the door due to extremeannoyance of accused but despite that deceased went out of, where scuffle took place---Complainant came out from his house, after hearing fire shot and found his father lying inthe pool of blood, while the accused holding pistol in his hand escaped from the place ofoccurrence in a motorcycle---Complainant contradicted his statement as contained in thefard-e-bayan, where he mentioned that on the way to the hospital his father succumbed to theinjuries, while in his court statement he stated that doctor after examination disclosed that hisfather had died---According to complainant at the relevant time the neighbours were gatheredat the spot but neither any neighbour was interrogated nor produced in the Trial Court by theprosecution---Prosecution had failed to produce the persons who had taken the deceased tohospital---Widow of the deceased also contradicted the statement of complainant and statedthat initially her husband was being shifted to a private hospital from where he was beingtaken to civil hospital but on the way to civil hospital he succumbed to the injuries---Widowof deceased in her cross-examination stated that complainant disclosed to her that initiallythe deceased was shifted to private hospital in injured condition and thereafter he was takento civil hospital---Statements of both the said witnesses had fully been contradicted byanother witness, who claimed to be the witness of disclosure of the accused recorded duringinvestigation, wherein allegedly the accused had not only confessed his guilt but also gotrecovered the crime weapon from the roof of the house of deceased---Statements of both thewitnesses were silent that the accused had thrown the pistol on their roof rather they in aspecific terms stated that the accused while holding the pistol escaped from the place ofoccurrence on a motorcycle---Comparative study of both the statements of complainant andwidow and the statement of other witness made the presence of both the witnesses doubtfulat the relevant time and also the recovery of crime weapon on the pointation was doubtful---Circumstances established that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against theaccused beyond any shadow of doubt---Appeal against conviction was allowed, incircumstances.(b) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)-------S. 302(b)---Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984), Art. 40---Qatl-i-amd---Appreciation ofevidence---Benefit of doubt---Delay in disclosure made by the witness---Scope--- Accusedwas charged for committing murder of father of complainant by firing---In the present case, awitness had claimed to be the witness of disclosure of the accused recorded duringinvestigation, wherein allegedly the accused had not only confessed his guilt, but also gotrecovered the crime weapon from the roof of the house of deceased---Record showed that thealleged recovery of crime weapon was effected after 20-days of incident from the roof of thehouse of complainant party, thus, it was beyond imagination that the said pistol remained onthe roof of complainant party and no one had seen it and even after 20-days its condition wasnot deteriorated---Even otherwise, the Investigating Officer admitted in his crossexamination that the alleged recovery of pistol was not effected in his presence---Circumstances established that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against theaccused beyond any shadow of doubt---Appeal against conviction was allowed, incircumstances.(c) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)-------S. 302(b)---Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984), Art. 40---Qatl-i-amd---Appreciation ofevidence---Benefit of doubt--- Accused was charged for committing murder of father ofcomplainant by firing---In the present case, both the complainant and widow of deceased inspecific terms stated in their statements that on hearing the firing shots, when they came outfrom their house, they had seen the accused holding pistol in his hand---Admittedly both thesaid witnesses were also on the target of accused, but he let them free and escaped from theplace of occurrence---Said fact did not appeal to the logic that by killing a person in presenceof his blood relations, the accused being armed with sophisticated weapon would not attemptto cause any injury/kill the prosecution witnesses leaving them for evidence to be hanged---Ocular testimony of the related/interested prosecution witnesses and false implication of theaccused by the witnesses could not be ruled out of consideration as the accused whilerecording his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., had taken specific plea of his false implicationby witnesses---Circumstances established that

Nazir Ahmad appealed to the District Judge, but the appeal was also dismissed, leading to the filing of this revision petition. The petitioners argued that the lower courts had made mistakes in their assessment of the alleged partition deed (Ex.P-1) and that the evidence supported its existence.The Lahore High Court reviewed the judgments and decrees of the lower courts and found that they had upheld the trial court's findings. The court noted issues with Ex.P-1, including the fact that it had not been affirmed by a Revenue Officer, as required by the law. Ultimately, the Lahore High Court concluded that there were no legal errors or irregularities in the lower courts' judgments and decrees. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the law and considered the evidence. Therefore, the revision petition was dismissed, and no costs were awarded to either party.",

The complainant, claimed that his son had gone missing, and witnesses reported seeing the accused with Irfan Haider. However, the Lahore High Court questioned the credibility of the witnesses, particularly one who was a close relative of the complainant and had failed to inform the family about seeing Irfan Haider with the accused. Additionally, the court raised doubts about the alleged extra-judicial confessions, considering them weak evidence without sufficient corroboration. The Lahore High Court concluded that the prosecution's circumstantial evidence did not inspire confidence and lacked the necessary corroboration. The court emphasized the importance of reliable evidence in criminal cases, especially when based on circumstantial evidence. As a result, the appeal was dismissed as devoid of merit, upholding the acquittal of the respondents. Court rejected the appeal against the acquittal of the respondents, highlighting weaknesses in the prosecution's case and emphasizing the need for reliable evidence in criminal proceedings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal allowed---The Accountability Court had convicted and sentenced the appellant under Section 10 of the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, to 8 years of rigorous imprisonment along with fines. The accusations revolved around his accumulation of substantial assets and properties that appeared to be disproportionate to his known sources of income. As a result, an investigation was conducted, which uncovered various assets, including foreign exchange certificates, properties, and bank accounts held by the appellant and his family members. It was found that these assets were obtained through corrupt practices and corruption, which led to the charges and convictions. The appellants were charged under Section 10 of the NAB Ordinance for corruption and corrupt practices due to their disproportionate wealth.The appellant, denied the allegations against him, particularly related to a deposit of US Dollars 1,27,277 by his family members in Deutsche Bank for obtaining a loan of Rs. 8.6 million. He claimed that the amount was from legitimate sources and used to adjust a loan in a Pak rupee account. Another appellant, also denied the allegations, stating that he was falsely implicated by the investigating officer. The defense raised several contentions, including defects in the framing of charges, improper conduct of the investigation, and failure to fulfill legal requirements in questioning the accused. They also argued that the prosecution did not establish that the assets of the accused were beyond their known sources of income. The court noted that the charges were defectively framed, and it was not clear from the prosecution's case that the accused had to explain the source of their income beyond the known sources. The court emphasized that the burden of proving the known source of income primarily falls on the prosecution before shifting to the accused to explain their resources. The court found that there was a lack of evidence regarding the misuse of authority by the accused to earn ill-gotten money or to build up assets illegally. Additionally, the prosecution did not adequately address the known source of income of the accused. The court also highlighted that the prosecution failed to provide any order by the Chairman of NAB declaring two witnesses as approvers, a requirement under the law. The court ultimately found legal deficiencies in the case and emphasized the need for the prosecution to prove the known source of income before shifting the burden to the accused. The court found that the prosecution failed to establish a clear connection between the properties and ill-gotten money, and there was insufficient evidence to support the forfeiture of these assets. The court also criticized the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for not properly investigating the sources of funds used to purchase these properties and emphasized the importance of transparently probing corruption to benefit national interests. Ultimately, the appeals were allowed, the conviction was overturned, and the properties were released. The appellants were acquitted, and their bail sureties were discharged.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail denied---CrPC allowed an accused person to seek post-arrest bail if they have been in custody for more than two years continuously and if they are not considered a hardened, desperate, or dangerous criminal. The case involved an honor killing, where the petitioner was implicated in the murder of his own daughter. The court considered whether the act of killing one's own daughter in the name of honor constituted an act of a desperate and dangerous criminal. The court observed that such acts, where family members are involved in honor killings, must be strongly condemned. Granting post-arrest bail in such cases could lead to an increase in such incidents, and it would not be in line with the principles of justice and protecting women's rights. In this particular case, the girl had been murdered for contracting a marriage of her choice, and the court noted the brutal nature of the crime. Consequently, the court refused to grant post-arrest bail to the petitioner, stating that doing so would not be in the interest of justice. The petitioner's request for post-arrest bail was dismissed, and the court upheld the principle that honor killings should not be tolerated in society.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner claimed that at the time of her marriage to respondent No.3, she brought dowry articles worth Rs. 2,64,800/-, including gold ornaments and other items. The lower courts awarded Rs. 70,000/- as the alternate price for the dowry articles, considering wear and tear and the financial status of the petitioner's parents. The petitioner argued that the valuation of the dowry articles was too low, given the short duration of the marriage. The respondent's counsel countered by stating that a buffalo was given to the petitioner's parents in exchange for the dowry articles. The High Court noted that wear and tear on dowry articles depended on various factors, including the nature and quality of the items, their use, the relationship between the spouses, and the period of use. The court stated that there is no generalized formula to determine wear and tear precisely. It suggested methods for ascertaining wear and tear, such as physical verification through video calls, video footage, photographs, or employing modern technology. The court also recommended the appointment of a local commission for verification. Ultimately, the High Court allowed the writ petition, setting aside the previous judgments and directing the Family Court to reassess the tentative value of the dowry articles using one of the suggested methods.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Dowry articles were allegedly given to respondent No.2, but a suit for the recovery of these articles was filed in 2002 after respondent No.2 was ousted from the petitioner's house. Additionally, respondent No.2 had filed an application for the custody of their minor children. After a series of legal proceedings, including the Family Court's decision to grant the petitioner a decree for dowry articles to the extent of a specific list, the matter was appealed. The petitioner's counsel argued that the appellate court should not have granted the full dowry articles without proper evidence, while respondent No.2's counsel contended that some items were admitted by the petitioner and therefore should be considered part of the dowry. The court found that the burden of proof regarding the return of dowry articles lay with the petitioner and that some of the dowry articles were indeed not retained by them, as per their written statement. The court excluded the claim for 25-tolas of gold ornaments but included a television and sewing machine in the list of dowry articles or set their tentative value at Rs. 1,00,000. This legal case involved a dispute over dowry articles and custody of minors, ultimately resulting in the adjustment of the dowry articles claimed by the parties involved in the case.",

The incident occurred when the deceased was traveling on a motorcycle, and he was shot by the appellants with firearms. The motive behind the murder is related to a land dispute between the complainant's family and the appellants. The judgment sheet details the witness testimonies, medical evidence related to the injuries sustained by the deceased, and the identification parade of the appellants. In this judgment, the Lahore High Court appears to have considered the evidence and upheld the convictions and sentences of the appellants, with Qamar Abbas alias Qamru and Dildar alias Dilu sentenced to death, and Muhammad Azam and Shahid Ali sentenced to life imprisonment. The appellants were also ordered to pay compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased. The judgment sheet provides an overview of the key aspects of the case and the legal proceedings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner claimed that these dowry articles were given at the time of her marriage to the respondent, but she was later turned out by him, and he retained the dowry articles. Initially, the Family Court had awarded a monthly maintenance allowance to Kalsoom Bibi and her child, along with maternity charges and the recovery of dowry articles or their price. However, the respondent filed an appeal, and the appellate court set aside the recovery of dowry articles while upholding the maintenance allowance. In this constitutional petition, the petitioner argued that she had provided substantial evidence regarding the financial status of the respondent, the description of the dowry articles, and the cultural custom of giving dowry. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and noted that the respondent's defense was primarily an evasive denial. The petitioner and her father provided details about the dowry articles, and her father testified about his financial capacity to provide dowry. The court also considered the number of guests at the wedding and the custom of giving dowry in rural societies. Ultimately, the court reversed the findings of the appellate court, holding that the list of dowry articles (Ex-P1) was sufficient evidence, and the absence of receipts was not unusual in rural societies. The court decreed the suit for the recovery of dowry articles or their price at Rs. 1,00,000/- while upholding the maintenance allowance awarded by the Family Court.",

However, their relationship deteriorated, and respondent No.2 contracted a second marriage. The petitioner had previously filed various legal actions, including a suit for maintenance allowance and dowry articles, as well as appeals and writ petitions related to these matters. The main point of contention in this document is whether a DNA test is necessary to determine the parentage of Muhammad Umair Tayyab, who is now over 18 years old. The document cited relevant legal provisions, including Section 128 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which deals with the presumption of legitimacy of a child born during a valid marriage. The document also references previous legal cases and their implications for the use of DNA tests in such situations. Ultimately, the document concluded by allowing the writ petition, setting aside the order for a DNA test, and directing the parties to continue their case before the learned Judge Family Court, where it is still pending.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In this case, Wahab Ahmad challenges the validity of an order from the Family Court, Lahore, which allowed the respondent's application to include the names of witnesses in the list and record their evidence. The petitioner argues that the respondent did not initially include these witnesses in the list appended with the plaint, hence claiming that such an application is not maintainable under the Family Courts Act, 1964.The judgment delves into the interpretation of Section 7 of The Family Courts Act, 1964, stating that the provision allows for the calling of witnesses at a later stage with the court's permission, if deemed necessary in the interest of justice. The judgment highlights that the Act doesn't specify consequences for non-compliance, implying a discretionary aspect for the court to decide the matter based on the requirement of justice.The judgment also distinguishes the application of The Family Courts Act, 1964 from the Civil Procedure Code, emphasizing the discretion vested with the Family Court. It cites previous cases supporting the court's power to permit the inclusion of witnesses even if not initially listed, provided it serves the interest of justice.Ultimately, the judgment rules that the impugned order was passed in the interest of justice and did not prejudice either side. Hence, the writ petition is dismissed, indicating that the order in question is an interim one and not illegally prejudicial to warrant intervention via constitutional jurisdiction.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The incident took place on January 15, 2007, where three to four young boys fired upon Zohaib Gondal, the complainant, and his family, resulting in the death of Tariq Mehmood. The accused were charged with murder and other related offenses.During the trial, the witnesses' accounts were inconsistent and lacked credibility. The identification parade proceedings were also flawed, with some witnesses not being able to identify the accused. The recovery of weapons and other evidence from the accused was questionable, as they were allegedly kept in illegal custody prior to the arrests.Based on these doubts and contradictions in the prosecution's case, the Lahore High Court acquitted all the appellants, setting aside their convictions and sentences. The court held that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the appellants were acquitted of the charges. The death sentence awarded to Shoaib Habib and Saqlain Abbas was not confirmed, and they were ordered to be released if not required in any other case.",

The petitioner's argument was based on a contradiction in the respondent's pleadings and statements. However, the petitioner argued that the respondent had left these ornaments at his house when she went to her parents' house. The petitioner contended that the trial court did not frame the issue properly, and as a result, the evidence was not properly focused on the dispute regarding the quantity and possession of the gold ornaments. The Lahore High Court found that this was indeed a case of misreading of evidence and that the issue was not framed properly, leading to incorrect findings. The court cited a precedent that stated that a writ of \"Certiorari\" could be issued in cases where findings of fact were based on legally inadmissible evidence, where admissible evidence was not accepted, or where findings were not supported by any evidence at all. As a result, the court set aside both orders below relating to the issue of gold ornaments and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to reframe the issue and decide the case within two months. However, the issue of maintenance was not found to have jurisdictional defects or errors of law, so the petition was dismissed in that regard.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner, Matloob Qadir, filed a special leave to appeal against the judgment dated 18.10.2010 passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class, Gujrat, wherein the accused/respondents No.1 to 6 were acquitted of charges under sections 440/506/148/149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in connection with a private complaint.The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner alleged that the respondents, along with their co-accused, demolished a room on his property and raised their own construction while also threatening his family. The trial court summoned the respondents, but some absented themselves and were declared proclaimed offenders. After a trial, the respondents were acquitted by the learned Magistrate.In the Lahore High Court, the only argument put forth by the petitioner's counsel was that the trial court wrongly focused on the issue of possession while acquitting the respondents of the charge under section 440 PPC. However, the judge, after reviewing the evidence and arguments, was not convinced. The judge stated that the possession of the property was continuously with the respondents, and the petitioner's ownership was yet to be decided in the civil litigation pending between the parties. Without establishing wrongful loss or damage caused by the respondents, the charge of mischief under section 440 PPC could not be proven. The judge upheld the trial court's judgment, refused leave to appeal, and dismissed the petition as devoid of merits.",

Appeal No. 1825 of 2010 involves Razia Sultana, who was tried by the Special Court, CNS, Lahore, in a case registered under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. She was accused of possessing narcotics, including 10 kilograms of charas on her person and facilitating the recovery of additional charas, gardacharas, and opium from her residential room.During the trial, formal charges were framed against the accused, and the prosecution presented four witnesses, including police officers and the Investigating Officer, to establish the charges. The appellant denied the allegations, claiming that the raid was originally meant for her tenant, Muhammad Akram, who escaped during the operation. She further accused the Investigating Officer of falsely implicating her.The defense raised several contentions, including the legality and validity of the recovery proceedings, lack of search warrants, and the alleged involvement of other family members residing in the house where the recovery took place. The defense also challenged the absence of a crucial witness, Imtiaz Hussain Constable, who was responsible for transmitting samples to the Chemical Examiner's office.However, the court found the prosecution's evidence convincing and the defense's claims unproven. The court upheld the trial court's judgment, dismissing the appeal, and concluded that the appellant's involvement in the offense was established beyond doubt. The conviction and sentence were upheld.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Factors determining jurisdiction of Family Court with regard to service of defendant and grant of maintenance----The background of the case involved respondents No. 3 to 5 filing a suit for the recovery of maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and gold ornaments in the Family Court in Ferozewala. Despite various notices and publications, Muhammad Fazal Rasool, the petitioner, did not participate in the proceedings. As a result, he was proceeded against ex parte, and the court issued judgments and decrees in favor of the respondents. The petitioner later filed an application to set aside these judgments and decrees, which was ultimately dismissed.The petitioner argued that the suit and judgments against him were obtained through improper means and that he was not properly served with notices. He also claimed that he was divorced from respondent No. 3 before the suit was filed. However, the court found that the petitioner's address was correctly mentioned in various documents, including the Nikahnama and the application he filed himself. The court also concluded that the petitioner had opportunities to defend himself but deliberately chose not to participate in the proceedings.Ultimately, the court dismissed the petition and ordered that an amount deposited by the petitioner be released to respondent No. 3 for the maintenance of the minors. The court noted that the petitioner had not paid any maintenance despite the previous judgments and decrees in favor of respondent No. 3.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Defamation & perjury route differently for trial; concept of judicial proceeding during investigation --- The case involves Sumera Rasheed, the petitioner, seeking special leave to appeal against the acquittal of Abida Shahid and Muhammad Sajjad (respondents No.2 & 3) in a private complaint under sections 500, 193, 195, 196, 211, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The petitioner alleges defamation and malicious prosecution due to false accusations made in an FIR related to a property dispute.Abdul Razaq, Sumera Rasheed's husband, had purchased two plots in Evergreen Housing Colony, Haroon Abad. The dispute arose when suspicions arose that the plot was sold to multiple individuals by Shahid Iqbal, the owner of the colony. Legal actions were taken, including securing status quo through a civil court and a subsequent FIR against the petitioner's family.The petitioner contends that the lower court's order, dated 15.12.2022, under section 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which led to the acquittal of the respondents, was not correctly interpreted. The petitioner's counsel argues that the lower court failed to appreciate the law, emphasizing that statements made during investigation also constitute giving or fabricating false evidence.The prosecutor counters, citing section 502-A of the PPC, which grants the Court of Session the authority to entertain complaints directly, and that other offenses can be tried along with the offense under section 500 PPC.The judge, after reviewing the legal arguments, discusses the nature of perjury and the distinctions between lying and perjury. The judge emphasizes that the mode of trial is a crucial aspect, questioning whether offenses under sections 193/195/196/211 PPC can be tried along with section 500 PPC.The judge concludes that the lower court's order was justified, dismissing the special leave to appeal and declining leave to appeal. The decision is based on the understanding that statements made during the investigation, at this premature stage, cannot be the basis for defamation, and the lower court correctly applied the law.The detailed order delves into legal interpretations, emphasizing the importance of eradicating perjury and ensuring justice. The judge expresses concern about the manipulation of cases by powerful elites and the need for a study to understand how cases are structured with the help of police.",

The Family Court consolidated the suits and framed several issues to be addressed.After evaluating evidence from both parties, the Family Court dismissed the Petitioner's suit and decreed the Respondent's suit, granting her 120 Tolas silver ornaments, Rs. 1,500,000/- as dower, Rs. 10,000/- per month as pocket money, Rs. 10,000/- per month as maintenance allowance, and dowry articles.The Petitioner challenged the judgment, arguing that the maintenance allowance and pocket money were excessive, the dower had been paid through a cheque, and the value of dowry articles was wrongly determined.The judgment provides a detailed analysis of the evidence, concluding that the Petitioner failed to prove the payment of dower through a cheque and that the Respondent was entitled to the decreed amounts. The court also notes the dissolution of marriage between the parties and upholds the decision to relinquish 25% of the prompt dower as part of the divorce proceedings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Against order of acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C. criminal revision under section 439, Cr.P.C. is not competent. Similarly, writ petition against order of acquittal is also not competent in the light of section 417(2), Cr.P.C. --- The petitioner, Hajra Javaid Makhdoom, initiated the petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, seeking redress, specifically requesting a retrial and criminal revision in a case involving the respondent, Muhammad Tehmas Nasir.The petitioner's grievance revolved around a private complaint filed under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, alleging that the respondent had contracted a second marriage without her consent. Subsequently, the Judicial Magistrate in Sargodha summoned the respondent to face trial under section 6(5) of the Ordinance. However, during the proceedings, the respondent submitted an application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., contending that the petitioner's complaint was baseless and driven by ulterior motives.The magistrate accepted the respondent's application, leading the petitioner to file a criminal revision. This revision was later dismissed by the Additional Sessions Judge. The petitioner, dissatisfied with both decisions, filed the present writ petition, urging the Lahore High Court to refer the case back to the Judicial Magistrate for retrial and the criminal revision back to the Additional Sessions Judge.In the judgment dated December 19, 2023, Judge Muhammad Tariq Nadeem meticulously examined the legal aspects raised in the petition. The judge acknowledged the petitioner's contention that against an order of acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., a criminal revision was competent, citing \"The State through Advocate-General, Sindh High Court of Karachi v. Raja Abdul Rehman\" (2005 SCMR 1544) as a precedent.However, Judge Nadeem went on to analyze the relevant legal provisions, emphasizing section 417(2), Cr.P.C., which stipulates that an appeal lies against an order of acquittal. The judge observed that the petitioner had not satisfactorily addressed whether the order of acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., was amenable to criminal revision or could be challenged through a petition for special leave to appeal under section 417(2), Cr.P.C.The judgment delved into the interplay between sections 439, 439-A, and 417(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, clarifying that while an appeal could be filed against an order of acquittal, no proceedings by way of revision could be entertained if an appeal was available. Additionally, the judgment underscored the distinction between criminal appeals and revisions, highlighting that a revision against an order of acquittal was not competent under section 439(4)(a), Cr.P.C.Judge Nadeem concluded that the criminal revision before the court of the Additional Sessions Judge was not competent, as the order of acquittal could only be challenged through the remedy provided in section 417(2), Cr.P.C. The judge dismissed the writ petition, asserting that a constitutional petition was not maintainable when a specific alternate remedy of appeal against acquittal existed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court to challenge the orders dated 03.06.2022 and 31.10.2023 passed by the Judge Family Court, Lahore, and the Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, respectively. The petitioner filed a complaint under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, accusing respondent Feroz Usmani of contracting a second marriage without permission while still married to her. Other respondents were accused of facilitating the marriage. ----Issues: 1- Whether the complaint against the remaining respondents, aside from Feroz Usmani, disclosed any offense under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. 2- Whether the trial court and the additional sessions court erred in dismissing the complaint against the other respondents. 3- Whether the orders passed by the courts below are in accordance with the law and facts of the case. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: ---Application of Mind by the Magistrate: The Additional Sessions Judge emphasized that the magistrate must be satisfied that a trial is necessary based on the available record before issuing a process to summon the respondents. The court found that no incriminating material was available on record against the respondents, except for Feroz Usmani. ---Strict Interpretation of Criminal Statutes: The court noted that the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, specifically Section 6(5), does not prescribe any offense or penalty against anyone other than the husband who contracts another marriage without permission from the Arbitration Council. The ordinance does not provide for any inchoate offenses such as attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy in relation to polygamy. ---Evidence and Cursory Statements: The complaint and cursory statements did not provide sufficient material to justify summoning the other respondents. The evidence provided by the petitioner was deemed insufficient to establish a prima facie case against them. ---Non-Applicability of Pakistan Penal Code: The court held that, being a special statute, the provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, such as Section 109 for abetment, cannot be read into the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance to broaden the scope of the offense prescribed under Section 6(5). The Lahore High Court dismissed the writ petition, finding no illegality or jurisdictional error in the orders passed by the Family Court and the Additional Sessions Judge. The complaint against respondents other than Feroz Usmani did not disclose any offense under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. The petition was dismissed in limine for being devoid of merit. -----Citations/Precedents: Mirza Shaukat Baig and others vs. Shahid Jamil and others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 530) Ex-Lance Naik Mukarram Hussain and others v.

The Court critiques journalists for lack of due diligence, emphasizing the need for fairness and objectivity in reporting. --- The Court, while not making a final judgment on guilt, concludes that the judiciary's integrity remains intact. Malik Riaz's admission that no favors were granted dispels doubts cast on the Court. The case highlights the importance of due diligence in media reporting and the need for discretion in private and public dealings, especially for family members of public functionaries. the Court urged the Attorney General to pursue legal action against individuals involved in any illegal acts, emphasizing the rule of law.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Procedural History:Akram's conviction under Section 302(a) PPC for his wife's murder was modified by the Supreme Appellate Court to Section 308 PPC, with the sentence altered to fourteen years of rigorous imprisonment and an order to pay Diyat of Rs. 1,70,000. His sentences were directed to run consecutively. Akram sought to have his sentences run concurrently through a writ petition at the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, which was granted. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court.---Issue:The main issue was whether the sentences awarded to Akram for the murder of his family members should run consecutively or concurrently.---Judgment:The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the Lahore High Court's judgment that allowed the sentences to run concurrently.---Reasoning:The Supreme Court emphasized that the discretion to direct sentences to run consecutively or concurrently must be exercised based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the nature of the offense, and its gravity. The Court found it unreasonable for the Lahore High Court to have exercised its writ jurisdiction to alter the conditionality of the sentences for such heinous crimes. The Supreme Court also noted that the precedents relied upon by the Lahore High Court were reviewed and upheld by a larger bench, reinforcing the principle of not offering leniency for grave offenses.Citations and Precedents:The judgment referenced several key cases to support its decision, including:Javed Shaikh v. The State (1985 SCMR 153)Shah Muhammad alias Manna v. State (1994 SCMR 582)Bashir v. The State (PLD 1991 SC 1145)Muhammad Arshad v. The State (PLD 2011 SC 310)Ali Khan Kakar v. Hammad Abbasi (2012 SCMR 334)The Court also ordered that the deposited Diyat amount of Rs. 8,50,000 by Akram be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased, as mandated by law.Conclusion:The Supreme Court's decision underscores the judiciary's stance on not mitigating the sentences for severe crimes, particularly those involving the murder of family members, and reaffirms the principle that sentences should reflect the gravity of the offense.Court: ''The discretionary power vested in the Court to direct that the awarded sentences shall run consecutively or concurrently is to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances of each case, keeping in view the scope of section 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908, the nature and manner of occurrence and the gravity of the offence. Thus, it seems quite strange and unreasonable that through impugned judgment, the learned Division Bench of the High Court had done away with the conditionality of such sentences to run consecutively while exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, which is equitable and discretionary in nature and not meant to give premium to a criminal for commission of heinous crime.''",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal --- '' suspicion howsoever grave or strong can never be a proper substitute for proof beyond treasonable doubt required in a criminal case'' --- Background:Muhammad Jamshaid was convicted for the murder of Mirza Yaqoob under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (P.P.C.) read with section 34 P.P.C., and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine by the Additional Sessions Judge, Rawalpindi, on December 4, 2006. The Lahore High Court upheld this conviction on June 6, 2011. Jamshaid appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which granted leave to appeal on December 14, 2012.--- Issue: Whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamshaid was guilty of the murder of Mirza Yaqoob.---- Holding: The Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed the appeal, setting aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted Muhammad Jamshaid, granting him the benefit of the doubt.---Reasoning:The Supreme Court observed that the murder was unwitnessed and the prosecution's motive was disbelieved by the trial court. The primary evidence against Jamshaid was the discovery of Yaqoob's body in his house, which was also inhabited by other family members. The Supreme Court found this approach by the lower courts speculative, emphasizing that suspicion, however grave, cannot substitute for the proof required in a criminal case. The Court noted the absence of evidence directly linking Jamshaid to the murder and criticized the lower courts for concluding that the prosecution had met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.---Conclusion:The Supreme Court highlighted the need for courts to rely on concrete evidence rather than speculation in criminal cases. By acquitting Jamshaid due to the lack of direct evidence against him, the Court underscored the principle that the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, a cornerstone of criminal jurisprudence.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Issue:The primary issue was whether the lower courts erred in their judgment by partially decreeing the claim for dowry articles in favor of the respondent, considering the petitioner's objections related to the evidence and procedural aspects of the trial.---Rule:The legal framework for family suits, which is distinct from the Civil Procedure Code (C.P.C) and Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, was considered alongside principles governing the representation in court, evidence assessment, and the role of the appellate court in reviewing findings from lower courts.---Analysis:The court examined the evidence presented, including testimonies from both parties and witnesses. It noted inconsistencies in the petitioner's claims regarding the return of dowry articles through a 'panchiat' (community council) and the absence of written proof for such return. The court found no misreading, non-reading, or illegality in the impugned judgments and emphasized that the appraisal of evidence is primarily the function of the Family Court. The court also addressed the petitioner's objection regarding the non-appearance of the respondent in person, stating that her representation by a special attorney who withstood cross-examination was sufficient, and the procedural norms for family suits do not necessitate the personal appearance of the claimant.---Conclusion:The Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, dismissed the petition for lack of merit, upholding the concurrent findings of the lower courts regarding the partial decree for the recovery of dowry articles in favor of the respondent.",

The court reasoned that:The jurisdiction for divorce matters lies with the Union Council where the wife was residing at the time of the divorce pronouncement. In this case, both the petitioner and his wife were residing in Germany, placing the jurisdiction with the Pakistani Mission in Germany as per S.R.O.No.1086(K)61.The Islamabad High Court's ruling striking down the S.R.O. does not affect its applicability in Punjab, as judicial decisions are confined to the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing court.----Conclusion:The Lahore High Court found that the Union Council in Lahore lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner's divorce proceedings, given the couple's residence in Germany. The court upheld the procedural requirements and jurisdictional mandates of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and associated rules, leading to the dismissal of the petition for a divorce effectiveness certificate.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The original suit filed by Mat. Zebun Nisa and her daughter sought declaration for their shares in the property against their dower and legal/sharia rights, respectively. The defendants resisted the suit, leading to multiple remands and the eventual dismissal of the suit.---Issue:Whether the offer by plaintiff No.1 (Mat. Zebun Nisa) to resolve the dispute through an oath on the Holy Quran and the subsequent acceptance and fulfillment of this offer by the defendants barred plaintiff No.1 from pursuing her claim further?Whether plaintiff No.2 (Ms. Hurmat) had a competent claim to her share in the property during the lifetime of Muhammad Sherin (her grandfather), given the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961?---Holding:The court held that plaintiff No.1 was estopped from pressing her claim further due to her offer to resolve the dispute through an oath, which was accepted and fulfilled by the defendants.The court found plaintiff No.2's claim to be incompetent and premature, as she had no locus standi to claim her share in the property during the lifetime of her grandfather, Muhammad Sherin.--Reasoning:The court reasoned that the principle of estoppel and the doctrine of election barred plaintiff No.1 from retracting her offer, which was duly accepted and fulfilled by the defendants. Additionally, the court referenced multiple precedents, including the Supreme Court cases, to reinforce the doctrines of estoppel, election, and the rights of property owners to alienate their property. For plaintiff No.2, the court noted that the suit was filed during the lifetime of Muhammad Sherin, making her claim for a share in his property incompetent and premature, as her legal right to inheritance had not yet materialized.---Rule of Law:The judgment relied on the principles of estoppel and election to bar claims that have been resolved by mutual agreement or where the claimant has made a definitive choice in resolving a dispute. It also emphasized the legal right of a property owner to alienate their property and the timing of inheritance claims under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.---Precedents relied by the court: Stir Miviib-Rehman Muhammad Hassani Washuk and others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 718): This case established that once a litigant has chosen a certain course of action or abandoned a particular plea, they cannot reopen the matter simply because the initial choice did not yield favorable results.---Silver Star Insurance Company Limited Lahore through Chief Executive Vs. Messrs Kamal Pipes Industries, Lahore and another (2028 CLD 1342, Lahore): This case likely deals with the principles of estoppel and/or the finality of decisions made based on chosen remedies.---Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Vs. Devan Sugar Mills Limited and others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 828): This case might discuss the implications of legal choices and the consequences of such choices on subsequent legal actions.---Lucky Cement Ltd. through Authorized Attorney Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division and 03 others (2021 PTD 835): This precedent might be related to the legal doctrine of estoppel or the principles governing the finality of decisions in commercial or tax-related disputes.----Ghulam Muhammad Vs. Mian Muhammad and another (2007 SCMR 231): This case affirmed the right of a Muslim owner to dispose of their property by way of gift, and such action cannot be contested by the heirs who are deprived of their shares as a result.---Br. Muhammad Javaid Shah Vs. Syed Rashid Arshad and others (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 212): This case likely discusses the principles of estoppel and waiver, particularly in the context of failing to object to a fact or action that could affect one's legal rights.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:This case involves multiple petitions filed by Ibrahim Khan against judgments made by the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench. The High Court had dismissed Ibrahim Khan's writ petition and allowed those filed by Respondent No.1, Mst. Saima Khan. The dispute originated from two suits filed by Mst. Saima Khan in 2014, seeking dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty, recovery of dowry articles, maintenance, and possession of a house or its market value. The trial court decreed dissolution of marriage based on khula, subject to waiver of dower (half portion of the house), awarded maintenance, and partially decreed the recovery of dowry articles. The appellate court later enhanced the maintenance and dowry article costs. Mst. Saima Khan challenged these decisions, arguing that she never sought khula but dissolution on grounds of cruelty and demanded her dower. The High Court agreed, noting evidence that Ibrahim Khan had already divorced her, making the grant of khula unnecessary and upholding her right to dower.Issues:The central issue was whether a court could convert a plea for dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty into a plea for dissolution by khula when khula was not explicitly sought by the wife. Additionally, the case questioned whether Mst. Saima Khan was entitled to dower if the dissolution was based on khula or cruelty.-----Holding/Reasoning:The Supreme Court held that khula is a specific right available to women, which requires explicit consent to waive dower. As Mst. Saima Khan did not seek khula and instead sought dissolution on grounds of cruelty under DMMA, the trial and appellate courts erred in granting khula and making her waive her dower. The Supreme Court found that the High Court's judgment, which recognized that Ibrahim Khan had already divorced Mst. Saima Khan and upheld her right to dower, was in accordance with the law. The Supreme Court also noted that whether through divorce or dissolution on grounds of cruelty, Mst. Saima Khan was entitled to her dower. The factual findings regarding maintenance and dowry articles by the lower courts were not contested for legal interference.------Citations/Precedents:Principles of Mahomedan Law by Dinshah Fardunji Mulla, specifically Paragraph Nos. 319(2) and 320, detailing the concept of khula and its implications on dower.Khurshid Bibi v.

The basis of dismissal was the lack of territorial jurisdiction of the court as the minor was not residing at the address provided in Pakistan but was in the USA with respondent No.3 (Ms. Alina Hasanain, the petitioner's wife).Issues:Whether the trial court had territorial jurisdiction to entertain the Guardians and Wards Applications filed by Syed Raza Ali Shah.The proper legal provisions applicable for determining territorial jurisdiction in matters of guardianship and custody of minors.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court set aside the orders of both the lower courts and remanded the matter to the Court of learned XX-Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate, Karachi South, for a rehearing on the question of territorial jurisdiction. It directed that the jurisdiction should be determined in light of the Family Courts Act, 1964, and the Rules framed thereunder, allowing both parties opportunities to prove their contentions with evidence.

The Court found that the Release Deed was indeed secured through fraud and misrepresentation by Ihtisham-ul-Haq, who was in a dominant position and manipulated his sisters into signing the document under the pretense that it was for the transfer of the property to all legal heirs. The evidence suggested that no consideration was paid to the sisters for relinquishing their shares, nor was there any family settlement to justify the execution of the Release Deed. The Supreme Court emphasized that a release deed and a gift deed are distinct instruments with specific legal requirements, and in this case, the elements of a valid gift were absent. The Court also noted the societal pressures that often lead to female heirs being deprived of their rightful inheritance, reiterating the need to protect vulnerable individuals from such injustices.----Citations/Precedents:Ghulam Ali and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:Pakistan is facing a severe population growth crisis, with its population projected to reach 306 million by 2050 if the current growth rate continues unchecked. This rapid population growth has led to numerous challenges, including poverty, famine, unemployment, high mortality rates, and inadequate access to basic amenities like clean water and education. Despite historical efforts to implement family planning programs, progress has been hindered by factors such as religious opposition and centralization of efforts.---Issues:Whether Pakistan's population growth crisis constitutes a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution?What measures can be taken to address the population growth crisis and promote family planning effectively?---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court held that Pakistan's population growth crisis indeed constitutes a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including the right to life and access to basic amenities. The court reasoned that unchecked population growth undermines the country's socio-economic progress and threatens the well-being of its citizens. To address this crisis, the court recommended various measures, including increasing access to contraceptives, implementing conditional cash transfer schemes for family planning, integrating family planning services into healthcare facilities, and incorporating family planning education into medical and nursing curricula. The court emphasized the urgent need for collaborative efforts from all stakeholders, including government agencies, religious leaders, civil society, and the public, to effectively tackle the population growth crisis.---Citations/Precedents:Proclamation of Teheran, 1968Barrister Zafarullah Khan Vs.

Respondent No.3 filed a suit for the dissolution of marriage and for the return of dowry articles. The suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed, and the marriage was dissolved. Another suit for the return of dowry articles was also decreed, with the amount initially set at Rs. 25,000. Respondent No.3 appealed this decision, and the appellate court enhanced the amount to Rs. 4,00,000.

Section 14(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, curtails the husband's right to appeal if the amount awarded is less than the specified limit. However, this provision does not extinguish the wife's right to appeal if she is dissatisfied with any decree in a suit for dower or dowry.

The incident occurred during a gathering of family elders to settle disputes between Mehboob Alam and his wife, who was the sister of the petitioner. During the gathering, the petitioner allegedly targeted Mehboob Alam with a .30 caliber pistol, resulting in Mehboob Alam's death and the injury of Hakeem Nazeer Ahmad.---Issues:Whether the conviction of the petitioner under section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, and section 324 of the same code is justified.Whether the alteration of the death penalty into imprisonment for life by the High Court is appropriate.Whether the acquittal of Samina Bibi, the petitioner's sister, is justified.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court found that the relationship between the petitioner and the deceased was established. Despite the absence of casings from the crime scene, forensic evidence confirmed the presence of human blood, validating the occurrence of the incident. The autopsy report corroborated the use of the weapon recovered from the petitioner. The prompt reporting and subsequent medical examinations were deemed adequate. Hakeem Nazeer Ahmad, an independent witness, testified to the events and was found credible. The prosecution's evidence, coupled with witness testimony, left no room for doubt regarding the petitioner's guilt. The defense's alternate theories were rejected as unsubstantiated. The courts below were deemed to have acted within the bounds of the law, justifying the conviction and the alteration of the death penalty to life imprisonment. The sentence was considered appropriate.",

The petitioner seeks bail.---Issues:Whether there is sufficient evidence to prima facie frame charges against the petitioner.Whether the petitioner's incarceration is justified pending further evidence and trial.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The petitioner led to the recovery of various items during the investigation, including a mobile phone handset with SIMs and a memory card. However, a forensic examination by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) yielded negative results, failing to link the petitioner to the alleged dissemination of explicit material. The Investigating Officer exonerated the petitioner based on this report.The court found that although there may be animosity between the petitioner and the complainant, independent evidence is required to sustain the charge. The failure of forensic evidence casts doubt on the petitioner's culpability.

The court noted that no inquiry or show cause notice was issued prior to these actions, which was deemed necessary under the law. Furthermore, it was determined that the blocking of CNICs did not fall within the legal powers of the Banking Court as stipulated under the relevant statutes.The Court set aside the impugned order due to these procedural and legal shortcomings and allowed the appeal, remanding the case back to the Executing Court to initiate a fresh process in accordance with the law and the observations made by the High Court.-----Citations/Precedents:Messrs Azhar & Co. and others v.

The petitioners argued that the cases had been improperly assigned to the Family Court, which, as per the Family Courts Act, 1964, should only handle family-related disputes.----Issues:Whether civil cases unrelated to family matters can be legally assigned to a Family Court that primarily handles family disputes under the Family Courts Act, 1964.Whether the transfer of civil cases to the Family Court exceeded the jurisdictional authority granted under the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Lahore High Court allowed the civil revision, setting aside the District Judge's order. The court held that the Family Court, designated under the Family Courts Act, 1964, possesses exclusive jurisdiction to handle only those matters specified within the Act. Civil cases that do not fall under the Act's specified categories cannot be transferred to or decided by the Family Court. The court emphasized that the jurisdictional boundaries set by the Family Courts Act and the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance must be respected, indicating that civil matters unrelated to family issues should be handled by civil courts with general jurisdiction.-----Citations/Precedents:Mian Umar Ikram-Ul-Haque vs. Dr. Shahida Hasnain and another [2016 SCMR 2186]Mirza Daud Baig vs. Additional District Judge, Gujranwala and others [1987 SCMR 1161]Piao Gul vs. The State [PLD 1960 Supreme Court (Pak.) 307]Mst.

These applications were related to disputes over property ownership and possession involving family members. The dispute primarily concerned the legal standing of a gift deed and subsequent possession of a property originally owned by Iftikhar, now deceased. After Iftikhar's death, his brother Muhammad Aijaz (respondent No.1), who was gifted the property, faced opposition from another brother, Niaz Ahmed (applicant No.1), and his wife (applicant No.2).-----Issues:Whether the proceedings under the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 were applicable to a family dispute involving property claimed as inherited.Whether the gift deed favoring Muhammad Aijaz was valid and the subsequent actions taken under it were lawful.Whether the applicants were wrongfully dispossessing Muhammad Aijaz, justifying the enforcement of the Illegal Dispossession Act.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court dismissed the Criminal Revision Applications, upholding the decisions made by the lower court. The court found that the proceedings under the Illegal Dispossession Act were correctly applied despite the familial relationship among the parties. It was emphasized that the Act could be invoked against anyone unlawfully dispossessing or attempting to grab property, not just against external land grabbers or \"Qabza Mafia.\" The court supported the legitimacy of the gift deed granted to Muhammad Aijaz, noting the failure of the applicants to pursue civil remedies effectively, including a dismissed suit challenging the deed.----Citations/Precedents:Mumtaz Hussain vs. Dr. Nasir Khan and others [2010 S C M R 1254]: Discussed the Illegal Dispossession Act?s scope and enforcement.Muhammad Akram and 9 others vs. Muhammad Yousuf and another [2009 SCMR 1066]: Emphasized the mandatory and salutary provisions of the Illegal Dispossession Act.Mst.

It ruled that:Section 12(2) of C.P.C. is applicable in proceedings before Family Courts as per established jurisprudence allowing the general principles of C.P.C. to be applied.The High Court properly exercised its jurisdiction by not interfering with the concurrent factual findings of the lower courts, as such findings were based on substantial evidence indicating misrepresentation in the recall application.Addressing the recall of the decree under Section 7 of the Ordinance, in conjunction with Section 21 of the Act, was deemed unnecessary as the case was decided on the misrepresentation found in the recall application, making further discussion academic.-----Citations/Precedents:Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:This case originated from a property dispute concerning land in Shahpur Town and Jalalpur Jagir, owned by Murid Hussain and Ali Hussain. After their deaths, their respective widows and a third related party held the property as limited owners until the enactment of the West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Act of 1962, which ended the limited ownership. A lawsuit ensued among various family members and heirs, claiming different shares based on traditional and Sharia law. The matter was complicated by various legal claims, including an oral gift and adjustments in property records, leading to multiple legal challenges across several court levels.----Issues:Whether the Appellate and High Courts erred in relying on the death certificate of Mst. Malookan Bibi (Exh.P21) admitted during the appellate stage, which indicated she died before Ali Hussain, thus affecting the distribution of the estate.The admissibility and effect of a compromise deed that was not fully executed or considered by the courts.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the decisions of the Appellate and High Courts. The Court found:The appellate court was justified in admitting the death certificate of Mst. Malookan Bibi as additional evidence under Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code, as it was necessary to clarify the factual dispute regarding the date of her death.The compromise deed executed in 1969 was not given due consideration because it was marked but not exhibited in evidence, and the appellate and High Courts were correct in their treatment of this document.The judgments of the lower courts were based on a proper assessment of the evidence, including the legally admitted death certificate which was decisive in determining the heirs entitled to the estate.----Citations/Precedents:Order XLI, Rule 27, Civil Procedure Code ? Pertains to the conditions under which additional evidence may be admitted at the appellate stage.Evidence Act sections relevant to public documents and certified copies ? These were applied to validate the admission and consideration of the death certificate as a public document.",

The petition challenges the decree that required the petitioners, who are the paternal uncles of the respondent's child, to pay maintenance following the death of the child's father, Muhammad Farooq Ahmad, and grandfather, Muhammad Bashir.---Issues:The primary issue was whether paternal uncles are responsible for providing maintenance to their niece, especially when the child?s father and grandfather are deceased, and the uncles are benefiting from inherited property.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court dismissed the petition, holding that the paternal uncles are responsible for the maintenance of their niece. The reasoning was based on interpretations of Islamic law and previous court decisions, emphasizing that relatives benefiting from an inherited estate have obligations towards other heirs, particularly minors. The court found that the maintenance should be provided from the estate until the minor?s share is duly handed over.----Citations/Precedents:TAHIR MAHMOOD vs. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, BUREWALA and others (PLJ 2024 Lahore (Note) 19)Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants filed an appeal against the judgment of the Additional District Judge/Judge Family Court, Muzaffarabad, dated 04.08.2022. The judgment dismissed their application for adjustment of gold ornaments in the execution of a decree for dower and maintenance allowance filed by the respondent, Mst. Asima Bashir Abbasi. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court erred in dismissing the application for adjustment of gold ornaments in the execution of the decree. 2- Whether the executing court is bound to adhere strictly to the contents of the decree. 3- Whether the judgment and decree regarding the dower and maintenance allowance are final and executable as decreed. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Application for Adjustment of Gold Ornaments: The appellants argued that the trial court should have considered the gold ornaments allegedly taken by the respondent as part of the dower payment. However, the court found that the trial court had only observed that the respondent had taken gold and deposited it in the bank as a surety against a loan. There was no conclusive finding that this gold should be treated as part of the dower payment. --Executing Court's Boundaries: The court reiterated the settled principle that an executing court is bound to execute a final decree in its letter and spirit and cannot deviate from its terms. The executing court correctly followed this principle by dismissing the appellants' application for adjustment of the gold ornaments, as the decree specified the payment of Rs. 5,00,000/- in cash or kind (rooms, bathroom, kitchen), without any mention of the gold ornaments. --Finality of Judgment and Decree: The court noted that the judgment and decree had been appealed and upheld by both this Court and the Supreme Court, thus attaining finality. The executing court was right in observing that any grievance regarding the gold ornaments should be addressed through a separate legal action rather than through the execution proceedings. The court concluded that the appeal lacked merit and was dismissed with no order as to costs. The judgment of the trial court was upheld, and the execution of the decree was to proceed as originally decreed. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2003 Supreme Court (AJ&K) 14 PLD 2011 Lahore 450",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 44 of the AJ&K Interim Constitution, 1974, challenging the order of the Judge Family Court Kotli dated 17.09.2019. The petitioner sought to set aside this order and to direct the Family Court to accept his application and record the remaining evidence of witnesses regarding the correct date of birth of the minor. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court erred in dismissing the petitioner\u2019s application regarding the minor's date of birth. 2- Whether the writ petition is maintainable given the existence of another adequate legal remedy. 3- Whether the Family Court has the jurisdiction to correct entries in birth certificates. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Family Court's Dismissal of Application: The Family Court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application, favoring the respondent\u2019s evidence, which included a NADRA-issued \"Form B\" showing the minor's date of birth as 04.04.2009. The petitioner presented a birth certificate issued by the Municipal Corporation Kotli on 22.07.2006, stating the minor's date of birth as 09.06.2006. The court found the NADRA record to have a presumption of truth unless proven otherwise. --Maintainability of Writ Petition: The court highlighted that writ jurisdiction under Article 44 is not akin to a civil suit and should be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances where no other adequate remedy is available. The petitioner has the option to approach the Civil Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the correct date of birth, making the writ petition unnecessary. --Jurisdiction of Family Court: The court confirmed that the Family Court does not have the authority to correct entries in birth certificates. This responsibility lies within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, which can adjudicate on disputed questions of fact requiring evidence. The court dismissed the writ petition, affirming that the Family Court's order was just and correct. The petitioner was directed to seek resolution of the dispute regarding the date of birth through the Civil Court.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petition for leave to appeal was filed challenging the judgment and decree of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which upheld the dissolution of marriage between the petitioner and respondent. The respondent had filed for dissolution of marriage, citing cruelty, non-payment of dower, and non-performance of marital obligations. ----Issues: Whether the trial court erred in decreeing the dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty, non-payment of dower, and non-performance of marital obligations. Whether the High Court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's appeal was justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court upheld the judgments of the trial court and the High Court, affirming the dissolution of marriage. The petitioner contended that the respondent failed to prove cruelty and other grounds for dissolution. However, the court found that the respondent provided sufficient evidence, including the petitioner's alleged illicit relations with another woman and failure to provide maintenance. The court emphasized that cruelty encompasses mental torture and not just physical abuse. Precedents were cited to support this interpretation. Additionally, the court noted that the petitioner's conduct, including contracting a second marriage, supported the respondent's claims. Furthermore, the court found that the case did not involve a substantial question of law of public importance, as required for an appeal under the Family Courts Act. Precedents were cited to support this point. -----Citations/Precedents: [2018 SCR 1167] (Muhammad Sohrab vs. Sobia Hayat) [2014 SCR 718] (Muhammad Sabil Khan and another v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case involves a dispute over guardianship of a minor, initiated when a guardianship certificate was issued to the appellants. Subsequently, an application for cancellation of the certificate was filed on grounds of fraudulent procurement. The trial court initially entertained the matter but later dismissed it, citing lack of jurisdiction due to the minor's residence abroad. The High Court upheld this decision, prompting the appeal before the Supreme Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for cancellation of the guardianship certificate. 2- Whether the jurisdiction of the court continues even after issuance of a guardianship order. Interpretation of relevant provisions under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and the Family Courts Act, 1993. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for cancellation of the guardianship certificate despite the minor's residence abroad. It reasoned that the court's jurisdiction under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, persists until the minor reaches majority age. Moreover, the introduction of the Family Courts Act, 1993, does not negate this jurisdiction but rather specifies that family courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters including guardianship. Therefore, the trial court's rejection of jurisdiction based on the minor's residence abroad was deemed incorrect. ----Citations/Precedents: Mst. Irshad Bibi vs. M.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: In this case, the Supreme Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir reviewed two criminal appeals arising from a consolidated judgment passed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court. The appeals involved Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti, convicted of murder, theft, and forgery, and Dr. Moheed Pirzada, the complainant, seeking enhancement of the sentence. The underlying incident involved the death of an elderly woman under suspicious circumstances, leading to allegations against her trusted servant, Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction of Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti for the murder of the deceased was justified based on the circumstantial evidence presented. 2- Whether the delay in filing the FIR impacted the credibility of the prosecution's case. 3- Whether the absence of certain procedural formalities and discrepancies in evidence warranted acquittal or a lesser sentence for Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti. 4- Whether the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti should be enhanced to the death penalty. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the conviction of Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti was justified. The prosecution's circumstantial evidence, despite the absence of direct eyewitness testimony, formed a coherent chain linking Bhatti to the crime. His conduct, such as administering drugs to the deceased, misappropriating her funds, and obstructing family contact, supported the prosecution's case. The court found that the delay in filing the FIR did not significantly impact the case's credibility. The FIR was filed after the family conducted preliminary inquiries and became suspicious of Bhatti's actions. The court noted that the delay was reasonably explained by the family's initial shock and subsequent investigation. The court acknowledged minor procedural discrepancies, such as the absence of memos for transported samples and the lack of forensic examination of certain items. However, these were deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction. The overall evidence, including medical reports and witness testimonies, was found credible and consistent. The court declined to enhance Bhatti's sentence to the death penalty. While recognizing the heinous nature of the crime, the court emphasized the principle that life imprisonment is an equally severe and appropriate punishment in cases where mitigating circumstances exist. The court maintained that both death and life imprisonment are normal sentences under section 302(b) of the Azad Penal Code, and the trial court's decision to award life imprisonment was appropriate. -----Citations/Precedents: Khurshid vs. The State [PLD 1996 SC 305] Athar Aziz vs. The State [1996 SCR 225] Abdul Khaliq vs. Jehangir & another [1999 SCR 330] [2001 P.Cr.L.J. 827] Farmanullah vs. Qadeem Khan & another [2001 SCMR 1474] Abdul Rashid & 3 others vs. Abdul Ghaffar & 5 others [2001 P.Cr.L.J. 524] Zar Gul vs. The State [PLJ 2004 Cr.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant filed a civil appeal challenging the judgment and decree of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which upheld the trial court's decision in favor of the respondent. The respondent had filed a suit for the recovery of dowry articles worth Rs. 116,415/- before the Judge Family Court, Mirpur. The trial court decreed in favor of the respondent for Rs. 89,915/- and dismissed the suit for the remaining Rs. 26,500/-. The appellant contested the judgment, claiming that the dowry list was not proven and that no dowry articles were delivered. Issues: 1- Whether the respondent's claim for recovery of dowry articles was sufficiently proven. 2- Whether the list of dowry articles was valid and credible. 3- Whether the judgments of the lower courts contained any misreading or non-reading of evidence. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Recovery of Dowry Articles: The respondent produced two witnesses and documentary evidence, including a list of dowry articles (Ex.PA). The witnesses corroborated the respondent's claim regarding the dowry articles. The appellant, however, denied the delivery of any dowry articles and claimed that the respondent's father received Rs. 65,000/- instead. The court found that the respondent's evidence was credible and sufficient to prove her claim for dowry articles worth Rs. 89,915/-. The court upheld the judgment awarding Rs. 89,915/- worth of dowry articles to the respondent. --Validity of Dowry List: The appellant argued that the dowry list was fabricated as it was not signed or proven with receipts. However, the court noted that there is no legal requirement for documenting dowry articles in such a manner. The court emphasized that in family matters, particularly dowry claims, the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, do not strictly apply, as per the AJ&K Family Courts Act, 1993. The respondent was not required to prove her case with the same rigor as in ordinary civil proceedings. The court found the dowry list (Ex.PA) credible and the respondent's evidence sufficient. --Misreading or Non-Reading of Evidence: The court examined the evidence presented and found that both the trial court and the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court had correctly appraised and appreciated the evidence. There was no misreading or non-reading of the record. The court concluded that the judgments of the lower courts were based on proper evaluation of evidence and did not warrant interference. ----Citations/Precedents: Saleem Akbar Kayani v. Dr. Rehana Mansha Kayani & 4 others [2016 SCR 1] Emphasizes the exclusion of Qanun-e-Shahadat and CPC provisions in Family Court proceedings to ensure expeditious resolution of family matters. Muhammad Islam vs. Mst. Rashidah Sultana and 4 others [2013 CLC 698] Highlights the customary practice of not maintaining detailed records or receipts for dowry articles. Muhammad Habib v. Mst. Safia Bibi and others [2008 SCMR 1584] Supports the validity of dowry lists without receipts, recognizing the customary nature of dowry in society. Mst. Shakeela Bibi vs. Muhammad Israr and others [2012 MLD 756] States that the sole testimony of a wife is sufficient to prove her claim for dowry articles in Family Court proceedings. Conclusion: The appeal was dismissed, and the judgments of the lower courts were upheld, confirming the decree for the recovery of dowry articles worth Rs. 89,915/- to the respondent. The appellant's objections regarding the dowry list and the alleged misreading of evidence were rejected.",
