        "Summary": "Case Summary: (a) Land Revenue Act (XVII of 1967) \u2013 Section 147, Transfer of Property Act (IV of 1882), Section 44, and Specific Relief Act (I of 1877), Sections 42 & 39 \u2013 Suit for declaration regarding a sale deed by a co-sharer within the context of private and family partition \u2013 The plaintiff argued that they were the owner in possession of the disputed land through a private partition, and the sale deed executed by the defendant exceeded the latter's fractional share. The suit was dismissed by both lower courts. Legal Validity \u2013 A co-sharer can alienate a particular portion of land, provided it does not exceed their overall share in the Khewat (a unit of joint property). A co-sharer cannot transfer land from a Khewat beyond their proportional share. In this case, the plaintiff and defendant, being brothers and co-sharers, were bound by these principles. The sale deed executed by the defendant exceeded his share and was, therefore, not legally sustainable. The courts below failed to correctly interpret the evidence, leading to a misapplication of the law. The Khewat remains a separate entity, and shares within different Khewats cannot be consolidated or transferred indiscriminately. The law dictates that no party can transfer the interest of other co-sharers, even if they are not physically in possession. Each co-sharer is considered in possession of every portion of the joint property. A private or family partition is only recognized if it is approved by a Revenue Officer, and there was no evidence in this case that such a partition had occurred. Without an official partition, no exclusive rights to a specific portion of the land can be claimed. A co-sharer, even in exclusive possession of part of the property, cannot transfer that land in a way that alters its joint nature or affects the rights of other co-owners. Therefore, the impugned sale deed and the judgments of the lower courts were set aside, and the appeal was allowed. Relevant Case Law: Mst. Nazir Begum v. Muhammad Ayyub and another, 1993 SCR 321 Syed Musarrat Shah and another v. Syed Ahmed Shah alias Lal Bacha and others, PLD 2012 Pesh.151 (b) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908) \u2013 Section 100 \u2013 The scope of second appeals allows interference with concurrent findings of lower courts if such findings result from misreading or non-reading of evidence, or if they lead to incorrect conclusions or are contrary to law. Relevant Case Law: Mst. Nazir Begum v. Muhammad Ayyub and another, 1993 SCR 321 ----- (c) Co-sharer \u2013 A co-sharer is deemed to be in possession of every portion of joint land, irrespective of physical possession. ----- (d) Co-sharer \u2013 The mere possession of a co-sharer does not extinguish the rights of other co-sharers, regardless of the duration of that possession. ---- Background: The case involves an appeal against the judgments of the District Judge and the Civil Judge, Muzaffarabad, regarding a dispute over a sale deed executed on 31.08.2010. The plaintiff/appellant filed a suit seeking a declaration, perpetual injunction, and revocation of the sale deed. The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the suit land by private partition, and alleged that the sale deed exceeded the defendant's fractional share in the land. The trial court and appellate court dismissed the plaintiff's suit, prompting this second appeal. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the sale deed dated 31.08.2010 was executed beyond the defendant's fractional share in Khewat No. 7. ---2) Whether the sale of land measuring 8 Kanals, 6 Marlas, 2 Sarsai, beyond the defendant\u2019s share, is legally sustainable. ---3) Whether concurrent findings of fact by the lower courts can be disturbed on second appeal. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the defendant/respondent exceeded his share in Khewat No. 7, as his share amounted to only 6 Kanals, 14 Marlas, 7 Sarsai. The sale deed was therefore invalid to the extent that it transferred land beyond the defendant\u2019s lawful share. The principle was reiterated that a co-sharer cannot alienate land from a particular Khewat beyond his share in that Khewat, and any such sale is inoperative with respect to the rights of the other co-sharers. The court also determined that the concurrent findings of the lower courts were based on a misreading and non-reading of evidence, particularly concerning the extent of the defendant\u2019s share. The sale deed dated 31.08.2010 was set aside to the extent of 8 Kanals, 6 Marlas, 2 Sarsai, which was executed beyond the defendant\u2019s lawful share. The appeal was allowed, and the judgments of the lower courts were set aside. ---- Citations/Precedents: Mst. Nazir Begum v. Muhammad Ayyub (1993 SCR 321) Syed Musarrat Shah and another v.

Barkat Ali v. Muhammad Ismail, 2002 SCMR 1938 ref. --- Background: This case involves an appeal against the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, which overturned two concurrent judgments from the lower courts that had dismissed a suit challenging a gift of property by the appellants\u2019 mother, Mst. Pari. The respondents, who are the appellants' sisters, filed the suit, contesting the legitimacy of the gift and the subsequent mutations in the revenue records. The suit was originally dismissed by the Civil Judge and Additional District Judge of Mardan, but the High Court decreed the suit in favor of the respondents. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the alleged gift of property by Mst. Pari to her sons was validly executed and proved. ---2) Whether the mutations made in the revenue records based on the purported gift were valid. ---3) Whether the High Court was justified in setting aside two concurrent judgments and exercising its revisional jurisdiction. ---4) Whether the burden of proof for the gift was properly discharged by the appellants. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Peshawar High Court, dismissing the appeal. The court held that the appellants had failed to prove that their mother, Mst. Pari, had gifted her property to them. Key documents, including the original statement of Mst. Pari and the mutation records, were not produced in evidence. The identification of Mst. Pari was conducted by an interested witness, Muhammad Zaman, who had personal ties to the appellants. The High Court rightly exercised its revisional jurisdiction as the lower courts had failed to appreciate that the burden of proof for the gift lay on the appellants, who did not discharge this burden adequately. Additionally, the court emphasized the need for heightened scrutiny in cases where female heirs are deprived of their inheritance through gifts. ---- Citations/Precedents: Ihtisham Ali Cheema v.

Muhammad Asim v. Mst. Samro Begum and others PLD 2018 SC 819 and Qalandri Bibi v. Mst. Irum Bibi and others 2019 YLR 86 rel. ----- Background: The petitioner and respondent No.1 were married on June 22, 2017, but their relationship deteriorated, leading to multiple legal suits. Respondent No.1 filed a suit for maintenance allowance and recovery of dowry articles worth Rs.12,48,000 on February 28, 2018. She later gave birth to respondent No.2, Ghulam Ahmad, on May 9, 2018, and filed another suit on September 1, 2018, seeking maintenance allowance for the child and delivery expenses. The trial court partially decreed both suits on September 26, 2019, granting maintenance for the iddat period, child support, and some dowry articles or their alternate price. Both parties appealed, and the appellate court modified the decision on November 28, 2019. ----- Issues: 1). Whether the dowry articles claimed by respondent No.1 were correctly assessed. --- 2). Whether the maintenance allowance for respondent No.1 and the minor (respondent No.2) was appropriate, given the petitioner's financial status. ---3). Whether the petitioner was liable to pay delivery expenses. ----4). Whether the admissibility of the dowry list was questionable due to procedural concerns. ---- Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court dismissed the petition, upholding the decisions of both the trial court and appellate court. The court found that the petitioner failed to provide evidence of his financial status, thus drawing adverse inferences against him as per precedent. It was also noted that respondent No.1 had the right to be represented by an agent, being a pardah nashin woman, and her failure to personally appear in court did not undermine her claims. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the dowry list was improperly considered and found that the appellate court rightly modified the maintenance and dowry claims. ----- Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Asim v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: M/s Staco Shahid Builders (Appellant) was awarded a contract by the Lahore Cantonment Board (Respondent) for constructing a 250-bed family wing hospital, which was later expanded to a 500-bed teaching hospital. A dispute arose over price variations, leading the appellant to file an application under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, requesting the appointment of independent arbitrators. The learned Civil Judge/Special Court for Administrative Commercial Cases, Lahore, dismissed the application, stating it was premature and referred the matter to the already appointed arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments (DML&C), Lahore Region. The appellant challenged this order in the present appeal. ----Issues: 1) Whether the arbitrator, the Director of Military Lands and Cantonments, Lahore Region, is impartial, considering his connection with the respondent. ---2) Whether the trial court erred in referring the matter to the pre-appointed arbitrator instead of appointing independent arbitrators as requested by the appellant. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Arbitration Clause: The contract between the parties, signed on August 23, 2018, included an arbitration clause naming the DML&C as the sole arbitrator. The Court found that the parties were bound by this agreement, and the appellant could not later claim impartiality issues with the appointed arbitrator. It held that known relationships between an arbitrator and one of the parties do not automatically invalidate the arbitration agreement. --- Court\u2019s Role in Arbitration: Under Section 20 of the Arbitration Act, the court\u2019s role is limited once an arbitrator is named in the contract, and it cannot substitute its choice unless the appointed arbitrator refuses to act or is incapable of acting. The appellant\u2019s claims that the DML&C is biased were deemed hypothetical and unsupported by evidence. --- Appointment of Arbitrator: The Court concluded that the appellant had willingly entered into the contract, which explicitly named the DML&C as arbitrator. Therefore, the Court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to refer the matter to the appointed arbitrator, as the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for appointing a different arbitrator. --- Legal Precedents: The Court cited precedents supporting the binding nature of arbitration agreements and the limited grounds for replacing arbitrators. It held that the appellant could approach the Court to challenge the arbitrator\u2019s conduct only after arbitration if there were any signs of misconduct or bias. --- -Outcome: The Lahore High Court dismissed the appeal, ruling that the appellant must proceed with the arbitration under the originally appointed arbitrator (DML&C) as per the contract\u2019s terms. ---- Citations/Precedents: Messrs Commodities Trading International Corporation vs. Trading Corporation of Pakistan Ltd.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Conviction upheld --- Background: This case involves Ali Hassan alias Achoo, who was convicted for the murders of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and his son Subhan, as well as the attempted murder of Muhammad Mudassar, in connection with a previous sodomy case. Ali Hassan and co-accused were charged under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), including 302(b), 324, 337A(i), 449, 109, and 34. The trial court sentenced Ali Hassan to death for the murders and acquitted the other accused. Ali Hassan appealed his conviction. ---- Issues: 1) Whether the conviction and death sentence of Ali Hassan for the murder of Mehmood-ur-Rasheed and Subhan are supported by sufficient evidence. ---2) Whether the medical evidence supports the prosecution\u2019s case. ---3) Whether the eye-witness accounts, consisting of related and interested witnesses, are reliable and credible. ---4) Whether the delay in recording the post-mortem and the statement of the injured witness raises doubts about the prosecution's case. ---5) Whether the acquittal of co-accused weakens the case against Ali Hassan. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Conviction: The Lahore High Court upheld Ali Hassan's conviction under Sections 302(b), 324, 337A(i), and 449 PPC. The Court found that the prosecution provided cogent and trustworthy evidence, including eye-witness accounts from family members and medical reports, confirming the injuries and deaths. --- Medical and Ocular Evidence: The medical evidence, although showing a minor discrepancy in the location of the injury, was consistent with the prosecution's account of the murders. The Court ruled that such minor inconsistencies do not discredit the overall prosecution narrative. --- Eyewitness Credibility: Despite being related to the victims, the Court held that the eyewitnesses\u2019 testimonies were reliable, as they were consistent and firmly withstood cross-examination. The injured witness, a child, was also deemed competent and credible. --- Post-Mortem Delay: The delay in the post-mortem and the recording of the injured witness\u2019s statement was justified due to the urgency of saving the injured child. The Court ruled that this delay did not affect the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s case. --- Acquittal of Co-Accused: The Court maintained that the acquittal of the co-accused did not undermine the case against Ali Hassan because the roles attributed to them were different and no direct evidence was presented against them for causing the deaths. --- Death Sentence: The Court confirmed the death sentence, emphasizing that the brutal nature of the crime, involving the murder of a father and his young son, justified the capital punishment. No mitigating circumstances were found to reduce the sentence. ---- Citations/Precedents: Shamsher Ahmad vs. The State (2022 SCMR 1931) Muhammad Asif vs. Mehboob Alam (2020 SCMR 837) Maskeen Ullah vs. The State (2023 SCMR 1568) Amjad Javed vs. The State (2002 SCMR 1247) Muhammad Abbas vs. The State (2023 SCMR 487) Abdur Rauf vs. The State (2003 SCMR 522) Ali Taj vs. The State (2023 SCMR 900) Muhammad Hanif vs. The State (2023 SCMR 2016) Muhammad Yaqoob vs. The State (2021 SCMR 1387)",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Bilqees Bibi, the petitioner, filed for post-arrest bail after being implicated in a murder case registered as FIR No. 1508 dated September 28, 2023, under sections 302, 148, 149, 109, and 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The case revolves around a triple murder, where the complainant alleged that the petitioner's family was angry over a love marriage between the complainant's brother and Mst. Laiba Bibi, the petitioner's relative. On September 28, 2023, the complainant and her family were invited by the petitioner\u2019s co-accused, Kaneez Bibi, to her house under the pretext of reconciling over the marriage. Once at the house, two armed co-accused, Usman and Arslan, allegedly shot and killed the complainant\u2019s relatives, Naseem Akhtar, Zaigham Abbas, and Mst. Laiba Bibi. The petitioner was accused of raising a \"lalkara\" (commanding shout) to kill the victims. ---Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner\u2019s involvement in the case, based solely on a joint \"lalkara,\" is sufficient to deny bail. ---2) Whether there is sufficient evidence against the petitioner to warrant continued detention, particularly given her lack of direct involvement in the murders. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Holding: The court granted post-arrest bail to the petitioner. ---Reasoning: No Direct Role in the Murders: The petitioner was not directly involved in the killing of the victims. The only accusation against her was that she raised a joint \"lalkara\" encouraging the co-accused to kill the complainant party. The court found that such an accusation, without more substantial evidence, was insufficient to deny bail. ----Benefit of Doubt at Bail Stage: The court applied the principle of extending the benefit of doubt at the bail stage, as outlined in Resham Khan and another vs. The State (2021 SCMR 2011), ruling that the case against the petitioner required further inquiry. ----Distinguishable Role: The petitioner was unarmed and did not directly participate in the shooting, which distinguishes her role from those who physically carried out the murders. The court noted that the allegation of merely raising a \"lalkara\" is easy to level but difficult to prove. ----Vicarious Liability: The issue of the petitioner\u2019s vicarious liability (being held responsible for the acts of others) would be determined at trial, and bail cannot be withheld as punishment when the case against her calls for further inquiry. ----Heinousness of Offense Not Grounds for Denial of Bail: The court emphasized that the mere heinousness of the crime is not sufficient to deny bail when the petitioner\u2019s entitlement to bail is otherwise established, as per Nasir Khan vs. Waseel Gul and another (PLJ 2009 SC 957) and Husnain Mustafa v. The State (2019 SCMR 1914). ----Petitioner\u2019s Age and Health: The petitioner is a 50-year-old woman with no direct involvement in the murders, and her continued detention served no further purpose as the investigation had concluded. ----Outcome: The petitioner was granted post-arrest bail, subject to furnishing bail bonds of Rs. 500,000 with two sureties. ----Citations/Precedents: Resham Khan and another vs. The State (2021 SCMR 2011) Muhammad Sarfraz Ansari vs. The State (PLD 2021 SC 738) Ali Raza vs. The State (2022 SCMR 1245) Nasir Khan vs. Waseel Gul (PLJ 2009 SC 957) Husnain Mustafa v. The State (2019 SCMR 1914) Khair Muhammad vs. The State (2021 SCMR 130) Key Takeaway: The court ruled that the petitioner's mere alleged participation through raising a \"lalkara\" without direct involvement in the crime was insufficient to deny her bail. The court emphasized that the benefit of doubt could be extended at the bail stage, and the case required further inquiry, particularly regarding her vicarious liability.",

The petitioner argued that the notices were issued in violation of the ABAD Houses Allotment Policy, 2013, and that her current posting fell under the category of deputation abroad. ---Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner, who was transferred on deputation, could retain the official residence under the ABAD Houses Allotment Policy, 2013. ----2) Whether the notices issued for the vacation of the premises were lawful and justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court allowed the petition, declaring the notices for vacation of the residence illegal and without lawful authority. The court observed: The petitioner was entitled to retain the residence under clause 14(f) of the ABAD Houses Allotment Policy, 2013, which allows employees on deputation abroad to retain official residence for a maximum of three years, provided their family resides in the residence. The respondents\u2019 reliance on clause 14(d)(iii), which limits the retention of residence to one year for officers transferred out of Punjab, was found to be inapplicable as the petitioner\u2019s current deputation fell within the scope of deputation abroad. The court emphasized that specific provisions of the policy take precedence over general provisions, and the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the more specific clause 14(f).

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (a) Appeal against acquittal--- ----Interference in judgment of acquittal by appellate court---Scope---Unless the judgment of acquittal was contrary to evidence, palpably erroneous or contained a view which could not have been taken by the court of competent jurisdiction keeping in view the settled canons of criminal jurisprudence, the court should be reluctant to interfere with such judgment of acquittal---Presumption of innocence of the accused was further strengthened by the fact of acquittal of the accused, however the court would not abjure its duty to prevent miscarriage of justice, where interference was imperative and the ends of justice so required and it was essential to appease the judicial conscience. (b) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)--- ----S. 84---Act/crime by a person of unsound mind---Defence of insanity---Maxim: actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea---Applicability---Person who is suffering from a mental disorder cannot be said to have committed a crime as he does not know what he is doing---For committing a crime, the intention and act both are taken to be the constituents of the crime: actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea---Every normal and sane human being is expected to possess some degree of reason to be responsible for his/her conduct and acts unless contrary is proved but a person of unsound mind or a person suffering from mental disorder cannot be said to possess this basic norm of human behaviour. (c) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)--- ----S. 84---Act of a person of unsound mind---Exemption from criminal liability---Scope---Insanity, proof of---Person alleged to be suffering from any mental disorder cannot be exempted from criminal liability ipso facto---Onus would be on the accused to prove by expert evidence that he is suffering from such a mental disorder or mental condition that he could not be expected to be aware of the consequences of his act---Once, a person is found to be suffering from mental disorder or mental deficiency, which takes within its ambit hallucinations, dementia, loss of memory and self-control, at all relevant times by way of appropriate documentary and oral evidence, the person concerned would be entitled to seek resort to the general exceptions from criminal liability. (d) Penal Code (XLV of 1860)--- ----Ss. 84/302/449/295---Act of a person of unsound mind, murder, house-trespass in order to commit offence punishable with death, injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class---Appeal against acquittal---Reappraisal of evidence---Murder--- Defence of insanity--\"Epileptic insanity\"---Proof and scope- --Accused suffering from continuous mental sickness---Injury inflicted by accused insufficient to cause death-- Effect---Accused was alleged to have hurled a stone on the head of the deceased which resulted in instantaneous death---Trial Court rejected plea of insanity raised by the accused and convicted him---High Court acquitted the accused on the ground that he was a person of unsound mind within the meaning of S.84 of the Penal Code, 1860 and gave directions to detain him in safe custody in a hospital or place of custody for non-criminal lunatics--- Validity--Accused led oral and documentary evidence in support of his plea of insanity---Doctor who was treating the accused had stated that the accused was suffering from \"Epilepsy\" which caused fits and behavioral abnormality- --Brother of the accused had stated that the accused was suffering from mental disorder since the year 1993 and just prior to the incident, accused suffered from epileptic attack and behaved violently and caused injuries to his own family members---Prosecution had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the injury inflicted by the accused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death---Appeal against acquittal was dismissed, in circumstances. Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology by Modi, 24th Ed. 2011 ref. ---- Background: The respondent, Shera Ram alias Vishnu Dutta, was charged with murder under Sections 302, 295, and 449 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for hurling a stone at Pujari Tulsi Das, causing his death, and damaging temple property. The trial court convicted Shera Ram, but the Rajasthan High Court later acquitted him, citing his mental unsoundness under Section 84 of the IPC. The State of Rajasthan appealed the acquittal in the Supreme Court. ----Issues: 1) Whether the respondent was entitled to the defense of insanity under Section 84 of the IPC. --2) Whether the injuries inflicted by the respondent were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. ---3) Can an appellate court interfere with the High Court\u2019s judgment of acquittal? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court upheld the acquittal, reasoning that Shera Ram was entitled to the defense of insanity under Section 84 of the IPC. The defense had established through medical and testimonial evidence that the respondent suffered from epilepsy and post-epileptic insanity, which impaired his ability to understand the nature of his actions. The Court also found that the injuries inflicted by Shera Ram were not conclusively proven to be sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The prosecution failed to establish that the injury was severe enough, based on the lack of expert testimony stating the injuries were fatal. The Supreme Court was reluctant to interfere with the High Court's acquittal, citing the principle that acquittals should not be overturned unless there is a gross misappreciation of evidence or legal principles. The High Court's decision was based on sound reasoning and evidence, and no compelling reason to reverse it was presented by the State. -----Citations/Precedents: State of Rajasthan, Through Secretary, Home Department v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, a Semi-Skilled Lineman employed by K-Electric Limited and a member of KESC Labour Union, had taken leave from June 22, 2014, to August 21, 2014. However, due to family affairs, he failed to return to work after the leave period ended. As a result, disciplinary proceedings were initiated, and his services were terminated ex parte on September 15, 2014. The petitioner served a grievance notice on September 30, 2014, but received no response. He then filed a grievance petition before the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC), which was initially decided in his favor by a single member of the NIRC. However, the Full Bench of the NIRC overturned this decision, leading the petitioner to challenge the appellate order in the High Court of Sindh, which ultimately dismissed his petition. The petitioner then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pakistan. ----Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner's termination for being absent without leave constituted misconduct under the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968. ---2) Whether the disciplinary proceedings and the subsequent punishment were conducted in accordance with the law. ---3) Whether the High Court of Sindh erred in dismissing the petitioner's appeal against his termination. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, upholding the decisions of the Full Bench of the NIRC and the High Court of Sindh. The Court reasoned that: ----Misconduct under the Ordinance: According to Standing Order 15 of the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968, unauthorized absence from duty for more than ten days constitutes misconduct. The petitioner was absent without leave for more than ten days, which was considered a valid ground for termination. ----Disciplinary Proceedings: The Court found that the disciplinary proceedings were conducted in accordance with the law. The petitioner was notified, and the inquiry concluded that the petitioner was guilty of misconduct. The Full Bench of the NIRC and the High Court of Sindh had correctly applied the law in concluding that the petitioner's termination was justified. ----Judicial Interpretation: The Court emphasized that it is not within the judiciary's purview to alter or reinterpret statutory provisions unless they violate constitutional rights. The law clearly defines ten days of unauthorized absence as misconduct, and the judiciary cannot extend or modify this period based on compassion or other considerations. -----Citations/Precedents: Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 1968 2013 SCMR 887",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case involved a family dispute over the ownership and division of joint properties among four brothers. The dispute arose when the plaintiff, one of the brothers, challenged the transfer of agricultural land by his brother (acting as his attorney) to their other brother and niece. The plaintiff claimed that the transfer was unauthorized and sought a declaration, cancellation of documents, and possession of the land. The lower courts provided mixed outcomes, with the first Appellate Court ruling in favor of the defendants (brothers), but the Revision Court overturning that decision. ----Issues: 1- Whether the family settlement and the subsequent distribution of properties were legally valid. 2- Whether the plaintiff's revocation of the power of attorney before the sale deed was effective. 3- Whether the memorandum documenting the family settlement required registration and proper attestation to be legally binding. 4- Whether the legal principle preventing an agent from transferring property to close relatives without specific permission applies in the context of a family settlement. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Family Settlement Validity: The Court held that the family settlement was genuine, fair, and intended to resolve disputes among the brothers, and thus should be upheld. The settlement aimed to promote peace and harmony within the family, and the memorandum documenting the arrangement was recognized as valid. --Revocation of Power of Attorney: The Court found that the plaintiff's claim of revoking the power of attorney before the execution of the sale deed was not credible. The sale deed was executed legally, and the revocation was not timely or properly communicated. --Memorandum and Legal Formalities: The Court concluded that the memorandum of the family settlement did not require registration or attestation, as it was not a deed of transfer but merely a record of an already agreed-upon division of properties. The memorandum was treated as a family arrangement rather than a formal legal document requiring strict legal formalities. --Application of Precautionary Principle: The Court determined that the precautionary principle (requiring specific permission for an agent to transfer property to close relatives) did not apply in this case. Family settlements are governed by principles different from those applicable to transactions between strangers, and the transfer of property in this context was consistent with the family arrangement. ----Citations/Precedents: Fida Muhammad v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The Petitioner filed an application under Section 22-A Cr.P.C. before the Ex-officio Justice of Peace, Ahmadpur East, seeking an order to compel the SHO of Police Station City Ahmadpur East to register an FIR against the Respondents. The Petitioner alleged that the Respondents, including some police officials, unlawfully entered the house of her son and detained several family members. They were later released, but the Respondents allegedly returned, abducted the family members again, and subsequently killed them during a staged police encounter. The Petitioner\u2019s attempts to file an FIR were ignored by the police, prompting the application. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Ex-officio Justice of Peace erred in dismissing the application due to the delay in filing it. 2- Whether the provisions of the Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022 apply to the alleged incident. 3- Whether the registration of FIR No. 205/2023 precludes the filing of a new complaint under the Act of 2022. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court found that the delay in filing the application should not have been the sole reason for dismissal. The Ex-officio Justice of Peace should have considered the severity of the allegations, which warranted a thorough investigation by an independent agency. The court held that the Act of 2022 applies to cases where public officials are accused of torture or custodial death. In this case, the allegations involved actions by public officials while the victims were effectively under their control, fitting within the definition of \"custody\" under the Act. The court determined that the registration of FIR No. 205/2023 does not prevent the filing of a new complaint under the Act of 2022. The Act is lex specialis and provides a new remedy that operates independently of the general criminal procedure. ----Citations/Precedents: Rafique Bibi v.

It is not correct to say that the President can invoke Article 58(2)(b) to dissolve the National Assembly only in such a grave situation in which Martial Law can be imposed as in 1977 and there is complete breakdown of Constitutional machinery. Under the said provision, the President in his discretion may dissolve the National Assembly where he forms opinion on the basis of material before him having nexus with the Dissolution Order and Article 58(2)(b), that situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and appeal to the electorate is necessary.

Provisions of Articles 148 and 149 of the Constitution regulate relationship between the Federation and a Province in a situation in which Federal law is applicable in that Province and a situation has arisen in which it is to be considered as to how the Federal law is to be made applicable so that it should bring about the desired result and be effective so that proper remedial measures are adopted to contain and control the situation in which the Federal Government has to adopt supervisory role and give directions to the Province in which the Federal law is being applied. (1) Equity--- ----Definition---\"Law\" and \"equity\"---Distinction---Equity is merged in the law in Pakistan but the principles are recognized and relief can be granted or refused on the basis of such principles., There is difference between law and equity as law is based upon set rules which may not be attracted when justice is done on the basis of equity. Equity is defined as justice administered according to fairness as contrasted with the strictly formulated rules of common law. In Pakistan equity is merged in the law but the principles are recognised and relief can be granted or not on the basis of such principles. Black's Law Dictionary ref. (m) Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Arts. 184(3) & 199---Constitutional petition---Jurisdiction of Supreme Court and High Court---Scope---Petitioner who seeks equity must come to the Court with clean hands---Conduct of the petitioner is to be taken into consideration and if he has suppressed any material fact from the Court or has come to the Court with unclean hands, then relief under the Constitutional jurisdiction can be denied to him---Making such statement by petitioner which is factually incorrect and so proved as borne out from the record, cannot be approbated. ????????? Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan is akin to and co-related with the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 where under relief is granted or not in the form of writs. One very famous maxim of equity is that petitioner who seeks equity must come to the Court with clean hands. Conduct of the petitioner is to be taken into consideration and if he has suppressed any material fact from the Court or has come to the Court with unclean hands, then relief under the Constitutional jurisdiction can be denied to him. Making such statement which is factually incorrect and so proved as borne out from the record cannot be approbated. Manzoor Hussain v. Zulfiqar Ali 1983 SCMR 137; Abdul Hafeez v.

(n)Extra judicial killing--- ---- Meaning. \"Extra judicial killing\" means a killing which has no sanction or permission under the law or which cannot be covered or defended under any provision of law. (o)Custodial killing-- ----Meaning---Burden of proof. \"Custodial killing\" means killing of a person who is* in custody of investigating agency. For that burden is upon the investigating agency to explain as to how that person, who was in their custody, met his death and whether that death was natural or unnatural and in what circumstances it had come about. Custodial killings are to be explained satisfactorily as is required under the law. (p)Extra judicial killing--- ---- Killing in encounter with police or law enforcing agencies ---Justification--Such Agency has to show that the killing had come about during exercise of right of private defence by that Agency which was in fact first attacked by the deceased and the Court has to give finding whether the killing was justified. (q)Administration of justice--- ---- Law to be allowed to take its normal course---Forums where cases are pending are to be allowed to decide them and other forums provided under the law for hearing of appeal are to be allowed to be approached as laid down and specifically provided in that law. (r)Custodial killing--- ---- If a person is taken into custody then he is bound to be dealt with strictly according to law and is to be punished only when the case is proved against him---Such person cannot be allowed to be killed by any person while he is in custody and if this is done then that clearly shows that there is no writ of law but law of jungle. (s)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Dissolution of National Assembly and dismissal of Prime Minister and the Cabinet by the President under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan---Ground---Validity---If both the Provincial Government and the Federal Government dealing with a situation where there was large scale killings and persons in custody were allegedly being killed by unknown persons in a Province and material on record beyond doubt connected the Federal Government and the Prime Minister with the handling of law and order situation then it could be said that the ground was available to the President to come to the conclusion that a situation had arisen in which the Government of the Federation could not be run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the Constitutional machinery had failed. (t)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Dissolution of National Assembly and dismissal of Prime Minister and the Cabinet by the President under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution---Such power of the President was to be exercised by him in his discretion where, in his opinion, a situation had arisen in which the Government of the Federation could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution---President, therefore, had to be objective and must have material to form his opinion in order to take the action as was contemplated under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution. (u)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Power of dissolution of National Assembly and dismissal of Prime Minister and the Cabinet by the President under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution---Nature--Availability of material in support of the grounds---Law and order situation could be one of the many grounds which could be collectively and jointly considered by the President to form opinion objectively that the situation was such that the Government of the Federation could not be carried on according to the provisions of the Constitution. While exercising power under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution, discretion of the President was not absolute but was qualified one and he had to act on the material in support of the grounds and then form opinion in objective manner. The power given to the President under Article 58(2)(b) was the power which is to be exercised by him in his discretion. No doubt the President has to form his opinion objectively which was different from subjective satisfaction and the discretion was not absolute but is qualified one, but the said provision did not say that the President had to act as a Court of law and had to form opinion on the same lines as the Courts do and give adjudication on issues of facts and laws. There is difference between the exercise of discretion by the President as provided in the Constitution and the Court of law where documents are to be produced and admitted in evidence after stringent judicial scrutiny. What was important in the context of dissolution of National Assembly by the President under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution was availability of material in support of the grounds and law and order. situation could be one of many grounds which could be collectively and jointly considered by the President to form opinion objectively that the situation was such that the Government of the Federation could not be carried on according to the provisions of the Constitution. This power was given to the President in the Constitution and not only that but it was to be used by him and this power was to be exercised by him in his discretion for which his objective assessment of the situation was required but he could not be equated with a Court of Law but only it was expected from him that he would act as per rules of prudence because he was exercising a very important power which had been conferred upon him by the Constitution and the discretion exercisable by .him was not absolute but was deemed to be qualified one and was circumscribed by the object of the law that conferred it.

(aa)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Arts. 177 & 193---Appointment of Supreme Court and High Court Judges--Procedure---Essentials---Word \"consultation\" occurring in Arts. 177 & 193 of the Constitution---Connotation. The word \"consultation\" occurring in Articles 173 and 193 of the Constitution is defined as effective, meaningful, purposive, consensusoriented, leaving no room for complaint of arbitrariness or unfair play. Recommendations made by the Chief Justice of the High Court and the Chief Justice of Pakistan in respect of appointments of Judges in the High Courts are to be accepted by the President/Executive in the absence of very sound reasons to be recorded. Acting Chief Justices are not consults within the Constitutional scheme. Ad hoc Judges can be appointed in the Supreme Court only after the sanctioned strength is exhausted. Vacancies are to be filled ordinarily within 30 days and in extraordinary circumstances within 90 days. Senior-most Judge in the High Court has legitimate expectancy to become Chief Justice and Additional Judges in the High Courts have legitimate expectancy to be made permanent Judges. Transfer of a Judge of the High Court without his consent and induction in the Federal Shariat Court is violative of Article 209. Ten years' active practice as Advocate of the High Court is mandatory for a member of Bar for appointment as a Judge in the High Court as against enrolment simpliciter. Judge of the Supreme Court may not be sent as Acting Chief Justice of the High Court. Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1996 SC 324 quoted.

Constitution is the supreme law of the land to which all laws are subordinate. Constitution is an instrument by which Government can be controlled. The provisions in the Constitution are to be construed in such a way which promotes harmony between different provisions and should not render any particular provision to be redundant as the intention is that the Constitution should be workable to ensure survival of the system which is enunciated therein for the governance of the country. Effect should be given to every part and every word of the Constitution. Hence, as a general rule, the Courts should avoid a construction which renders any provision meaningless or inoperative and must lean in favour of a construction which will render every word operative rather than one which makes some words idle and nugatory. While interpreting fundamental rights, the approach of the Court should be dynamic, progressive and liberal, keeping in view ideals of the people, socioeconomic and politico-cultural values, which in Pakistan are enshrined in the Objectives Resolution so as to extend the benefit of the same to the maximum possible. Approach of the Court while interpreting a Constitutional provision has to be dynamic, progressive and oriented with the desire to meet the situation, which has arisen, effectively. Court's efforts should be to construe the provision broadly, so that it may be able to meet the requirement of ever-changing society. General words cannot be construed in isolation but the same are to be construed in the context in which they are employed. The Constitution is a living organism and has to be interpreted to keep alive the traditions of the past blended in the happening of the present and keeping an eye on the future. Constitution is the symbol of statehood keeping united people of different races, diverse cultural, social, economic and historical traditions. It provides a method of legitimacy to the Government. It is the power behind the organs and institutions created by it. Constitution must be interpreted keeping in view the entire canvass of national fabric be it political, social, economic or religious. Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution empowers the Executive head to destroy the Legislature and to remove the chosen representatives. It is an exceptional power provided for an exceptional situation and must receive the narrowest interpretation. What is to be seen is the language used in Article 58(2)(b) which provides that the President may dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion where, in his opinion, a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. It is manifest that in the language used in this provision, there is no mention of total breakdown of Constitutional machinery or a dead-lock or stalemate. Stalemate and dead-lock mean more or less same thing, while breakdown can be on account of stalemate or dead-lock, and stalemate and deadlock can include or can occur on account of breakdown as well. Hence meaning of these words are interchangeable. The Court has to see whether there is enough material in support of the grounds for dissolution and the President was right in his opinion and has exercised his discretion justifiably and in that exercise the President is not to be equated with Court of law but it can be expected from him that he would act within the rules of prudence and fairplay. Article 58(2)(b) was inserted in the Constitution on I1-11-1985 by the Constitution (Eighth Amendment) Act, 1985. The background of this amendment was that President wanted to strike balance between the powers of the President and the Prime Minister, hence some extra powers were given to the President to be used by him in his own discretion including the above mentioned provision. Article 58(2)(b) was inserted in the Constitution on 11-11-1985 which envisages that the President may also dissolve the - National Assembly in his discretion where in his opinion a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. Article 58(2)(b) provides a remedial measure which takes care of situation in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The remedy is that the President can dismiss the Government of the Prime Minister and dissolve the National Assembly and hold election within 90 days. In such circumstances, against the dissolution of the National Assembly, appeal is heard by the people who can cast their votes and bring back the same Government and the same National Assembly or not and elect other members, who can bring about or set up new Government. All this is done within 90 days. Now the question arises as to who is going to decide whether such situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. This is to be decided by the President whose constitutional role and supervisory powers have been increased and improved by the Eighth Amendment. As President, he is consulted in Governmental affairs and the Prime Minister is supposed to apprise him of all the legislative measures which are proposed to be taken by the Government. It is the duty of the Prime Minister under Article 46 to communicate to the President all decisions of the Cabinet relating to the administration of the affairs of the Federation and proposals for legislation. In Article 58(2)(b) the words stalemate, dead-lock or complete breakdown of constitutional machinery are not mentioned and what is mentioned in very clear language is the fact that the situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The scope of Article 58(2)(b) can be understood more clearly only after one traces the historical background of this provision. In Article 58(2)(b), Constitution of Pakistan (1973) two words used are very pivotal in nature which purport to define the scope of this provision and the powers of the President in that respect. It is apparent that action can be taken under this provision by the President in his discretion for which he has to form \"opinion\" which is at lesser pedestal than \"satisfaction\". One can form opinion without touch of finality as opinion lacks the element of absolutism and can always be . differentiated from satisfaction which has a touch of finality containing the element of absolutism. In other words it can be said that opinion has lesser responsibility than satisfaction from the point of view of burden of proof. For satisfaction proof is required but for opinion some thing lesser than proof is required. For example, after seeing the clouds one may form the opinion that it may rain, but this may not come true as it was just an opinion without a touch of finality. On the other hand after seeing a wet road from a window one can say that it has rained today. Satisfaction has touch of finality for which proof has been considered. On this line of reasoning it can be said that for opinion, evidence may not be conclusive, definitive and overwhelming. The President has to form opinion on the basis of material which may include knowledge of official transactions with which he has some nexus and the Court must not substitute its own opinion with the opinion of the President, nor can the Court sit in appeal on the opinion of the President. In such circumstances opinion of the Court differs from the opinion of the President because in forming the opinion the Court has to examine the evidence and some times has to record the evidence including examination-in-chief, cross-examination and reexamination as happens in the proceedings before the Court of law for which proper procedure is prescribed. 'Satisfaction' is by no means a term of art and appears to have been used in its ordinary dictionary sense. 'Satisfaction' is the existence of a state of mental persuasion much higher than a mere opinion and when used in the context of judicial proceedings, has to be arrived at in compliance with the prescribed statutory provision and other legal requirements. Far from being a subjectively or capriciously arrived at conclusion, it presumes observance of certain well-settled judicial principles and is a firm state of mind admitting of no doubt or indecision or oscillation. To be 'satisfied' with a state of things is to be honestly convinced in one's own mind. Apart from the 'legal satisfaction', which is a term of art and connotes discharge of a claim, debt or legal demand, to satisfy in the ordinary sense is to convince. Satisfactory evidence is sufficient evidence meaning an amount of proof which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced mind beyond a reasonable doubt. 'Satisfy' is synonymous with, 'convince beyond a reasonable doubt' and 'satisfaction' is a state of mind, which connotes a sense of certainty, and conviction or release from suspense, doubt or uncertainty. 'To satisfy' means to furnish with sufficient proof or information or to assure or set free from doubt or uncertainty to convince. It is in the light of the legal position stated above that one has to consider as to how the President is supposed to form his opinion for taking action contemplated under Article 58(2)(b) which stands at lesser pedestal than satisfaction. Whereas the opinion of the President is not legal opinion formed by the Court, hence the President cannot be equated with the Court of law so far the degree of proof is concerned in forming his opinion. It is in this context that the material available before the President for forming such opinion is to be considered whether it was sufficient or not to help him to form such opinion. The President can dismiss the Government and dissolve the National Assembly in his discretion only when there is complete breakdown of constitutional machinery. Action of the President under Article 58(2)(b) was open to question by the Court and was not beyond their jurisdiction. The Court could question the action of the President in dissolving the National Assembly to find out whether it was based on facts or not. \"Discretion\" and formation of \"opinion\" had to be based on facts and reasons which are objective realities. The discretion can be exercised by the President when machinery of the Government has broken down completely and its authority eroded and the Government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Discretion conferred by Article 58(2)(b) on the President cannot, therefore, be regarded as absolute one but is to be deemed as qualified one in the sense that it is circumscribed by the object of law that confers it. The discretion of the President is not absolute but is to be deemed as qualified one and is circumscribed by the object of law that confers it. The Court can go into the question whether the discretion is exercised justifiably or not and whether there is material in support of the grounds. 4n other words discretion is put in strait-jacket and is made open to judicial review. Emphasis is on the fact that exercise of discretion to dissolve the National Assembly is closely co-related with appeal to the electorate which is to be done within 90 days as provided under Article 48(5) of the Constitution. Discretion of the President is not absolute but is deemed to be qualified one and is circumscribed by the object of law that has conferred it. 'Further, opinion can be formed objectively on the basis of material which must have nexus with the grounds of the order of dissolution. Article 58(2)(b) though added by the Eighth Amendment is integral part of the Constitution and could be removed or repealed by the Parliament according to the procedure prescribed in the Constitution. Apart from that, in each case of dissolution of the Assembly by the President and dismissal of the Government of the Prime Minister, the discretion is not absolute but is qualified and the President has to be objective in assessment of the situation and everything depends upon the material which is produced in support of the grounds. The expression 'cannot be carried on' sandwiched as it is between 'Federal Government' and ' in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution', acquires a very potent, a very positive and a very concrete content. Nothing has been left to surmises, likes or dislikes, opinion or view. It does not concern itself with the pace of the progress, the shade of the, quality or the degree of the performance or the quantum of the achievement. It concerns itself with the breakdown of the Constitutional mechanism, a stalemate, a deadlock in ensuring the observance of the provisions of the Constitution. The historical perspective in which such a provision found a place in the Constitution reinforces this interpretation. It is an extreme power to be exercised where there is an actual or imminent breakdown of the constitutional machinery as distinguished from a failure to observe a particular provision of the Constitution. There may be occasion for the exercise of this power where there takes place extensive, continued and pervasive failure to observe not one but numerous provisions of the Constitution creating the impression that the country is governed not so much by the Constitution but by the methods extra-constitutional. The expression 'the Government of Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution' in Article 58(2)(b) contemplates a situation where the affairs of the Government are not capable of being run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution either on account of persistent, deliberate and continued violation of various provisions of the Constitution by the Government in power, or on account of some defect in the structure of the Government, its functioning in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution is rendered impossible. The use of expression 'cannot be carried on' necessarily imports an element of impossibility and disability and refers to a irretrievable and irreversible situation. An unintentional and bona fide omission to follow a particular provision of the Constitution, not resulting in the breakdown of Government machinery or creating a situation of a stalemate or deadlock in the working of the Government, will not be covered in the situations contemplated under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution. Even otherwise this is a remedial provision in the Constitution which prevents the country from plunging into the disaster as was witnessed in 1977 and if the President is of the opinion that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, then this provision can be invoked because this is a much better provision to prevent Martial Law. After the dismissal of the Government, remedy of elections is available, and such elections can be held within 90 days in which the people have to return their verdict on the question of dissolution of the Assembly and dismissal of the Government. The order of dissolution is also subject to judicial review of the Court. Now if the language used in Article 58(2)(b) is to be construed liberally not in favour of the President but against him who is supposed to exercise his discretion as allowed by the Constitution, even then in every situation in which it is not possible for the Government of the Federation to be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, there will be a stalemate, dead-lock and breakdown of the constitutional mechanism which may be not on the same lines and not on the same scale and not with same gravity and not of the same magnitude as in 1977 which warranted imposition of Martial Law. For example the Supreme Court has rendered a judgment giving interpretation of Articles of the Constitution relating to appointment of Judges in the superior Courts and it is held that the President has to act on the advice of the Prime Minister in respect of appointments of Judges in the superior Courts subject to the judgment of the Supreme Court and if the Prime Minister refuses to comply with the judgment, then the situation can be called a dead-lock because the Prime Minister, by not complying with the judgment, also violates Article 190 of the Constitution which envisages that all executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan shall act in aid of the Supreme Court. The Prime Minister also violates his/her oath of office which is to the effect that \"I will discharge my duties and perform my functions, honestly, to the best of my ability, faithfully, in accordance with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the law ??That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan\". If the Prime Minister ridicules the Judiciary, then there is violation of Article 63(1)(g) which does not allow propagating any opinion affecting the integrity or independence of the Judiciary of Pakistan which amounts to bringing into ridicule the Judiciary or the Armed Forces of Pakistan. If such thing is done by any member of the Parliament, then such member could be disqualified from being elected as member of the Parliament as is contemplated under Article 63(1) of the Constitution. Other examples are telephone tapping, extra judicial killings and so on, which can give rise to the impression that the country is governed not so much by the Constitution but the methods extra-constitutional. In every case what is to be seen is the material in support of the grounds mentioned in the order of dissolution. Federation of Pakistan v. Muhammad Saifullah Khan PLD 1989 SC 16.6; Kh.

Al-Jehad Trust v. Federation of Pakistan PLD 1997 SC 84 ref. (pp)Interpretation of Constitution-- ----Construction of provisions of Constitution---Principles. The Constitution is a living organism and has to be interpreted to keep alive the traditions of the past blended in the happening of the present and keeping an eye on the future. Constitution is the symbol of statehood keeping united people of different races, diverse cultural, social, economic and historical traditions. It provides a method of legitimacy to the Government. It is the power behind the organs and institutions created by it. Constitution must be interpreted keeping in view the entire canvass of national fabric be it political, social, economic or religious. Constitution is the supreme law of the land to which all laws are subordinate. Constitution is an instrument by which Government can be controlled. The provisions in the Constitution are to be construed in such a way which promotes harmony between different provisions and should not render any particular provision to be redundant as the intention is that the Constitution should be workable to ensure survival of the system which is enunciated therein for the governance of the country. Effect should be given to every part and every word of the Constitution. Hence, as a general rule, the Courts should avoid a construction which renders any provision meaningless or inoperative and must lean in favour of a construction which will render every word operative rather than one which may make some words idle and nugatory. While interpreting fundamental rights, the approach of the Court should be dynamic, progressive and liberal keeping in view ideals of the people, socioeconomic and politico-cultural values which in Pakistan are enshrined in the Objectives Resolution so as to extend the benefit of the same to the maximum possible. Approach of the Court while interpreting a Constitutional provision has to be dynamic, progressive and oriented with the desire to meet the situation, which has arisen, effectively. Court's efforts should be to construe the provision broadly, so that it may be able to meet the requirement of ever changing society. General words cannot be construed in isolation but the same are to be construed in the context in which they are employed. Special Reference No. l of 1957 PLD 1957 SC 219; State v.

J. aereeing-- (uu)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Scope and application of Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution--Every breach or stray violation may not attract Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution, but whether the breach and its effect had nexus with Art.58(2)(b), depended upon the nature of breach and the circumstances in which it had been caused. Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan no doubt empowers the President to take action, but only where it is shown that 'a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution'. The President does not possess unfettered or unlimited power under Article 58(2)(b). It is restricted and circumscribed by preconditions. First he has to form opinion objectively on the material before him having nexus with the preconditions laid down by Article 58(2)(b) sufficient to satisfy any prudent man of normal intelligence that the Government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and appeal to electorate is necessary. Thereafter, the President may exercise discretion to dissolve the Assembly. The situation which arises and leads to formation of opinion that the Government cannot be carried on in accordance with the Constitution may not be restricted to any one solitary instance of war-like conditions. There may be various and many situations. It is not possible to give an exhaustive list. Human nature, conduct, tactics, strategy, mechanism and political manoeuvring always change, fluctuate and create unpredictable situations to which Article 58(2)(b) may be applied. Article 58(2)(b) requires the President first to form his opinion that the Government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. This Article does not provide whether the basis for forming such opinion should be evidence as required in a Court of Law or material having nexus with the reasons mentioned in the Dissolution Order, sufficient to form an opinion. There should be sufficient material available to the President before forming the opinion. Proved evidence according to the Qanun-e-Shahadat or repealed Evidence Act to be the basis for forming opinion by the President is not required by the Court. It, therefore, does not require the standard of proof of evidence as required during a trial in a Court of Law. There should be material having nexus with Article 58(2)(b) sufficient to satisfy the President before forming the opinion. This does not mean that the material relied upon be vague, irrelevant, false, forged, concocted or which did not exist at the time of forming opinion. The material should be trustworUiy prima facie authentic relating to the incidents, events and happenings relied or referred on the basis of which a person of ordinary prudence, intellect and knowledge is able to form the same opinion. Apart from the fact that Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan can be used where there is a complete dead-lock and stalemate in observance of the provisions of the Constitution it can be invoked in circumstances where there exists constant, repeated and continued failure to observe the provisions of the Constitution to the extent that it creates an impression on a prudent man of ordinary intelligence that the Government of the Federation is not carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, but by extra-constitutional methods and devices. A dead-lock can be caused due to non-observance or breach of the Constitution in such a manner* that the Government seems to be carried on in violation of the. provisions of the Constitution. However, every breach or stray violation may not attract Article 58(2)(b), but whether the breach and its effect have nexus with the said Article, depends upon the nature of breach and the circumstances in which it has been caused. Stalemate or breakdown is the result of incidents, occurrences, causes, happenings, conduct and several other factors which may lead to it. Such causes and instances may be many and several but the limitation is that it may result in stalemate, breakdown and serious violations of the provisions of the Constitution adversely affecting the functioning of the Government according to the Constitution. The first consideration, therefore, will be whether situation has arisen in which Government cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and law. Where a Government cannot be run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution then it indicates the failure of the constitutional machinery. Such situation arises when the writ of the Government is not enforceable, a climate of uncertainty and diffidence has been created on different levels of administration, there is general flouting and disrespect to the organs and Departments of the State; the institutions, organs and authorities constituted under the Constitution and the law, flout of law, external aggression bringing the entire machinery of the Government at a standstill; internal disturbances, insurgency, revolt, rebellion or civil war and economic crises which may paralyse the life and administration. Another situation may cover it when the Legislature no longer reflects the wishes or views of the electorate and they are at variance. There is large scale civil disobedience movement in which Government servants and employees of corporations, companies, banks and authorities connected with the day to day administration of the State refuse to cooperate and subjects refuse to pay taxes. The majority ruling power refutes, violates or refuses to run the Government according to Constitution and law. The writ of Government is no longer respected and is not enforceable. These are some situations during which machinery of the Government cannot be run in accordance with the Constitution. No exhaustive list can be provided but it entirely depends on the circumstances, facts and events which may happen. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif v.

(ww) Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Arts. 9, 14 & 25---Right to life---Inviolability of dignity of man---Equality before law---\"Life\"---Meanings---Extra judicial killings or custodial deaths, arrests and torture---Such acts by the State machinery violate Fundamental Rights under which a person is entitled to be treated according to law and equally before law---Human dignity being inviolable, the right to life could not be taken away except as provided by law, for there was no law to justify such an act perpetrated by the State machinery. The Constitution guarantees Fundamental Rights, which are inviolable. Under Article 9 every person in Pakistan is guaranteed a \"right to life\" and he cannot be deprived of life and liberty except in accordance with law. Thus, it is a sacred right, which cannot be violated, discriminated or abused by any authority. The word 'life' is very significant as it covers all facets of human existence. The word 'life' has not been defined in the Constitution but it does not mean nor can it be restricted only to the vegetative or animal life or mere existence from conception to death. Life includes all such amenities and facilities which a person born in a free country is entitled to enjoy with dignity, legally and constitutionally. The Constitutional Law in America provides an extensive and wide meaning to the word 'life' which includes all such rights which are necessary and essential for leading a free, proper, comfortable and clean life. The requirement of acquiring knowledge, to establish home, the freedoms as contemplated by the Constitution, the personal rights and their enjoyment are nothing but part of life. A person is entitled to enjoy his personal rights and to be protected from encroachments on such personal rights, freedom and liberties. Any action taken which may create hazards of life will be encroaching upon the personal rights of a citizen to enjoy the life according to law. Article 9 of the Constitution which guarantees life and liberty according to law is not to be construed in a restricted and pendantic manner. Life has a larger concept which includes the right of enjoyment of life, maintaining adequate level of living for full enjoyment of freedom and rights. Extra judicial killings or custodial deaths cannot be justified as valid, legal or proper. Explanation had been given by the Authorities that such persons were hardened criminals and were killed during encounters. Even hardened criminals have a right to be prosecuted and charges to be proved against them according to law. Who is to decide that a particular person under arrest is a terrorist or a hardened criminal. This is not the authority of the Executive or any Agency to decide it beforehand and start operation to kill him. It is the domain of the Court to decide the offence committed by 'a particular person and according to the law we are governed, a person alleged to have committed any crime shall be treated as innocent till the Court announces its verdict holding him guilty. This principle has been provided to safeguard the interest of the accused and also to protect the citizens from the highhandedness of the investigating/police authorities. When the agencies charged with the duty to protect the life and property of the citizens indulge in extra-judicial killings, then starts State terrorism in which the Police Authorities, the Rangers or any other agency is permitted by an executive order to execute, eliminate or kill a particular person. The crime becomes more heinous where persons are arrested under any charge, false or true, and then they are killed while in custody of the Police/Rangers. This law of jungle cannot be allowed to be perpetuated nor any civilized Government can be allowed to continue with it without any check. Such acts violate Article 9 of the Constitution which confers, protects and preserves life, liberty and property of the citizens. The Law of Nations does not allow to kill even an enemy soldier except in battle. So it is only in war that the persons who are fighting facing each other can be killed, but it does not permit the killing wholesale or en masse or even an individual if he is not in the battlefield. Even the prisoners of war are not allowed to be killed. Such acts by the State machinery violate Fundamental Rights under which a person is entitled to be treated according to law and equally before law. The human dignity is inviolable and that the right to life cannot be taken away except as provided by law. There is no law to justify such an act perpetrated by the State machinery. The object of guaranteeing Fundamental Rights and providing for their enforcement under Article 184(3) is intended to promote social, economic and cultural conditions, which promote life, liberty and dignity. The right to life, therefore, not only guarantees genuine freedom, but freedom from wants, illiteracy, ignorance, poverty and above all freedom from arbitrary restraint from authority. The right to life includes the right of personal security and safety, the right to have clean and lawful administration, the right to have honest and incorruptible actions by the authorities. All Government Authorities, civil, military or paramilitary are bound by the Constitution to enforce, respect and protect such rights and do not have the authority, power or right to destroy it, trample it or make a mockery of such right. All persons who are found responsible for such actions and violations must suffer prosecution and should be brought to book according to law. The right to life includes the right to live with respect, honour and dignity. Even a person, who violates any law, has the right to be treated and dealt with according to law. If a person is denied the right to life, then all rights which emanate from being a living human being, also vanish. In a State where extra-judicial killings are made at the orders of the Government at the helm of affairs, it cannot be treated as constitutional, legal or civilized. Such extra-judicial killings, seizure and search not only violate the right to life, but impinge on the dignity of man and privacy of home as conferred by Article 14 of the Constitution. Such actions also violate Article 25 as the victims being citizens of Pakistan cannot be discriminated and have to be treated according to law and given equal protection of law. Shehla Zia v.

(yy)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 63---Ridiculing the Judiciary or judgment of Court -Effect To ridicule the Judiciary in any manner exhibits the greatest disrespect to an Institution which is a pillar in the State management and is a constitutional organ with powers conferred on it particularly to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. It also interprets the Constitution and the law and can declare a law void and actions taken by the Executive and in certain cases by the Legislature to be without jurisdiction and of no legal effect. All the institutions of the State, be it Legislature, Executive or the Judiciary, deserve full respect and cannot be ridiculed publicly or privately. A judgment cannot be publicly ridiculed nor can anybody under the garb of fair comment criticise a judgment to degrade the Judiciary and the Judges in the eye of public. Any person ridiculing the judgment, or Judiciary making disparaging remarks about the Judges and their conduct in Court could be hauled up for contempt of Court. However, the elected representatives of the Houses have more burden to share because under the Constitution Article 63 clearly provides that any person, if he propagates any opinion or acts in any manner prejudicial to the integrity or independence of the Judiciary of Pakistan, shall be disqualified from being elected, chosen as and from being a member of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament). Any person who has ridiculed the Judiciary would be disqualified even from seeking election to any of the Houses or being a member of a House.

(ddd)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Arts. 14, 9 & 19---Interpretation and scope of Arts. 9 & 14 of the Constitution---Inviolability of dignity of man and security of a person--Concept---Telephone tapping and eavesdroppings mar the protection afforded and guaranteed to the right to life and infringe the secrecy and privacy of a man---\"Privacy of home\"---Connotation---Telephone tapping and eavesdroppings being unconstitutional, appropriate mode of its regulation was desired by the Supreme Court---Supreme Court, however, observed that so long proper law was not legislated in the field which may protect the violation of Constitutional rights, in future whenever any telephone is required to be tapped, intruded or eavesdropping exercise is to be carried on, it should be done with the prior permission of the Supreme Court or by a Commission constituted by the Supreme Court which shall examine each case on its marits---Permission if granted by the Supreme Court or the Commission as the case may be, shall not exceed a period of six weeks and shall be reviewed immediately on expiry of six weeks. Article 14 of the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees to protect dignity of man and the privacy of home which shall be inviolable subject to law. This provision providing for the dignity of man as a Fundamental Right, is unparalleled in the Constitutions and hardly Constitutions of a few countries provide for it. Dignity of man is not only provided by Constitution of Pakistan, but according to history and belief under Islam great value has been attached to the dignity of man and the privacy of home. If a person intrudes into the privacy of any man, pries into the private life, it injures the dignity of man, it violates the privacy of home, it disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the family and above all it puts such person to serious danger of being blackmailed. Such acts are not permissible under law and if any occasion arises for such operation, then it can be only in cases of defence and national security. Article 9 of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law. Here the Constitution guarantees against any attack on life or liberty of a person subject to law. The word 'life' is not restricted to animal life or vegetative life. It carries with it the right to live in a clean atmosphere, a right to live where all Fundamental Rights are guaranteed, a right to have rule of law, a right to have clean and incorruptible administration to govern the country and the right to have protection from encroachment on privacy and liberty. With this definition of the word 'life' one would not deter to state that telephone-tapping and eavesdropping mar the protection afforded and guaranteed to the right to life. It infringes the secrecy and privacy of a man which may ultimately be a source of danger and insecurity. In this way the liberty guaranteed to a person is also invaded, restricted and circumvented. Therefore, if this exercise is to be considered from any angle, be it constitutional, legal or moral, no justification can be afforded for such reprehensible acts by the officials or the persons at the helm of governance of the country. History is replete with incidents when on breach of such rights Governments have been toppled. Not too far is the incident of Watergate when the President of America for conducting and interfering with the telephones and communication system of the Opposition had to resign and he was thrown out of office. It is unlawful to intercept, reveal the existence of and disclose or divulge the contents of, wire or oral communications, unless the interceptor has previously obtained an order of a Court permitting a wiretap or other interception of the communication, or one party has consented to the interception. Constitution in clear terms guarantees that the dignity of man and subject to law, the privacy of home, shall be inviolable and further that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law. One may on strict interpretation of the words \"the privacy of home\" say that such guarantee is restricted to privacy of home and not office or any other premises outside home. This would be a restricted, illogical and completely out of context interpretation. The Constitution is to be interpreted in a liberal and beneficial manner which may engulf and incorporate the spirit behind the Constitution and also the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The dignity of man and privacy of home is inviolable, it does not mean that except in home, his privacy is vulnerable and can be interfered or violated. Home in literal sense will mean a place of abode--a place where a person enjoys personal freedom and feels secure. The emphasis is not on the boundaries of home but the person who enjoys the right wherever he may be. The term 'home' connotes meaning of privacy, security and non-interference by outsiders which a person enjoys. According to Ballentine's Law Dictionary, \"in ancient law French, the word (home) also signified a man\". It also defines as \"sometimes including not only a place of abode, but also support and maintenance\". Wider meaning should be given to the word 'home'. The term 'privacy of home' also symbolises the security and privacy of a nature which a person enjoys in his home. The term \"privacy of home\" cannot be restricted to the privacy in respect of home, the privacy within the four walls of the home. It refers to .the privacy, which is sacred and secure like the privacy a person enjoys in his home. Such privacy of home a person is entitled to enjoy wherever he lives or works, inside the premises or in open land. Even the privacy of a person cannot be intruded in public places. The inviolability of privacy is directly linked with the dignity of man. If a man is to preserve his dignity, if he is to live with honour and reputation, his privacy, whether in home or outside the home has to be saved from invasion and protected from illegal intrusion. The right conferred under Article 14 is not to any premises, home or office, but to the person, the man/woman wherever he/she may be. An unauthorized intrusion into a person's home and the disturbance caused to him thereby, is, as it were, the violation of a common law right of a man - an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if not of the very concept of civilization. Another aspect of the case in terms of the constitutional provision cannot be ignored that once any person's telephone is subjected to eavesdropping,, tapping, intrusion or interference of any kind, it interferes with the right of free speech and expression. Normally a person talking on telephone always presumes that his voice is heard only by the person at the other end of the telephone. The telephonic system itself presumes that except the speaker and the listener no one else can hear the talks from one end to the other. This ensures privacy and freedom of speech as a person in the presence of others may not be able to talk so freely or to express himself without any restriction or hesitation. Therefore, the tapping and eavesdropping of telephone also infringes Article 19 which guarantees that every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the interest of glory of Islam or the integrity, security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign States, public order, decency or morality or in, relation to contempt of Court, commission of or incitement to an offense. No procedure has been laid down for regulating the tapping, taping or eavesdropping of private or official telephones. Mere S.R.Os., official directions, rules or orders of the President, Prime Minister, Ministers, or other members of the Executive cannot permit or validate violation of the constitutional provisions. So long proper law is not legislated in this field which may protect the violation of constitutional rights, Supreme Court directed that in future whenever any telephone is required to be tapped, taped, intruded or eavesdropping exercise is to be carried on, it should be done with the prior permission of the Supreme Court or by a Commission constituted by the Supreme Court which shall examine each case on its merits. The permission if granted by the Supreme Court, or the Commission as the case tray be, shall not exceed a period of six weeks and shall be reviewed immediately on expiry of six weeks. Tapping of telephones and eavesdropping of any person is reprehensible, immoral, illegal and unconstitutional act which the Authorities, finding that there is no clear provision to stop it, have indulged in such illegal activities. Constitution in clear terms gives guarantee against such violation. Therefore, such acts are unconstitutional and appropriate mode for its regulation should be legislated. Till such time it is duly regulated by any legislative act, Supreme Court would be justified to issue such direction to protect violation of Fundamental Rights. Kh. Ahmed Tariq Rahim v.

(iii)Words and phrases-- ??????????? ......????? Home\" and \"privacy of home\" ---Meaning elaborated. Ballentine's Law Dictionary ref. Per Irshad Hassan Khan, J.; Raia Afrasiab Khan and Munawar Ahmad Mirza, JJ. a2reeina- (jjj)Constitution of Pakistan (1973)--- ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Dissolution of National Assembly and dismissal of Prime Minister and the Cabinet by the President under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution---Grounds---Material including newspaper clippings etc. relied upon by the President in dissolving the National Assembly was, of course, relevant and could be taken into consideration as admissible material on the basis of which a person of ordinary prudence would conclude that the matters and events narrated therein did occur but not a strict proof of the matters stated therein as is adjudicated in a regular trial. (kkk)Constitution of Pakistan (1973) ----Art. 58(2)(b) [before its omission by Constitution (Thirteenth Amendment) Act (I of 1997)]---Interpretation, scope and application of Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution---Dissolution of National Assembly and dismissal of Prime Minister and the Cabinet by the President under Art.58(2)(b) of the Constitution---For exercising such powers by the President the requirement was not \"satisfaction\" of the President that situation had arisen in which the Government of Federation could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate was necessary but that of formation of \"opinion\" to the same effect---\" Opinion\" and \"satisfaction\" ---Connotation and distinction---Standard of proof in the form of material---Court was merely required to examine as to whether or not the President had exercised his power in accordance with the provisions of Art.58(2)(b) and that the action taken by him was bona fide and in doing so Court was not required to hold an enquiry with the charges levelled in the dissolution order, as if it was a Criminal Court. For exercising power by the President under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution the requirement is not 'satisfaction' of the President that situation has arisen in which the Government of Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary but that of formation of 'opinion' to the same effect. The Framers of the Constitution deliberately chose a lesser word of 'opinion' instead of 'satisfaction'. For example, under sub-clause (b) of clause (1) of Article 199 of the Constitution, on the application of any person the High Court may issue an appropriate writ, if it is 'satisfied' that no other adequate remedy is provided by law. Similarly, under Articles 232 and 233 of the Constitution relating to proclamation of emergency on account of war, internal disturbances etc. and power to suspend fundamental rights etc. during emergency period, there is concept of Presidential satisfaction and not that of formation of opinion. where the President is so satisfied he can assume power of Provincial Government. Whereas under Article 58(2)(b), the requirement is not 'satisfaction' but formation of 'opinion' by the President. There is, thus, clear distinction as to the connotation of these two words. For formation of 'opinion' lesser burden of proof is required than that of 'satisfaction'. It is not to be based on overwhelming and conclusive evidence but on some material on the basis of which a reasonable man can form an opinion that the Government of the Federation cannot be run in accordance with the Constitution. The standard of proof in the form of material to support the charges cannot be the same as required for the proof of a criminal charge. On the other hand, 'satisfaction' is the existence of a state of mental persuasion much higher than a mere 'opinion' and when used in the context of judicial proceedings has to be arrived at in compliance with the prescribed statutory provisions. The President can, therefore, exercise his power under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution if there is some material before him showing that the affairs of the Government of the Federation cannot be run in accordance with the Constitution. The words 'stalemate' or 'deadlock' do not appear in the provisions of Article 58(2)(b). These concepts are to be read in the said Article in view of the process of judicial pronouncements. Clearly, for formation of an opinion, the President can take note o! what the world says about State terrorism or other affairs of the Government. Of course, for forming opinion on the basis of such information he has to apply his independent mind. Contemporaneous acts can also be looked into by the President. He can also take judicial notice of press reports. Press reports etc. can be relied upon, not as a strict proof of the matters stated therein as required by the law of evidence during a trial in a Court of law, but as a part of the material on the basis of which a person of ordinary prudence would conclude that the matters and the events narrated therein, did occur. Court has, however, no concern with the quantity or sufficiency of the material nor can it sit in appeal on dissolution order passed by the President provided that the grounds stated therein have nexus with Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution. The Court is merely required to examine as to whether or not the President has exercised his power in accordance with the provisions of Article 58(2)(b) and that the action taken by him is bona fide and in doing so the Court is not required to hold an enquiry into the charges levelled in the Dissolution Order, as if it was a criminal Court. It is difficult to enumerate exhaustively the circumstances which may indicate the failure of the Constitutional machinery within the ambit of Article 58(2)(b). It. depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The principles laid down in Muhammad Nawaz Sharif's case still hold the field. These principles do not envisage dissolution of the National Assembly on ground of complete breakdown of the Constitutional machinery alone. It is not correct to say that Article 58(2)(b) can be invoked only when there is a state of war in the country, life has completely paralysed and the conditions are such as were prevalent in 1977 which had brought the country to the brink of disaster necessitating Martial Law. Clearly, the President in his discretion may dissolve the National Assembly where he forms an opinion on the basis of material before him having direct nexus with the conditions laid down in Article 58(2)(b), that a situation has arisen in which the Government of the Federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary. Once the evil is identified, remedial and corrective measures within the constitutional framework must follow. There is also no force in the contention that the President should have resorted to alternate constitutional remedies before taking a drastic step of dissolving the National Assembly. No alternate remedy was available to the President but the alternate constitutional remedies are only available to the Prime Minister on whose advice the President has to act. The President has to form the opinion objectively on the basis of the material having nexus with the grounds mentioned in the order which in turn, has to have nexus with the grounds laid down in Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution, manifesting conscious and bona fide application of his mind. A Court could not sit as a Court of Appeal while examining the order of dissolution of the Assembly under the Constitution nor it could substitute or go into the question of sufficiency or otherwise of the material relied upon by the President, provided the material forming the basis of his opinion had nexus with the grounds of dissolution order as well as Article 58(2)(b). Newspaper clippings etc. could be relied upon as material in support of the grounds of dissolution. The President could also produce corroborative or confirmative material in support of the grounds which had been made available after the order of dissolution. Newspaper cuttings can be relied upon as material in support of the dissolution of the National Assembly. However, Court has no concern with the quantity or sufficiency of the material nor can it sit in appeal on Dissolution Order passed by the President, provided the material relied upon has nexus with the grounds mentioned in the impugned order which in turn has nexus with Article 58(2)(b) manifesting application of mind by the President.

The Family Courts Act, 1964, Section 14, provides a limited right of appeal to the District Court, with no further right of appeal to the High Court. The Supreme Court reiterated that under Article 199 of the Constitution, the High Court cannot sit as a court of appeal to address factual controversies in family law matters. The findings of the Trial Court and the Appellate Court were based on proper evaluation of evidence and were upheld by the High Court. The Supreme Court found no misreading or non-reading of evidence. The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, finding it devoid of merit, and upheld the High Court's well-reasoned order. ---Citations/Precedents: Ibrahim v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail granted ---- Background: The petitioner, Zeeshan S/o Gul Hussain, sought post-arrest bail under Sections 302, 324, 427, and 34 PPC. The FIR was lodged by Qaiser Jamal on 20 August 2023 concerning a violent altercation that resulted in the death of Shahid Jamal and injuries to Haider Jamal. The dispute arose over property construction halted by Aukaf employees and police. Following their departure, the petitioner, along with co-accused, allegedly broke into the property and fired upon the complainant and his family, resulting in the aforementioned casualties. ----Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner\u2019s absconding for seven months should affect his eligibility for post-arrest bail. ---2) Whether the lack of medical evidence for Haider Jamal\u2019s injuries and the non-recovery of the firearm impact the bail decision. ---3) Whether the principle of consistency, given the grant of bail to a co-accused, applies to the petitioner\u2019s case. ---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Absconding: The Court noted the petitioner\u2019s seven-month absconding period but concluded it should not solely determine the refusal of bail. Lack of Medical Evidence: The absence of an injury statement or medical report for Haider Jamal and the failure to recover the firearm were significant factors in assessing the case\u2019s merit. These gaps contributed to the Court's determination that the case required further inquiry. Principle of Consistency: Co-accused Syed Shahab Ali Shah had already been granted post-arrest bail by the Court on 4 December 2023. Applying the rule of consistency, the Court found the petitioner similarly entitled to post-arrest bail. ---Citations/Precedents: Sections 302, 324, 427, 34 PPC: Pertaining to murder, attempt to murder, mischief causing damage, and common intention, respectively. Rule of Consistency: Legal principle ensuring similar treatment in bail decisions among co-accused in the same case. ---Conclusion: The Supreme Court of Pakistan granted post-arrest bail to the petitioner, Zeeshan S/o Gul Hussain, considering the need for further inquiry into the case and applying the rule of consistency. The bail was set at Rs. 200,000/- with a PR bond of the same amount, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The observations made were tentative and should not influence the trial's merits.

The FIR was lodged following an incident on 11 October 2023, where a family altercation over a joint guest room escalated into a violent confrontation, resulting in injuries and fatalities. ----Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner is entitled to post-arrest bail given the severity of the charges and the evidence presented. ---2) Whether the counter version of the incident filed by the petitioner can influence the decision on bail. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Post-Arrest Bail: The Supreme Court denied the petitioner\u2019s request for post-arrest bail. The decision was based on the following points: Positive Firearm Expert Report: The report confirmed that the fifteen 7.62 bore crime empties recovered from the scene were fired from the Kalashnikov linked to the petitioner. ----Witness Statements: Testimonies from the occurrence indicated the petitioner's involvement in the commission of the offenses. Incriminating Material: Sufficient evidence was found against the petitioner, including the recovery of the crime weapon. ----Nature of Offenses: The petitioner is accused of heinous, non-bailable offenses, including the murder of two individuals and assault on the complainant and his family. Counter Version: The petitioner\u2019s counter version of the events, registered on the same day, claimed that the complainant's party attacked him and his wife during construction work, leading to injuries and property damage. However, the Court found this insufficient to grant bail, given the strong incriminating evidence against the petitioner. ----Citations/Precedents: Section 302 PPC: Punishment for murder. Section 324 PPC: Attempt to commit murder. Section 337-F(v), A(i), 337-D, 34 PPC: Pertaining to causing hurt and shared intention. Section 15-AA: Relating to firearms and ammunition offenses. ---Conclusion: The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed the petition for post-arrest bail, emphasizing the serious nature of the charges and the substantial incriminating evidence against the petitioner. The Court highlighted that the observations were tentative and should not influence the merits of the case at trial. The petitioner's counter version of the incident was not sufficient to outweigh the evidence presented by the prosecution. Order: Petition dismissed.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, Muhammad Saleem, filed a suit challenging the decisions of the Family Court and the Appellate Court regarding maintenance allowance and monetary claims related to a family dispute. The trial court's judgment partially favored the plaintiffs, awarding maintenance allowances but rejecting claims for past maintenance and recovery of gold ornaments. The petitioner appealed, but the Appellate Court dismissed his appeal. Subsequent legal maneuvers by the petitioner, including filing writ petitions and making accusations against his counsel, led to further complications and costs imposed by the Lahore High Court. ----Issues: 1) Whether the petitioner\u2019s objections to the reserve price and auction proceedings were valid. ----2) Whether the Lahore High Court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s writ petition and the imposition of costs were justified. ---3) Whether the petitioner should be granted leniency regarding the costs and allowed to satisfy the judgment in installments. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Validity of Petitioner's Objections: The petitioner\u2019s appeal and subsequent writ petitions were found to be frivolous and vexatious, aimed at delaying the execution of the trial court's decree. The Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts, finding no merit in the petitioner\u2019s claims. High Court\u2019s Decision: The Lahore High Court's decision to impose a cost of Rs. 50,000/- on the petitioner was upheld. The Court noted the petitioner\u2019s misconduct in concealing facts and making false accusations against his lawyers, which justified the imposition of costs. Leniency and Installments: The Supreme Court found no convincing reason to waive the costs imposed by the Lahore High Court. Additionally, the petitioner\u2019s request to satisfy the judgment in installments was denied, as no such application had been made before the Executing Court. ---Citations/Precedents: Judicial Statistics, 2nd Bi-Annual Report (July-December 2023), Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan Qazi Naveed ul Islam v. District Judge, Gujrat, PLD 2023 SC 298 National Highway Authority v. Sambu Construction, 2023 SCMR 1103 ---Conclusion: The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed the petition, refusing leave to appeal and upholding the imposition of costs by the Lahore High Court. The petitioner\u2019s requests for leniency and installment payments were denied, emphasizing the need to discourage frivolous litigation and maintain the integrity of the judicial process. The Court highlighted the petitioner\u2019s misuse of the legal system to delay the execution of lawful judgments and impose unnecessary burdens on the judiciary.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Niaz Ahmed (Petitioner No.1) and his wife (Petitioner No.2) challenged the judgment dated February 23, 2024, by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi. The High Court had dismissed their Criminal Revision Applications No. 219 of 2021 and 262 of 2022. The dispute centers around the ownership and possession of a four-storey house in Shah Faisal Colony, Karachi, which was initially owned by their deceased brother Iftikhar. Iftikhar had transferred the property to Aijaz Ahmed (Respondent No.1) via an oral gift declaration before his death. After Iftikhar's death, Niaz Ahmed and his wife allegedly broke into the house and occupied the fourth floor, leading to a legal battle under the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005. --- Issues: 1) Whether the proceedings under the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 (IDA, 2005) are applicable against family members. --- 2) Whether the interim relief under Section 7 of IDA, 2005, was rightly granted to the respondent. --- 3) Whether the application for acquittal under Section 265-K of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Cr.P.C) was rightly dismissed. ---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Scope and Applicability of IDA, 2005: The Court held that IDA, 2005, is applicable to any unlawful occupant, not just Qabza Mafia or land grabbers. The legislation protects legitimate owners and occupants from being unlawfully dispossessed, regardless of the offender's relationship to the owner. Section 7 of IDA, 2005: The Court affirmed that interim relief under Section 7 could be granted during the trial if it is prima facie established that the accused is not in lawful possession. The Court found that the respondent had a prima facie case while the petitioners could not justify their possession. Section 265-K of Cr.P.C: The Court explained that Section 265-K allows acquittal at any stage if there is no probability of conviction. The petitioners failed to establish extraordinary circumstances or grounds for acquittal. Therefore, their application was rightly dismissed. ----Citations/Precedents: Mumtaz Hussain vs. Dr. Nasir Khan and others [2010 SCMR 1254] The scope of IDA, 2005, is wide enough to cover any illegal occupant, not limited to Qabza Mafia.

The Family Court ruled in favor of the Respondent, ordering the Petitioner to pay maintenance and return dowry articles or their equivalent value. The Petitioner appealed to the Additional District Judge and then to the High Court of Sindh, both of which upheld the original decision. The Petitioner subsequently filed a petition under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, before the Supreme Court. ----Issues: 1) Whether the Family Court and subsequent appellate courts correctly appreciated the evidence on record. ---2) Whether the High Court appropriately exercised its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution. ---3) Whether the Supreme Court can interfere with the concurrent findings of fact by the lower courts. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, refusing to grant leave to appeal. The Supreme Court emphasized its limited role in reviewing concurrent findings of fact unless there is a manifest illegality or a grave miscarriage of justice. The Family Courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters related to marriage dissolution, dowry, and maintenance as per the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. The High Court correctly identified that it should not interfere unless there was a clear legal error. The Supreme Court reiterated that its jurisdiction under Article 185(3) is guided by principles of self-restraint and is not a forum for re-evaluating evidence unless there is a significant legal question or injustice. The petitioner's argument regarding the alleged fabricated list of dowry articles was a factual inquiry already addressed by the Family Court and the Appellate Court, which the High Court and Supreme Court cannot reassess. The Supreme Court highlighted the importance of finality in legal proceedings and the intent of the legislature to limit prolonged litigation in family matters. ----Citations/Precedents: Sardar Ali Khan v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail granted ---- Background: Ali Anwar Paracha, the petitioner, sought post-arrest bail after the Islamabad High Court declined his request. An FIR (No. 751) was lodged against him on October 5, 2023, at Police Station Lohi Bher under Section 489-F PPC. The FIR alleged that the complainant had given Rs. 70 million to the petitioner (with Rs. 31.79 million through bank transactions and the remainder in cash). The petitioner issued a cheque (No. D-02277122) worth Rs. 50 million to the complainant, which was dishonored when presented at the bank. -----Issues: Whether the petitioner was falsely implicated in the case with mala fide intentions. Whether the failure to provide specific details about the business transaction and receipts for the cash amount affects the validity of the complaint. Whether the nature of the offense and the punishment prescribed under Section 489-F PPC warrants the granting of post-arrest bail. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: False Implication and Mala Fide Intentions: The petitioner argued that the case against him was fabricated with ulterior motives, highlighting a previously cancelled FIR against him. The court acknowledged the possibility of mala fide intentions due to family conflicts over business dealings. Details of Business Transaction: The complainant failed to provide specific details or receipts for the cash transactions alleged in the FIR. The court noted that the foundational elements of an offense under Section 489-F PPC include the issuance of a cheque with dishonest intent towards repayment of a loan or obligation, which needs to be determined at trial. Nature of Offense and Punishment: The court emphasized that the offense under Section 489-F PPC does not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C., as the maximum punishment is three years. Citing precedent cases, the court reiterated that granting bail in such offenses is a rule and refusal is an exception. ----Outcome: The Supreme Court converted the petition into an appeal and allowed it, setting aside the Islamabad High Court's order dated February 29, 2024. The petitioner was granted post-arrest bail upon furnishing surety bonds of Rs. 100,000 and a personal recognizance bond of the same amount. The trial court was directed to adjudicate the case independently without being influenced by the observations made by the Supreme Court. ----Citations/Precedents: Taha Bashir v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail granted ---- The petitioner, sought pre-arrest bail after the Lahore High Court, Lahore, declined his request. An FIR (No. 309/2023) was lodged against him on January 15, 2023, at Police Station Nishtar Colony, Lahore, under sections 448, 440, 511, 427, 148, 149, PPC. The FIR alleged that on the said date, the petitioner and co-accused, armed with firearms, forcibly entered the housing society of the complainant, fired indiscriminately, injuring a passerby, and damaging property including the gate and building of the office. ----Issues: Whether the petitioner was falsely implicated in the FIR due to mala fide intentions and ulterior motives. Whether the presence of family conflicts and cross-versions of the incident warranted the granting of pre-arrest bail. Whether the lack of police investigation into the alleged injury of a passerby raised further questions about the petitioner\u2019s guilt. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: False Implication and Family Conflicts: The court recognized the ongoing family conflicts over the ownership and management of the Formanites Housing Society, founded by the petitioner\u2019s late father. Given the potential for malafide intentions and false implications arising from these disputes, the court found merit in the petitioner\u2019s claim of being falsely implicated. Cross-Versions and Further Inquiry: The court noted that in cases of cross-versions arising from the same incident, bail is typically granted to allow further inquiry. The petitioner alleged that the complainant party was the aggressor, which required a detailed investigation to ascertain the truth. Precedents cited included Fazal Muhammad (1976 SCMR 391), Shafiq-ur-Rehman (1972 SCMR 682), and Khalid Mahmood (2013 SCMR 1415). Lack of Investigation into Injury: The FIR mentioned an injury to passerby Zeeshan Haider due to the firing, but the police conducted no investigation into this injury. This omission raised further doubts about the prosecution\u2019s case, leading the court to classify the matter as one requiring further inquiry. ----Outcome: The Supreme Court converted the petition into an appeal and allowed it. The impugned order of the Lahore High Court dated November 13, 2023, was set aside. The petitioner was granted pre-arrest bail upon furnishing surety bonds of Rs. 100,000 and a personal recognizance bond of the same amount. The court emphasized that these observations were tentative and that the trial court was free to adjudicate the case independently based on its merits. -----Citations/Precedents: Fazal Muhammad (1976 SCMR 391) Shafiq-ur-Rehman (1972 SCMR 682) Khalid Mahmood (2013 SCMR 1415) ----Notes: The case highlights the importance of a thorough investigation, especially when there are cross-versions and potential false implications due to family disputes. The decision underscores the principle that bail should be granted in cases requiring further inquiry.",

The court ordered the implementation of the recommendations provided by the Commissioner who inspected the hospital's premises. A compliance report is to be submitted by the official respondents before the next hearing. The court observed that medical facilities, particularly in rural areas of Sindh Province, have significantly deteriorated, violating Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

The motive was related to a family dispute over the appellant's divorce from the deceased's daughter. Trial and Evidence: The appellant was charged and tried, with the prosecution presenting eight witnesses. The complainant, Raheem Khan, and an eyewitness provided accounts of the incident. The investigation included collecting blood-stained earth and .30 bore empties from the scene, which were confirmed by a firearms expert to have been fired from one weapon. Defense and Absence of Contradiction: The appellant denied guilt but did not present evidence in his defense. The court found the prosecution witnesses credible, noting the absence of contradictions in their statements and the support from medical evidence aligning with the ocular account. Motive and Relationship: The court recognized the established relationship and motive due to the family dispute. The appellant's abscondance following the incident was considered supportive of the prosecution's case.

Imran Mehmood vs. The State and another (2023 SCMR 795): Discussed the rarity of false implication in cases involving single accused. ----Conclusion: Criminal Appeal: The court dismissed the criminal appeal, affirming the life imprisonment sentence. The prosecution's evidence was deemed credible, and the trial court's judgment was upheld. Criminal Revision: The court also dismissed the criminal revision for enhancing the sentence to the death penalty, citing the unclear motive and circumstances leading to the killing. The trial court's decision to award life imprisonment was considered justified. Outcome: Both the criminal appeal and the criminal revision were dismissed, and the trial court's judgment was upheld without any changes.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, Haji Saif-ur-Rahman Shaheen, challenged the decree of Khula (dissolution of marriage) granted by the Family Judge, Jhang, on 18.05.2022, under Section 10(5) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 (Amended 2015). The petitioner also sought the invalidation of this judgment and a subsequent writ petition dismissal by the Lahore High Court on 20.09.2022. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court's decree of Khula under Section 10(5) was valid, given the section was declared against Islamic injunctions. 2- Whether Khula is an absolute right of a woman in Islam, and what are the necessary requirements to obtain it. 3- Whether a Judge can grant Khula when demanded by a wife without the husband's consent. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Invalidation of Section 10(5): Section 10(5) of the Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015, had already been declared against the injunctions of Islam by the Federal Shariat Court in its judgment dated 17.02.2022 (PLD 2022 FSC 25). The Family Court, Jhang's decree on 18.05.2022, was thus based on an ineffective provision. --Absolute Right of Khula: Khula is a fundamental right granted to women by Islam, based on the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. A woman can claim a decree for Khula from a court of law by stating her dislike for her husband and her inability to live with him within the limits prescribed by Allah. This does not require proving maltreatment or mistreatment. --Judicial Grant of Khula: The court can grant Khula if a wife demands it and is willing to return her Mahar (dower). The court must grant the decree without delay if the wife expresses her intent to return the Mahar in exchange for Khula. Additionally, if the wife claims ill-treatment, the court can adjust the amount of compensation based on the circumstances. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine as it sought an in-personam relief, which is outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court. The judgment highlighted that the decree of Khula granted by the Family Court was based on an invalid provision, reinforcing that the right of Khula is an absolute right of a woman in Islam. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2022 FSC 25 (Imran Anwar Khan v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: In Shariat Petition No. 11-I/2022, the petitioner challenged Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, arguing that it allows Khula (dissolution of marriage initiated by the wife) without the husband's consent, which he claimed is against Islamic injunctions. The petitioner sought to have this section declared un-Islamic and void, and to have the law amended to require the husband's consent for Khula. ----Issues: 1- Whether Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, allowing Khula without the husband's consent, is against Islamic injunctions. 2- Whether the Family Court's decision granting Khula to the petitioner's wife without his consent is valid under Islamic law. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Validity of Section 10(4): The Full Bench of the Federal Shariat Court in \u201cSaleem Ahmad and others v. Government of Pakistan and others\u201d (PLD 2014 FSC 43) had already addressed the issue. It was held that courts of competent jurisdiction could decree Khula when reconciliation fails, even without the husband's consent. This decision affirms that Section 10(4) does not violate Islamic injunctions. --Judicial Authority to Grant Khula: The court emphasized that the judiciary has the authority to dissolve marriages, including Khula, if reconciliation fails. This authority is supported by Islamic principles, as courts are established to resolve disputes, including those involving marriage dissolution. --Legal Effect of Khula: The court reiterated that Khula operates as a single irrevocable divorce, allowing both parties to remarry each other without an intermediary marriage, unlike in the case of a triple talaq where halala (intermediary marriage) is required. The court noted that Iddat (waiting period) applies to the wife if she wishes to remarry after Khula. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine, as the court found no merit in the petitioner's arguments. The court upheld the earlier judgment of the Full Bench and confirmed that Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, allowing Khula without the husband's consent, is consistent with Islamic law. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2014 FSC 43 (Saleem Ahmad and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners sought to receive a share from the pensionary funds of the late Dr. Azmat Hayat Khan, who was a civil servant and died during his tenure. They argued that these funds should be considered as \"Tarka\" (inheritance) and distributed accordingly. The petitioners also requested the court to ensure that parents of deceased civil servants automatically receive their due share of pension and other emoluments. ----Issues: 1- Whether pensionary benefits of a deceased person fall within the definition of \"Tarka\" (inheritance) under Islamic law. 2- Whether the Federal Shariat Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioners. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Definition of \"Tarka\": The court reiterated that pensionary benefits do not fall within the definition of \"Tarka\" and are governed by the departmental Pensionary Rules. The court noted that for the purpose of pensionary benefits, the employer is at liberty to define the family. Pensionary benefits are not subject to inheritance laws but are governed by specific rules laid out by the employer. --Jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court: The court emphasized that a Shariat Petition under Article 203-D of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, requires the petitioner to identify a specific law or rule that is against the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran and Sunnah. The petitioners failed to identify any such law or rule. The relief sought by the petitioners was in personam (individual relief), which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court. The court's jurisdiction is limited to examining whether laws or rules are in accordance with Islamic injunctions, not to grant specific individual relief. The Shariat Petition was dismissed in limine due to lack of maintainability. The court found that pensionary benefits do not constitute \"Tarka\" and are not subject to inheritance laws. Additionally, the petitioners failed to meet the constitutional requirement of identifying any law or rule against the injunctions of Islam. The court does not have jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by the petitioners. ----Citations/Precedents: \"Federation of Pakistan v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners filed a Shariat Petition challenging Section 346 of the Muhammadan Law, which pertains to the adoption of a son. The core issue revolves around whether the adoption of a child in Islam permits the change of the child's family name, as the petitioners argue that adoption does not alter the child's relationship with their biological parents and siblings. ----Issues: 1- Whether the adoption of a child in Islam allows for changing the child's family name. 2- Whether the orders passed by the courts below, including the Lahore High Court, were erroneous and against the injunctions of Islam. 3- Whether the petition falls within the scope of a Shariat Petition under Article 203B(c) of the Constitution of Pakistan. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the Shariat Petition on the following grounds: The petitioners were seeking personal relief regarding the change of surname for an adopted child, which is beyond the scope of a Shariat Petition. The Court observed that the petitioners were involved in litigation before different fora concerning the change of surname of an adopted child. The Lahore High Court had already decided the matter in a related case (W.P. No.59749/2021), dismissing the petition based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Mst. Laila Qayyum v. Fawad Qayum (PLD 2019 SC 449). The Court reaffirmed that the \"Principles of Muhammadan Law\" authored by Dinshah Fardunji Mullah is only a reference book without the force of law and does not fall under the ambit of law as provided under Article 203-B(c) of the Constitution. The petition was deemed not maintainable under Clause (c) of Article 203B of the Constitution, as the Court had previously addressed the matter in the case of M/s Najaat Welfare Foundation v.

The petitioner raised ten questions regarding various aspects of Islamic law, focusing on the right of a Muslim woman to seek Khula (dissolution of marriage) and the legal implications of such actions under Islamic jurisprudence. ----Issues: 1- Whether Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam concerning the process of Khula. 2- Whether the questions raised by the petitioner are relevant and substantial for the Federal Shariat Court's consideration. 3- Whether the procedural requirements of filing a Shariat Petition were met by the petitioner. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petition was dismissed in limine (at the outset) as it was deemed not maintainable. The court identified that the petitioner failed to adhere to the procedural requirements set by the Federal Shariat Court (Procedure) Rules, 1981. Specifically, the petition did not properly describe the law considered repugnant, nor did it provide relevant Quranic verses or Hadiths to support the claims. Additionally, the court found that the questions raised were largely irrelevant, ambiguous, and did not directly pertain to any actionable legal provisions. The court also noted that Section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act had already been reviewed in a previous case (PLD 2014 FSC 43), with an appeal pending before the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. The petition was dismissed due to non-compliance with procedural rules and lack of substantive legal grounds. -----Citations/Precedents: Saleem Ahmad and others vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2014 FSC 43).",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellant, injured during a robbery, appealed against the acquittal of three respondents who were accused of forcibly entering the appellant\u2019s house, committing robbery, and causing injuries to him and his family members. The trial court had acquitted the respondents due to insufficient evidence, prompting the appellant to challenge this decision in the Federal Shariat Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting the respondents despite the evidence presented by the prosecution. 2- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR and recording the statements of the witnesses affected the credibility of the prosecution's case. 3- Whether the prosecution's evidence, including medical reports and witness testimonies, was sufficient to prove the respondents' guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court upheld the trial court's decision, dismissing the appeal and maintaining the acquittal of the respondents. Delay in FIR and Statements: The FIR was lodged more than three hours after the incident, despite the police station being nearby. This delay, coupled with the unexplained six-day gap in recording the witnesses' statements, raised serious doubts about the credibility of the prosecution's case. The court found that this delay could have allowed for fabrication of the case against the respondents. Lack of Specific Roles: The prosecution failed to assign specific roles to the respondents in the FIR. The witnesses' testimonies were inconsistent, with some not implicating the respondents at all, and there were contradictions regarding the sequence of events and injuries sustained by the victims. Medical Evidence: The medical evidence conflicted with the ocular account. The injuries described by the witnesses did not match the medical reports, and crucial details were omitted or inconsistent, further weakening the prosecution's case. Principles of Acquittal: The court reiterated that in appeals against acquittal, the respondents enjoy a double presumption of innocence. The appellant failed to prove that the trial court's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or based on a misreading of the evidence. The acquittal was found to be in line with the evidence presented. The appeal was dismissed, and the acquittal of the respondents was upheld. ----Citations/Precedents: Akhtar Ali and Others v. The State (2008 SCMR 6) - Importance of timely FIR lodging. Ayub Masih v.

The petitioners argued that these sections, which give discretionary power to Family Courts to attempt reconciliation between conflicting spouses during pre-trial proceedings, are un-Islamic. They contended that reconciliation should be mandatory, citing Ayat 35 of Surah Nisa and relevant Hadiths. ----Issues: Whether Section 10(3) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, and the corresponding section of the Family Courts Act, 1964 (as amended for Punjab), are repugnant to the injunctions of Islam, specifically concerning the mandatory nature of reconciliation efforts in family disputes. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the petition, holding that the petitioners' interpretation of the Quran and Sunnah in relation to Section 10(3) was misconceived. The Court emphasized that while Islam places significant importance on the protection of the family unit and encourages reconciliation in the event of marital disputes, the relevant sections of the Family Courts Act already provide for reconciliation efforts. The Court noted that Ayat 35 of Surah Nisa addresses the responsibility of family members and elders, not the legal obligation of the courts. The Court affirmed that the discretionary power given to Family Courts to attempt reconciliation is consistent with Islamic teachings and does not require amendment. ----Citations/Precedents: Sh.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant, a resident of Penorai, District Swat, filed a complaint under Section 5 of the Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979, after the respondent accused her of committing zina (fornication). The complaint followed the respondent\u2019s failure to produce any witness to substantiate his allegations before a local Jirga and his subsequent refusal to apologize as promised. The trial court acquitted the respondent on January 15, 2019, prompting the appellant to file this appeal, seeking to overturn the acquittal and convict the respondent. -----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting the respondent of the charge of Qazf despite the evidence presented. 2- Whether the delay in filing the complaint was justifiable given the nature of the Qazf offense. 3- Whether the trial court failed to adhere to the mandatory legal provisions and properly assess the evidence in the case. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Federal Shariat Court found that the trial court did not properly follow the legal procedures required for a Qazf case. The court noted several key points: --Delay in Filing the Complaint: The court emphasized that in Qazf cases, the delay in filing a complaint should not be treated as fatal to the case. Given the sensitive nature of Qazf and the social repercussions, delay is both natural and permissible under Islamic law. The court cited Islamic jurisprudence, which allows for delays in such cases due to the involvement of the victim's family and the severity of the allegations. Procedural Errors: The trial court failed to adhere to the mandatory provisions of Section 367 Cr.P.C., which requires the judgment to clearly state the points for determination, decisions thereon, and the reasons for such decisions. The court also noted that the trial was not conducted in accordance with Section 203-B Cr.P.C., which outlines the process for handling Qazf cases. Assessment of Evidence: The appellant provided sufficient evidence to support her claim, including a medical certificate proving her virginity, which fulfilled the requirement of being a \"muhsan\" (chaste person) under Section 5 of the Qazf Ordinance. The trial court\u2019s dismissal of the case based on the delay and enmity between the parties was deemed incorrect. Apology Consideration: The respondent expressed willingness to tender an unconditional apology. The court clarified that the acceptance of such an apology depends on the complainant\u2019s willingness and the trial court\u2019s assessment. As a result, the Federal Shariat Court set aside the trial court\u2019s judgment dated January 15, 2019, and remanded the case for a de novo trial. The trial court was instructed to conduct the trial in accordance with the relevant laws within two months. -----Citations/Precedents: Rafiullah vs. The State (2006 SCMR 1594) Muddassar alias Jimmi vs. The State (1996 SCMR 3) Abdullah Jan vs. The State and others (2019 SCMR 1079) Sahab Khan and 4 others vs. The State and others (1997 SCMR 871) Fiaz Ahmad and another vs. The State and another (PLD 2018 FSC 6) The appeal was disposed of, and the trial court was directed to conduct a new trial in accordance with the Qazf Ordinance and relevant laws.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: In this case, the appellants were convicted under Section 17(3) of the Offences Against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and Sections 452 and 506(2) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The incident occurred on March 31, 2015, when the complainant and his family were allegedly robbed at gunpoint by six armed individuals, three of whom were identified. The trial court sentenced the appellants to seven years of rigorous imprisonment, along with additional sentences under the PPC. The appellants challenged their conviction and sentence, raising several issues regarding the legality and fairness of the trial. ----Issues: 1- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR and recording the statements of the witnesses affected the credibility of the prosecution's case. 2- Whether the identification of the appellants was conducted in a manner consistent with legal standards. 3- Whether the recovery of stolen property was properly substantiated by evidence. Whether the contradictions and inconsistencies in witness testimonies cast doubt on the prosecution's case. 4- Whether the trial court properly evaluated the evidence and whether the convictions were legally sustainable. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delay in Lodging FIR and Recording Witness Statements: The court found that the delay in lodging the FIR (9 days after the incident) and the further delay in recording the witnesses' statements were significant. These delays were not properly explained, leading to a suspicion that the prosecution's case may have been fabricated after due deliberation. The court cited precedents indicating that such delays, without proper explanation, could be fatal to the prosecution's case. --Identification of Appellants: The court noted that no identification parade was conducted for the appellants who were not named in the FIR. The complainant's subsequent identification of these appellants, made after a considerable delay, lacked credibility. The court emphasized that proper identification procedures are crucial, especially when the accused were not initially known to the witnesses. --Recovery of Stolen Property: The court observed that the recovery of the stolen property was not properly documented or substantiated. The alleged recovery was made from an open and accessible location, and the property was not produced during the trial. Additionally, the recovery process lacked transparency and did not comply with mandatory legal procedures, such as the involvement of independent witnesses. --Contradictions and Inconsistencies: The court highlighted multiple contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, including discrepancies regarding the presence of certain family members during the incident, the time taken for the robbery, and the exact sequence of events. These inconsistencies further weakened the prosecution's case. --Evaluation of Evidence by the Trial Court: The court concluded that the trial court failed to properly evaluate the evidence and overlooked significant contradictions and procedural lapses. The misreading and non-reading of the evidence by the trial court led to a conviction that could not be legally sustained. The court allowed the appeals, setting aside the conviction and sentences awarded to the appellants. The appellants were acquitted of all charges and ordered to be released immediately if not required in any other case. The judgment emphasized the importance of proper legal procedures and credible evidence in sustaining criminal convictions. ----Citations/Precedents: AKHTAR ALI and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Mst. Naseema Bibi, the appellant, filed a complaint under Section 7 of the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979, against Murad, the respondent, accusing him of making a false allegation of zina (fornication) against her. Naseema Bibi, a married woman with a husband working in Saudi Arabia, alleged that Murad falsely claimed she was pregnant with an illegitimate child. This accusation was made public, causing significant damage to her reputation and that of her family. After undergoing medical tests that confirmed she was not pregnant, Naseema Bibi filed the complaint. The trial court, however, acquitted Murad, leading to this appeal. ----Issues: 1) Whether the trial court erred in acquitting Murad despite the evidence presented by Naseema Bibi. ---2) Whether the delay in filing the complaint and the absence of Tazkiyah al-Shuhood (credibility of witnesses) were appropriately considered by the trial court. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Federal Shariat Court accepted the appeal, set aside the trial court's judgment, and remanded the case for re-writing the judgment. The court provided the following reasoning: Tazkiyah al-Shuhood: The trial court acquitted the respondent on the grounds that the prosecution witnesses did not meet the criteria for Tazkiyah al-Shuhood, a mandatory requirement in cases of Hadd. However, the trial court failed to provide clear reasons or evidence to support this conclusion. The Federal Shariat Court emphasized the importance of properly evaluating the credibility of witnesses and providing cogent reasons if they are found lacking. Delay in Filing the Complaint: The trial court viewed the one-month delay in reporting the matter as a sign of possible deliberation or false implication. The Federal Shariat Court rejected this reasoning, noting that in cases of Qazf, where honor and reputation are at stake, some delay is natural and permissible under Islamic law. The court cited Islamic jurisprudence that allows for delays in such cases due to the sensitive nature of the allegations. Evidence Misinterpretation: The trial court misread the evidence, particularly regarding the relationship between the complainant\u2019s father-in-law and the accused. The court also wrongly disregarded key medical evidence, such as the negative pregnancy test, due to a minor typographical error on the ultrasound report. The Federal Shariat Court found these errors to be significant enough to warrant a retrial. Non-Compliance with Section 367 Cr.P.C.: The trial court's judgment did not comply with the mandatory requirements of Section 367 Cr.P.C., which requires the judgment to contain points for determination, decisions on those points, and reasons for the decisions. The Federal Shariat Court held that this failure alone was sufficient to vitiate the judgment. ----Citations/Precedents: Sanaullah vs. The State (PLD 1991 FSC 186): Discusses the concept of Tazkiyah al-Shuhood and its application in cases of Hadd.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: This case involves an appeal against the conviction and sentence of Muhammad and Muhammad Ashraf, the appellants, who were accused of committing Qatl-e-Amad (intentional murder) under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), along with charges under Section 457 for trespassing and other related offenses. The case stemmed from the murder of Muhammad Uris, and the appellants were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Sessions Judge, Badin. Issues: Whether the appellants were rightly convicted based on the evidence provided. Whether the trial court followed due process in evaluating the evidence and testimonies. Whether the failure to cross-examine or produce key witnesses affected the fairness of the trial. Whether the appellants' appeal should be accepted, resulting in acquittal, given the inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. Court's Analysis: Inconsistencies in Witness Testimonies: The court reviewed the statements of the main witnesses, PWs 2 to 4 (the family of the deceased) and found significant contradictions between their statements in court and those recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The witnesses changed key details, such as where the murder occurred (inside or outside the room) and whether they saw the accused commit the crime. These discrepancies seriously undermined the prosecution's case. Delay in Reporting and Recording Statements: The First Information Report (FIR) was filed several hours after the incident, and statements from key witnesses were recorded 27 days later. The court found this delay unexplained and noted that such a significant delay, combined with the changes in witness testimonies, raised serious doubts about the authenticity of the prosecution's story. Failure to Produce Crucial Evidence and Witnesses: The court noted the absence of key investigative actions, such as the failure to collect blood-stained earth from the crime scene or to properly document the presence of a light source (such as a bulb) through which the witnesses allegedly saw the accused. Additionally, the Investigating Officer (I.O.) was not produced for cross-examination, which deprived the defense of a critical opportunity to challenge the investigation. Contradictory Behavior of Witnesses: The court expressed concern over the behavior of witnesses, who initially failed to name the accused due to alleged fear but later identified them after the arrest. The court found it implausible that the family members of the deceased would not disclose the identity of the murderers for such an extended period. Application of Legal Principles: The court applied the principle of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus (false in one thing, false in everything), noting that the witnesses' contradictions on material points made their entire testimony unreliable. The court emphasized that in criminal cases, the benefit of doubt must be given to the accused, especially when the prosecution's evidence is weak and inconsistent. Judgment: The Federal Shariat Court found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court highlighted that the trial court had misread the evidence, and the investigation was flawed. As a result, the conviction and sentence were set aside, and the appellants were honorably acquitted of all charges. The appellants' bail bonds were discharged. Observations: The court noted serious deficiencies in the trial process, including the excessive time taken (seven years) to conclude the trial, frequent adjournments, and the failure of both the defense counsel and the trial court to adequately protect the rights of the accused. The court criticized the Investigating Officer and prosecution for their poor handling of the case and recommended that the judgment be forwarded to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Sindh for further review of the trial judge's conduct. Outcome: The appeal was allowed, and the conviction and sentence were quashed. The court issued directives for the judgment to be noted in the personal file of the trial judge for accountability.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal --- Facts: This case involves a dispute between Syed Sajjad Haider Naqvi and his wife Mst. Ghazala Fatima (Petitioners) against Mst. Sadia Bibi and her father Zareen Shah (Respondents). The conflict arose after Sadia Bibi, Naqvi's ex-wife, and her father allegedly accused Naqvi and Ghazala Fatima of committing Zina (adultery). The accusations were reportedly made during court proceedings in a family suit. Subsequently, Naqvi and Ghazala Fatima filed a complaint under Section 7 of the Offence of Qazf (Enforcement of Hadd) Ordinance, 1979, accusing Sadia Bibi and her father of false imputation of adultery. --- Issues: 1) Whether the accusations of Zina made by the Respondents during court proceedings amount to Qazf under the Ordinance. ---2) Whether the trial court correctly acquitted the Respondents based on the evidence presented. --3) Whether the statements made by the Respondents were protected under the exceptions of Section 3 of the Qazf Ordinance. ---4) Whether the court can grant special leave to appeal against the acquittal judgment. ---Court's Analysis: Accusation of Zina and Imputation of Qazf: The court carefully examined the evidence, including the statements of the Petitioners and witnesses. The Petitioners claimed that the Respondents had falsely accused them of living together after divorce, which they argued amounted to Zina. However, the Respondents clarified that their statements were based on a divorce deed and were made in good faith, without malicious intent. --- The court noted that PW-1 (Syed Sajjad Haider Naqvi), during his testimony, admitted that Mst. Sadia Bibi had not explicitly accused him and his wife of Zina. The accusations were related to a dispute over a forged divorce deed, and no direct allegations of adultery were made. ---- Protection under Exception of Section 3 of the Ordinance: The court observed that the statements made by the Respondents were based on a divorce deed, which the Petitioners had not challenged before any competent authority. The Respondents' statements were made in the context of a legal dispute and fell within the exception of Section 3 of the Qazf Ordinance, which protects statements made in good faith during court proceedings. ---- Appreciation of Evidence and Acquittal: The trial court had thoroughly examined the evidence and concluded that the Petitioners had failed to establish the essential elements of Qazf. The court emphasized that the offense of Qazf requires clear and unambiguous imputation of Zina, which was not present in this case. Furthermore, the Petitioners themselves had admitted that no direct allegations of Zina were made by the Respondents. --- Scope of Appeal Against Acquittal: The court highlighted that the scope of appeal against an acquittal is limited, and an acquitted accused enjoys the presumption of innocence. The court found that the trial court's judgment was based on a correct appreciation of the evidence, and there were no grounds to interfere with the acquittal. --- Judgment: The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the petition for special leave to appeal, upholding the acquittal of the Respondents. The court concluded that the Petitioners had failed to prove the offense of Qazf beyond a reasonable doubt, and the statements made by the Respondents were protected under the good faith exception in Section 3 of the Qazf Ordinance. --- Outcome: The petition for special leave to appeal was dismissed. The acquittal of Mst. Sadia Bibi and Zareen Shah was upheld.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners, both serving as Medical Officers at Pakistan Ordnance Factories (POF), Wah Cantt, challenged the POF's housing policy, which restricts the allotment of residential plots to only one plot per working couple, even if both spouses are employed by POF. The petitioners argued that this policy is against the injunctions of Islam, contending that both husband and wife have independent rights and should be entitled to separate plots. ----Issues: 1- Whether the policy restricting the allotment of only one residential plot to a working couple, even if both are employed, is against the injunctions of Islam. 2- Whether the POF's policy violates the principles of justice by depriving one spouse of the right to a residential plot. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Islamic Injunctions and Policy Review: The court held that the policy does not violate Islamic injunctions. The rationale behind the policy is to ensure that as many employees as possible are accommodated, given the limited number of available plots. The court emphasized that Islamic principles of justice and fairness support the idea of distributing resources in a manner that benefits the larger community, rather than granting multiple plots to a single family. --Application of Justice: The court found that the policy is justified based on the limited availability of plots and the need to prioritize employees who do not own any residential plot. Allocating two plots to one family, when many other employees have not been allotted even one plot, would lead to an unjust distribution of resources. The petition was dismissed as being misconceived. The court upheld the POF policy, emphasizing that it aligns with the principles of justice and equity as prescribed by Islamic teachings. The petitioners\u2019 demand for two separate plots was deemed inconsistent with the broader objectives of fairness and welfare. ----Citations/Precedents: Holy Quran Verses: Quran 6:132: \"To all are degrees (or ranks), according to their deeds: For thy Lord is not unmindful of anything that they do.\" Quran 16:97: \"Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has Faith, verily, to him will We give a new Life, a life that is good and pure, and We will bestow on such their reward according to the best of their actions.\" Hadith References: Sahih Muslim: Emphasized the spirit of sharing resources with those in need rather than hoarding surplus. Previous Judgment Reference: Shariat Petition No. 8/1 of 2004 and linked petitions: Related to house rent allowance but distinguished as not applicable to the allotment of residential plots, which are not a guaranteed right but a discretionary benefit. This case emphasizes the principle that in an Islamic welfare state, policies must ensure equitable distribution of limited resources, prioritizing those in greater need to uphold justice and fairness.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellant filed a criminal appeal challenging the acquittal of the respondent, Shahid, by the Additional Sessions Judge-II, Mardan. The case revolves around a robbery that allegedly occurred on November 20, 2009, where Shahid and several other co-accused were accused of storming into the appellant's house, holding the family at gunpoint, and stealing cash, mobile phones, and gold ornaments. The FIR was lodged 33 days after the incident, with the complainant claiming he was gathering information about the culprits. ----Issues: 1- Whether the acquittal of Shahid by the trial court was justified based on the evidence presented. 2- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR and the lack of proper identification of the accused and stolen property impact the credibility of the prosecution's case. 3- Whether the appellate court should interfere with the trial court's acquittal based on the evidence and legal standards. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delay in FIR and Lack of Identification: The court noted the significant delay of 33 days in lodging the FIR without sufficient explanation, raising doubts about the genuineness of the allegations. The complainant failed to identify the culprits by their features during the incident, and there was no proper identification parade conducted. Additionally, the stolen property recovered from the accused could not be conclusively identified as belonging to the complainant. --Prosecution's Failure to Prove the Case: The court held that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence presented was inconsistent and contradictory, particularly regarding the identification of the accused and the stolen property. The trial court rightly extended the benefit of the doubt to the accused, leading to his acquittal. --Scope of Appellate Review: The court reiterated that interference with an acquittal is limited and should only occur if the trial court's decision is perverse or arbitrary. Since the prosecution's evidence was not compelling, and the trial court's reasoning was sound, the appellate court found no grounds to overturn the acquittal. The appeal was dismissed in limine, meaning it was rejected at the preliminary stage without a full hearing, as it lacked merit. The court upheld the trial court's decision, affirming the acquittal of Shahid. ----Citations/Precedents: 1995 SCMR 1345: Established that a single circumstance creating reasonable doubt entitles the accused to acquittal. 2017 SCMR 633 (Intizar Hussain v. Hamza Ameer, etc.): Reinforced that the presumption of innocence is doubled after acquittal, and appellate courts should be cautious in reversing such decisions. 2008 SCMR 1221 (Ghulam Qadir and others v. The State): Highlighted the need for the prosecution to prove its case beyond any shadow of doubt. FIR and Delay Jurisprudence: The court emphasized that unexplained delays in lodging an FIR could indicate malafide intentions and afterthoughts. The court's decision reflects a careful application of the principles of criminal justice, particularly the importance of reasonable doubt and the limited scope of appellate intervention in cases of acquittal.",

The incident in question occurred on the night of 30th and 31st May 2005, where a group of armed individuals forcibly entered the complainant's house, abducted his daughter, and subsequently committed sexual assault. The appellant, along with other co-accused, was arrested and tried for these offenses. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court correctly convicted and sentenced the appellant under the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and relevant sections of the PPC. 2- Whether the evidence presented, including medical reports and testimonies, sufficiently established the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. 3- Whether the capital sentence imposed under Section 10(4) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, should be confirmed. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Federal Shariat Court upheld the trial court's judgment, affirming the convictions and sentences imposed on the appellant. The court found that the prosecution had presented sufficient evidence, including medical examination reports and testimonies, to establish the appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also confirmed the death sentence under Section 10(4) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, as the crime was committed in a particularly heinous manner. The sentences for other offenses, including abduction and various injuries inflicted on the complainant's family, were also upheld, with the court ruling that all sentences should run concurrently. ----Citations/Precedents: Section 10(4) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 Section 11 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 Section 458 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Section 337-L(2) of PPC Section 337-H(2) of PPC FIR No. 226/2005 Chemical Examiner\u2019s Report (Ex.PU) Medical Certificate (Ex.PS) The court's decision reinforces the strict application of the Hudood Ordinance in cases of zina and underscores the legal principles governing the concurrent running of sentences in the criminal justice system of Pakistan.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Muhammad Hassan challenged Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, arguing that it is inconsistent with Islamic injunctions as per the Holy Qur\u2019an and Sunnah. Section 8 deals with the dissolution of marriage otherwise than by talaq (divorce). The petitioner argued that the provision allows the wife to dissolve the marriage (through Khula) without returning the dower, which he claims contravenes Islamic principles. ----Issues: 1- Constitutionality: The petitioner argued that Section 8 is not in line with Islamic principles and sought its modification to ensure compliance with Sharia. 2- Specific Relief: The petitioner requested that the Court declare the Khula obtained by the respondent against the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah, and that it should be set aside. Additionally, the petitioner sought the return of the wife to perform marital obligations under Islamic law. Court's Findings: 3- Jurisdiction Limitations: The Court highlighted that under Article 203-D and Article 203-B(c) of the Constitution, its jurisdiction is limited. It cannot examine provisions of Muslim Personal Law unless they are unanimously deemed against Islamic injunctions by all sects. The Court can only assess laws based on Qur\u2019an and Sunnah, not on juristic opinions or personal grievances. 4- In Personam Relief: The Court emphasized that it cannot grant relief specific to individual cases in Sharia petitions. The Court\u2019s role is to interpret laws in light of Islamic principles, not to address personal grievances. 5- Dower and Khula: The Court acknowledged that dissolution of marriage via Khula generally requires the return of the dower unless waived by the husband. However, it cannot amend the law or fill gaps; such tasks are within the Parliament's domain. The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the petition as it did not fall within its jurisdiction to address individual grievances or modify the existing legal framework. The petitioner was advised to seek relief through appropriate channels if necessary.",

Key issues included: Delay in FIR Filing: The FIR was lodged three days after the incident, raising concerns about possible consultation and fabrication of evidence. Identification of Accused: The complainant admitted that the faces of the accused were covered during the robbery, making it difficult to identify them. This cast doubt on the accuracy of their identification by the complainant. Recovery of Stolen Items: The prosecution failed to present conclusive evidence that the recovered items belonged to the complainant. The gold recovered exceeded the amount reported stolen, and the weapons recovered were not clearly linked to the accused or properly licensed. Witness Credibility: Several key witnesses were closely related to the complainant, leading the court to question their impartiality and the reliability of their testimonies.

The appellants Fida Hussain, Makhan, and Muhammad Hassan were awarded death and life imprisonment sentences, while Muhammad Ali received a lesser sentence. The prosecution alleged that the appellants, along with others, robbed the complainant\u2019s house, during which the complainant\u2019s son was fatally shot. The appellants were arrested during a police encounter, and the prosecution claimed recovery of stolen items from their possession. ----Issues: 1- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR affects the prosecution's case. 2- Whether the identification parade and the identification of the accused by the witnesses were reliable. 3- Whether the recovery of stolen items from the accused was legitimate and could be used as evidence against them. 4- Whether the contradictions in witness statements and the lack of eyewitness testimony weaken the prosecution's case. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delay in FIR: The court noted the significant delay of five days in lodging the FIR without any plausible explanation. This delay, combined with the complainant's admission of consulting with family before filing the report, raised serious doubts about the authenticity of the prosecution's story. --Identification Parade: The identification of the accused was deemed unreliable. The accused were allegedly masked during the incident, and no specific description was provided in the FIR. The identification parade was held 12 days after the arrest, with no explanation for the delay. The court found this to be highly suspicious and doubted the validity of the identification. --Recovery of Stolen Items: The court questioned the legitimacy of the recovery process. The items were allegedly found after an encounter, but no independent witnesses were involved, which is a violation of Section 103 Cr.P.C. The prosecution's claim that the accused were carrying the stolen items for over a month after the incident was also considered implausible. --Contradictions and Lack of Eyewitness Testimony: The court highlighted contradictions in the statements of the complainant and his wife regarding key details. Additionally, the prosecution failed to produce the only eyewitness, Mst. Saba, who was present during the murder. The absence of independent witnesses and the discrepancies in the testimonies weakened the prosecution's case significantly. The court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The benefit of the doubt was extended to the appellants, leading to their acquittal. The murder reference was answered in the negative, and the appellants were ordered to be released. ----Citations/Precedents: Ahmed Sher v. State (PLD 1995 FSC 20) Muhammad Fayyaz v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petition was filed challenging the amendment to Section 497 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which grants bail concessions exclusively to women accused of certain offenses. The petitioner argued that this amendment is discriminatory, violating the principles of equality and justice as outlined in Islamic law and the Constitution of Pakistan. The petitioner claimed that the law unfairly discriminates against male accused, depriving them of similar bail rights. ----Issues: 1- Does the amendment to Section 497 Cr.P.C., which provides bail concessions only to women accused, violate the principles of equality and justice as per Islamic law? 2- Is the amendment in conflict with Article 25 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guarantees equality before the law? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Jurisdiction and Constitutional Matters: The court noted that it does not have the jurisdiction to interpret Article 25 of the Constitution, as this falls within the exclusive domain of the Supreme Court. However, the court referenced the Supreme Court's decision, which permits reasonable classification based on gender, financial status, or other distinctions that serve a legitimate purpose. --Islamic Perspective: The court evaluated the petition in light of Islamic principles, noting that while equality is fundamental, it does not necessarily mean identical treatment in all circumstances. Islamic teachings recognize different roles and responsibilities for men and women, justifying legal distinctions such as those in Section 497 Cr.P.C. --Social Responsibilities of Women: The court emphasized that women\u2019s unique social roles, particularly in child-rearing and family care, warrant special legal concessions. These distinctions are not discriminatory but rather an acknowledgment of the different circumstances faced by women. The court dismissed the petition, holding that the amendment to Section 497 Cr.P.C. is consistent with both the Constitution and Islamic principles. The bail concession for women accused was upheld as legitimate and non-discriminatory. ----Citations/Precedents: Government of Balochistan Vs.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Conviction upheld----Background: The appellants were convicted by the Sessions Judge/Zillah Qazi Malakand at Batkhela for multiple offenses, including dacoity and rape, and sentenced to life imprisonment under Sections 395, 376, and 457 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The charges stemmed from an incident on 22-04-2012, where the appellants, along with four other unidentified individuals, allegedly entered the complainant's home at night, tied up the family members, looted valuables, and raped the complainant's niece, Mst. Neelam. ----Issues: 1- Whether the prosecution sufficiently proved the involvement of the appellants in the offenses of dacoity and rape. 2- Whether the lack of an identification parade, absence of specific role assignment, and non-recovery of stolen articles from one of the appellants could undermine the conviction. 3- Whether the trial court's enhancement of the sentence under Section 457 PPC from 5 to 10 years was justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Prosecution's Proof of Involvement: The court held that the prosecution had adequately proven the appellants' involvement in the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. The FIR was lodged promptly, and the complainant's testimony, along with the consistent statements of other witnesses, including the victim, Mst. Neelam, corroborated the charges of dacoity and rape. The medical evidence and chemical examiner's report further supported the prosecution's case. --Lack of Identification Parade and Role Assignment: The court dismissed the appellants' arguments regarding the lack of an identification parade, noting that the appellants were named in the FIR, which was filed shortly after the incident. The court also found that the failure to assign specific roles to each accused did not weaken the prosecution's case, as the involvement of the appellants in the offenses was clearly established. --Non-Recovery of Stolen Articles: The court noted that the appellants were arrested three months after the incident, providing them ample time to dispose of the stolen articles. The minimal recovery from Zakirullah and the lack of recovery from Fazal Aziz did not create sufficient doubt to overturn the convictions. --Enhancement of Sentence under Section 457 PPC: The court found that the trial court was justified in enhancing the sentence under Section 457 PPC to 10 years, given the seriousness of the offenses committed during the night. The appeals were dismissed, and the convictions and sentences, including the enhanced sentence under Section 457 PPC, were upheld. The court also ordered that all sentences should run concurrently and extended the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. to the appellants for all sentences. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 1967 Dacca 528: The court referred to this precedent to emphasize that the number of culprits involved in the offense is determined by the evidence and not by the number of persons convicted.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner challenged Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which permits a wife to exercise the right of divorce (Talaq) if it has been delegated to her by her husband. The petitioner argued that this provision, and the corresponding clause in the Nikahnama (marriage contract), was contrary to Islamic injunctions. The petitioner had previously unsuccessfully challenged his ex-wife's exercise of this right in the High Court and the Supreme Court before bringing the matter to the Federal Shariat Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the right of divorce (Talaq) can be delegated to the wife under Islamic law. 2- Whether the process outlined in Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, is consistent with Islamic injunctions. 3- Whether the terminology and procedural requirements in the ordinance are appropriate and in line with Shariah. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Delegation of Divorce (Talaq-e-Tafweez): The court held that the delegation of the right to pronounce Talaq to the wife (Talaq-e-Tafweez) is permissible under Islamic law. This delegation serves as a safeguard for women in cases where the husband is cruel, neglects his duties, or is absent for long periods. The court noted that this practice has been accepted by the majority of Sunni Muslim jurists and is recognized in Islamic jurisprudence. --Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961: The court acknowledged that the ordinance was enacted following the recommendations of a commission that recognized the legality of Talaq-e-Tafweez. The court found no contradiction between Section 8 and the injunctions of Islam, as the ordinance simply codifies a practice already accepted by Islamic jurists. --Jurisdictional Limitation: The court concluded that since the issue pertains to Muslim Personal Law\u2014a category exempt from the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court\u2014the petition was not maintainable. The court referred to a precedent that established the limitation of the court\u2019s jurisdiction in matters that are deeply rooted in the personal law of any Muslim sect. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 1994 SC 619: This case discussed the scope of the Federal Shariat Court\u2019s jurisdiction concerning Muslim Personal Law and was cited to justify the court's refusal to entertain the petition based on jurisdictional grounds.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the respondents, under Section 10(2) of the Offences of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. The appellant claimed that Mst. Masahiba Khan, who he alleged to be his legally wedded wife, had contracted a second marriage with Shahbaz Ahmed Khan, thereby committing the offense of Zina. ----Issues: 1- Whether the marriage between the appellant, Abdullah, and Mst. Masahiba Khan was valid and legally recognized. 2- Whether the marriage between the respondents, Shahbaz Ahmed Khan and Mst. Masahiba Khan, was lawful or constituted an act of Zina under the law. 3- Whether the trial court's acquittal of the respondents was justified given the circumstances and evidence presented. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Validity of Marriage Between Abdullah and Mst. Masahiba Khan: The court held that the marriage between Abdullah and Mst. Masahiba Khan was not legally recognized. The Family Court had already decreed in favor of Mst. Masahiba Khan in her suit for jactitation of marriage, declaring that no valid marriage existed between her and Abdullah. This decree was upheld by the District Judge and later by the Sindh High Court, thus nullifying any claims Abdullah had regarding the marriage. --Marriage Between Respondents: The court determined that the marriage between Shahbaz Ahmed Khan and Mst. Masahiba Khan was lawful. The acknowledgment of the marriage by both respondents during their statements before the trial court was considered sufficient evidence of a valid marriage under Muslim law. The court referenced the legal principle that acknowledgment by the man of the woman as his wife is sufficient proof of a valid marriage. The court found no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to acquit the respondents. Given the conclusive findings of the Family Court and the acknowledgment of marriage by the respondents, the court ruled that the acquittal was appropriate. The appeal was dismissed in limine. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants were convicted under Section 500 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to fines and imprisonment for defaming the complainant, who was their former husband (in the case of two appellants). The complainant alleged that the appellants had falsely accused him of zina (adultery) in legal proceedings and in applications submitted to higher authorities. The trial court acquitted some of the accused but convicted the appellants for defamation. The complainant appealed for their conviction under the Offence of Qazf (false accusation of adultery) and sought an enhancement of their sentences. ----Issues: 1- Whether the appellants\u2019 statements constituted defamation under Section 500 PPC. 2- Whether the appellants\u2019 actions amounted to Qazf under the Qazf (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. 3- Whether the trial court\u2019s conviction of the appellants under Section 500 PPC was legally justified. 4- Whether the appellants acted with malicious intent or in good faith. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Defamation (Section 500 PPC): The court found that the essential element of defamation is mens rea or intent to harm. It determined that the appellants acted in good faith to protect their rights rather than with the intent to harm the complainant's reputation. Therefore, their actions fell under the exceptions provided in Section 499 PPC, leading to the setting aside of their conviction under Section 500 PPC. --Qazf (Offence of False Accusation of Zina): The court concluded that the appellants did not commit Qazf, as their statements did not unambiguously accuse the complainant of zina. It emphasized that the required evidence for imposing Hadd punishment, such as a confession or the testimony of two witnesses fulfilling the requirement of Tazkiyah-al-Shahood, was not present. --Lack of Malicious Intent: The court found no evidence of malicious intent, recognizing that the appellants\u2019 actions were driven by a desire to assert their rights. Consequently, the trial court's conviction was not legally justified. --Acquittal of Other Accused and Dismissal of Appeals: The court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to acquit the other accused, finding no grounds for conviction. The appeals seeking enhancement of the appellants\u2019 sentences and the reversal of the acquittals of other accused were dismissed. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellant, a father, filed a criminal appeal against the acquittal of the respondents by the Additional Sessions Judge, Kabirwala, District Khanewal. The case revolves around the death of the appellant's daughter, who was found dead near a railway track under suspicious circumstances. Initially, the death was reported as a possible suicide after being run over by a train. The appellant, dissatisfied with the police investigation, filed a private complaint alleging that the respondents were responsible for the rape and murder of his daughter. ----Issues: 1- Whether the evidence presented by the appellant was sufficient to establish the guilt of the respondents beyond a reasonable doubt. 2- Whether the respondents were involved in the abduction, rape, and murder of the appellant's daughter. 3- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting the respondents of all charges. 4- Whether the circumstantial evidence provided by the prosecution was sufficient to overturn the acquittal. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Sufficiency of Evidence: The court held that the evidence provided by the appellant was largely circumstantial and failed to establish a direct connection between the respondents and the crime. The court noted inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's narrative, which led to doubts about the reliability of the evidence. --Abduction, Rape, and Murder Allegations: The court found that the prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, including the last-seen theory and extra-judicial confessions. The court emphasized that such evidence must be corroborated by strong, consistent facts, which were lacking in this case. The medical evidence also did not conclusively support the allegations of rape. --Trial Court\u2019s Decision: The appellate court agreed with the trial court's assessment that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reiterated that in criminal cases, the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused. --Circumstantial Evidence: The court held that while circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for conviction, it must form a complete chain that leads to only one conclusion: the guilt of the accused. In this case, the chain of evidence was broken, and the circumstances presented by the prosecution did not conclusively point to the respondents' guilt. As a result, the appeal was dismissed, and the respondents' acquittal was upheld. However, the court noted that the case against the absconding accused would be considered separately upon his arrest. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam v.

The petitioner argued that the provision, as well as the corresponding Column No. 18 of the Nikah Nama, was repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. He contended that this provision has led to misuse and misinterpretation, resulting in social and moral issues within society. The petitioner had previously exhausted other legal remedies, including a writ petition before the High Court and an appeal to the Supreme Court, both of which were dismissed. ----Issues: 1- Whether Section 8 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, is repugnant to the injunctions of Islam. 2- Whether a wife can exercise the right of divorce (Talaq-e-Tafweez) under Islamic law. 3- Whether the procedure for exercising Talaq-e-Tafweez as provided in Section 8 and Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, is in violation of Shariah. 4- Whether the matter falls under \"Muslim Personal Law,\" which is outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome The Federal Shariat Court dismissed the petition, holding that the issue of Talaq-e-Tafweez, and its permissibility, is a matter of Muslim Personal Law, which is outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Shariat Court as defined under Article 203B(c) of the Constitution of Pakistan. The court observed that various schools of Islamic thought have different interpretations regarding the validity and procedure of Talaq-e-Tafweez. The court also noted that the enactment of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, was based on recommendations from a commission formed to address marriage and family law issues. This ordinance provided for the delegation of the right of divorce by the husband to the wife, a practice accepted by most Muslim jurists, albeit with procedural differences. Given the differing views among Islamic jurists, the court concluded that the issue falls within the realm of \"Muslim Personal Law,\" which the court is barred from examining.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Amjad Ali and Fakhar Imam were convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge/Zilla Qazi, Buner at Daggar, for several offenses, including under Section 354-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Section 294 PPC, and Section 18 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. The convictions stemmed from an incident in which the appellants allegedly stripped two women, Mst. Nagina and Mst. Akhtar Meena, and recorded obscene videos of them, which were later distributed. The complainant, Kamil Khan, father of Mst. Nagina, reported that this act led to the murder of Mst. Nagina by her father-in-law due to the disgrace brought upon the family. -----Issues: 1- Whether the evidence supported the conviction of Amjad Ali under Section 354-A PPC, which pertains to stripping a woman and exposing her to public view. 2- Whether the appellants were rightly convicted for preparing or attempting to commit zina (adultery/fornication). 3- Whether the conviction under Section 294 PPC, which deals with obscene acts in public places, was justified. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Conviction under Section 354-A PPC: The court set aside the conviction of Amjad Ali under Section 354-A PPC. The court found that the essential elements required for this offense\u2014stripping the woman of her clothes and exposing her to public view\u2014were not proven by the prosecution. The evidence, including photographs, did not show that Mst. Nagina was stripped and exposed to the public. Therefore, the court concluded that the conviction under this section was not supported by the evidence. --Conviction under Section 18 of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979: The court altered the convictions of both appellants under Section 18 to convictions under Section 16 of the same Ordinance. Section 16 pertains to enticing or taking away a woman with criminal intent. The court found that while the evidence did not support a conviction for attempting to commit zina, it did support a conviction for taking the women with the intent to engage in illicit intercourse. The court sentenced the appellants to four years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 16, along with a fine, reducing the severity of their original sentences under Section 18. --Conviction under Section 294 PPC: The court maintained the conviction of both appellants under Section 294 PPC. The photographs provided evidence that the appellants were engaged in obscene acts in a place accessible to the public, thus justifying their conviction under this section. The court partially allowed the appeal by setting aside the conviction under Section 354-A PPC and altering the conviction under Section 18 to one under Section 16 of the Hudood Ordinance. The court maintained the conviction under Section 294 PPC, ensuring that the sentences would run concurrently and that the benefit of Section 382-B Cr.P.C. (consideration of time already spent in custody) would be extended to the appellants. -----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2005 Peshawar 128: The court referenced this case to define the term \"stripping\" and its implications under Section 354-A PPC.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner filed a criminal revision against the judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge, Mianwali, who closed further proceedings of a case under the law of Lian. The case originated from an FIR filed by the petitioner alleging that his wife, was abducted and committed zina (adultery) with other respondents. Following the arrest and trial of the accused, the respondents requested the court to conduct Lian proceedings due to a decree of dissolution of marriage that had been granted by the Family Court, which the petitioner did not appeal. -----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court correctly closed the criminal proceedings after conducting Lian proceedings. 2- Whether the petitioner's objections to the Lian proceedings were valid, considering the dissolution of marriage. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The criminal revision was dismissed, upholding the decision of the trial court to close further proceedings after conducting Lian. The marriage between the petitioner and Mst. Najma Bibi was dissolved by a Family Court decree, which was final as no appeal was filed by the petitioner. The court held that the proceedings of Lian were validly initiated and completed by the trial court. The petitioner had initially filed an FIR while the marriage was still intact, and he continued to allege zina in his written statements. The court noted that the petitioner actively participated in the Lian proceedings without objection. The court emphasized that, under Islamic law, the proceedings of Lian, once completed, bring the matter of zina to a close, with the truth of the oaths left to divine judgment. The petitioner\u2019s appeal was deemed a malicious attempt to prolong litigation, and the court found no merit in the objections raised. The court referenced precedent from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which supports the finality of dissolution decrees and the proper conduct of Lian proceedings. -----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Azam vs. Muhammad Iqbal (PLD 1984, SC 95) - The Supreme Court held that a Family Court decree, once final, cannot be challenged through collateral proceedings.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant was convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Mianwali, under Section 10(4) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, for zina-bil-jabr (rape) and sentenced to death. He was also convicted under Section 16 of the Ordinance for detaining a woman with criminal intent and sentenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment along with a fine. The case arose when the complainant, Rukan-ud-Din, accused Ishaq and his co-accused of abducting and raping his daughter-in-law as an act of revenge for a prior altercation. Muhammad Ishaq challenged his conviction and the sentence, while a murder reference was made for the confirmation of his death sentence. ----Issues: 1- Whether Muhammad Ishaq and his co-accused were guilty of zina-bil-jabr as per Section 10(4) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979. 2- Whether the appellant\u2019s actions amounted to the offense of detaining a woman with criminal intent under Section 16 or abduction under Section 11 of the Ordinance. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Zina-bil-jabr (Section 10(4)): The court found insufficient evidence to uphold the conviction under Section 10(4) of the Ordinance. While the victim testified against Ishaq, the lack of corroborative evidence, such as semen matching or independent witnesses, cast reasonable doubt. Additionally, the court considered it improbable in the social context of a tribal society for three real brothers to commit such an immoral act together, especially within their own house where family members were present. Therefore, the conviction for zina-bil-jabr was overturned, and the appellant was acquitted of this charge. Abduction (Section 11): The court found that the appellant had abducted the victim with the intent to commit illicit intercourse. The victim's testimony, combined with the evidence of injuries and the appellant's absconsion for a prolonged period, supported the conviction for abduction. The court converted the conviction under Section 16 (detaining a woman with criminal intent) to Section 11 (abduction with intent to force illicit intercourse) of the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, and imposed a life sentence along with a fine of Rs. 1,00,000. The conviction under Section 10(4) was set aside, and the appellant was acquitted of zina-bil-jabr. The conviction under Section 16 was converted to Section 11, and the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. The murder reference for the confirmation of the death sentence was answered in the negative and not confirmed. ----Citations/Precedents: 1992 SCMR 1625 PLD 1978 SC 1 2010 SCMR 625 PLD 2010 SC 47 PLJ 1997 FSC 77 2011 PSC 777 2010 SCMR 1025 PLD 1959 Dacca 956 (DB) PL 2007 Cr.C.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants were convicted under the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance VII of 1979. The case involved an allegation of abduction and zina by the complainant, who stated that his wife was taken by the appellants. The defense claimed that the complainant had divorced his wife, after which she married the second appellant (Muhammad Hussain). The trial court convicted both appellants, and they appealed the decision. ----Issues: 1- Whether the complainant had divorced Mst. Haleema Bibi. 2- Whether the marriage between Mst. Haleema and Muhammad Hussain was valid. 3- Whether the conviction under Section 10(2) of the Hudood Ordinance was justified without clear evidence of zina. 4- Whether the lack of documentary evidence of divorce and marriage invalidated the defense\u2019s claim. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court found that the prosecution failed to prove the case of abduction and zina beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense provided consistent testimony that the complainant had divorced Mst. Haleema and that she had lawfully married Muhammad Hussain. Witness testimony regarding the divorce was credible, and the fact that the appellants had children together further supported the defense's case. The trial court's reliance on the Family Court's dismissal of Mst. Haleema's suit for jactitation of marriage was found insufficient to prove that no divorce occurred. The court noted that even in the absence of documentary evidence of divorce or marriage, the consistent testimony of the appellants and witness DW1 was enough to create reasonable doubt. The court acquitted the appellants, holding that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof for zina, as required under Islamic law, including the need for four male eyewitnesses for zina cases. ----Citations/Precedents: PLJ 2007 Lahore 114 PLD 1984 Federal Shariat Court 93 PLD 1999 PSC 42 1997 P.Cr.L.J 1666 2005 P.Cr.L.J 219 PLD 1999 Lahore 479 1992 SCMR 1273 PLD 2000 Federal Shariat Court 63 2001 SCMR 56 2006 P.Cr.LJ 944 2010 PCrLJ 182 2008 YLR 293 2007 MLD 570 2004 YLR 1791 2004 CLC 984 1997 P.Cr.L.J 1312",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case involves an individual who was convicted by the trial court for committing rape on three occasions against their own daughter. The victim initially remained silent about the incidents to preserve the family's honor. However, after enduring repeated assaults, the victim finally reported the matter to the police. Medical examinations and DNA tests were conducted as part of the investigation, and the trial court sentenced the individual to death under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The conviction was challenged in appeal before the Federal Shariat Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the prosecution proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt. 2- Whether the defense\u2019s claim of an affair involving the victim was credible. 3- Whether the delay in reporting the crime affected the credibility of the case. 4- Whether the death sentence was appropriate given the circumstances. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Prosecution Evidence: The Federal Shariat Court upheld the trial court's conviction, finding that the prosecution had provided clear and convincing evidence, including the consistent testimony of the victim, corroborated by her mother, medical evidence, and forensic reports. --Defense's Argument: The court dismissed the defense\u2019s argument that the victim had an illicit relationship and concocted the story to cover it up. This claim was unsupported by any evidence and failed to create any doubt in the case. --Delay in FIR: The court accepted the explanation for the delay in reporting the incident, noting that the victim had initially remained silent to protect family honor. Given the sensitivity of the situation, the delay did not undermine the prosecution\u2019s case. --Sentencing: The court affirmed the death sentence, citing the grave nature of the offense. The crime of incestuous rape was deemed particularly heinous, as the individual had violated the trust of their own child, and such an offense deserved the maximum punishment under the law. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 1967 SC 498 2003 SCMR 698 2004 YLR 580 1997 SCMR 871",

Whether the petitioner could confront the respondent with a printout copy of an email during cross-examination. 2. Whether the email was admissible as additional evidence despite not being annexed or mentioned at the time of filing the application. 3. The applicability of Qanun-e-Shahadat and CPC in Family Court proceedings regarding the admissibility of digital documents, including WhatsApp communications. ---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petition was allowed. The impugned orders were set aside, permitting the petitioner to confront the respondent with digital documents during cross-examination. The court reasoned that although the Qanun-e-Shahadat and CPC do not strictly apply to Family Court proceedings, the basic principles of evidence should not be overlooked. It emphasized the importance of allowing cross-examination to test the veracity of the witness's statements and noted that digital communications, such as emails and WhatsApp messages, are increasingly prevalent and should be considered. The court clarified that emails and other forms of digital communication could be admitted as documentary evidence if their authenticity could be established. The court noted that digital documents, including emails and WhatsApp messages, could be referred to and used during cross-examination of a witness if it is established that these were genuinely authored by the witness. Furthermore, the court acknowledged that service of summons through WhatsApp is valid, highlighting the evolving nature of communication and its acceptance in legal procedures. This indicates that the courts are adapting to modern methods of communication for legal processes. Outcome: The petitioner was granted the right to confront the respondent with digital documents, including emails and WhatsApp messages. The Family Court was directed to assess the admissibility of these documents based on relevance and authenticity. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Ijaz Ahmed Chaudhri v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The appellant challenged the judgment dated 05.12.2022, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Kashmore, in Sessions Case No.144/2022. The case, originating from FIR No.05/2022, involved charges under Sections 302, 201, 311, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), registered at Police Station Gublo Katcho. The appellant was convicted under Section 201(1) PPC and sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000. ----Issues: 1- Whether the prosecution provided sufficient and reliable evidence to establish the appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 2- Whether the trial court erred in convicting the appellant despite significant contradictions and lack of evidence. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of five witnesses, including police officials. The prosecution claimed that the appellant, along with others, strangulated Mst. Azmat Khatoon to death and disposed of her body in the Indus River. The defense highlighted material contradictions in the prosecution's evidence, the absence of eyewitnesses, and the lack of any incriminating articles recovered from the appellant. The defense argued that the case was based on fabricated charges of honor killing. The High Court found several inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's case: The incident was not witnessed by the complainant or any other witnesses. None of the deceased's family members or close associates filed the complaint. There was no recovery of the deceased's body or the alleged motorbike loader used in the crime. The investigation officer failed to gather statements from neighbors or co-villagers who could corroborate the prosecution's story. The recovery of the deceased's Dupatta was not subjected to DNA testing, nor was this piece of evidence confronted with the appellant during his statement. Conclusion: The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the appellant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The inconsistencies and lack of reliable evidence rendered the prosecution's case highly doubtful. The conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court were set aside, and the appellant was acquitted and released. ----Citations/Precedents: Ayub Masih v. State (PLD 2002 SC 1048): Emphasized the principle that the judicial system should err on the side of acquitting a guilty person rather than convicting an innocent one. Naveed Asghar and 2 others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Sentence reduction---Background: The appellant was found in possession of 6 K.Gs of Charas and, after due trial, was convicted under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. He was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 8 years with a fine of twelve thousand rupees, and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for six months and fifteen days. The appellant was given the benefit of Section 382-B of the Criminal Procedure Code. The judgment was delivered by the 3rd Additional Sessions Judge (MCTC)/Special Judge for CNS, Larkana, on 18.05.2021. The appellant challenged this judgment by filing a criminal jail appeal. ----Issues: Whether the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant should be reduced considering his circumstances. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The appellant's counsel stated that he would not press the appeal on merits if the conviction and sentence were reduced to the period already undergone. This proposition was conceded by the Additional Prosecutor General for the State. Upon hearing the arguments and reviewing the record, the court found that the appellant was in possession of 6 K.Gs of Charas, as proven by the testimonies of ASI Ayaz Hussain, Mashir Niaz Ali, and Investigation Officer SIP Khadim Hussain, along with a positive report from the Chemical Examiner. The trial court rightly established the appellant's guilt beyond a shadow of doubt. However, considering the appellant's age (32 years), lack of previous criminal record, and his role as the sole breadwinner for his family, the court decided to modify the sentence. The appellant showed genuine repentance by not pressing the appeal on merits and had already undergone 2 years and 6 days of the substantive sentence, with an additional remission of 4 years, 1 month, and 15 days. The court modified the conviction and sentence to the period already undergone, including imprisonment for the failure to pay the fine. The criminal jail appeal was disposed of with the modification that the appellant's conviction and sentence were reduced to the period already undergone, taking into account the time served and the remission earned.",

In default of payment, he would serve an additional six months of simple imprisonment. The case stemmed from an FIR lodged by the complainant Muhammad Ali on 07.05.2016, following the murder of his father, Zamir Ahmed Veesar. The appellant was accused of shooting the deceased after a dispute over a minor issue involving children. -----Issues: 1- Whether the evidence presented by the prosecution was credible and sufficient to support the conviction. 2- Whether the trial court properly evaluated the testimonies of the witnesses and the medical evidence. 3- Whether the appellant was falsely implicated due to a family dispute. 4- Whether there were material contradictions in the prosecution's evidence that warranted the appellant's acquittal. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome The court, after careful examination of the arguments and evidence, upheld the conviction and sentence. The following points were crucial in the decision: ---Eyewitness Testimonies: The prosecution presented three eyewitnesses, including the complainant Muhammad Ali and two other relatives, who all testified consistently about the events leading to the murder. They stated that the appellant, who is the real brother of the deceased, shot Zamir Ahmed in a fit of rage following a verbal altercation. The court found their testimonies credible and natural as they were present at the scene of the crime. ---Medical Evidence: The medical officer's testimony confirmed that the deceased suffered multiple gunshot wounds, which matched the account provided by the eyewitnesses. The injuries were consistent with the cause of death being due to excessive hemorrhage and damage to vital organs. ---Investigation and Forensic Evidence: The investigating officer and other supporting witnesses provided detailed accounts of the investigation process, including the recovery of the murder weapon and empty cartridges from the crime scene. The forensic analysis linked the recovered weapon to the crime, further corroborating the eyewitness accounts. --Defense's Argument and Court's Rejection: The defense argued that there were material contradictions in the witnesses' testimonies and that they were interested parties with a motive to falsely implicate the appellant. However, the court found these contradictions to be minor and not significant enough to undermine the overall credibility of the prosecution's case. The court also noted that the relationship of the witnesses to the deceased did not automatically discredit their testimonies, especially when their accounts were consistent and supported by other evidence.The court found no merit in the arguments presented by the defense and upheld the trial court's judgment based on substantial and corroborated evidence. ------Citations/Precedents: Abdul Jabbar alias Jabbari v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Syed Asif Hussain Shah filed a writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, challenging the vires of an order dated December 19, 2023. The order was issued by the learned Judge Family Court, Rawalpindi, which decreed the suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of khula, initiated by respondent No. 4, upon failure of reconciliation proceedings. The petitioner also questioned the constitutionality of the proviso to Sub-Sections 4 & 5 of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, arguing that they contravene Articles 4, 8, 9, and 10-A of the Constitution. The marriage between the petitioner and respondent No. 4 took place on February 14, 2002, and the spouses had three children. Due to differences, the respondent sought dissolution of marriage through khula. ----Issues: 1. Whether the Family Court conducted reconciliation proceedings in an effective manner before passing the decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of khula. 2. Whether the proviso to Sub-Sections 4 & 5 of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, is contrary to Articles 4, 8, 9, and 10-A of the Constitution. 3. Whether it was obligatory for the Family Court to seek the consent and willingness of the husband before passing the decree for khula. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the Family Court is mandated to ascertain the precise points of controversy between the parties and attempt to effect a compromise at the pre-trial stage. If reconciliation fails, the Family Court is required to immediately pass a decree for dissolution of marriage through khula and may direct the wife to surrender a portion of her dower. The court emphasized that Islamic injunctions permit the dissolution of marriage through khula without the necessity of proving any fault of the husband. The case references highlighted the distinction between dissolution of marriage through khula and other forms such as talaq and mubarat. The court noted that khula can be granted without the husband's consent if reconciliation fails. Consequently, the petition challenging the Family Court's decree was dismissed, and the court upheld the constitutionality of the proviso to Sub-Sections 4 & 5 of Section 10 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. ----Citations/Precedents: SALEEM AHMAD and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted ---- In the Lahore High Court, Lahore, Muhammad Arshad, Mudassar, and Maqsood Ahmad appealed their convictions and sentences handed down by the Additional Sessions Judge, Depalpur. They, along with co-accused Muhammad Din, Akram, and Haq Nawaz, were charged under sections 302, 364, 109, 148, and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in a private complaint filed by Muhammad Hussain related to FIR No.279 of 2014. The trial court convicted the appellants and acquitted the co-accused. The appellants challenged their convictions through jail authorities. ----Issues: 1. Whether the abduction and subsequent murder of Muhammad Amjad by the appellants were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2. Whether the discrepancies in the prosecution's evidence and the delay in reporting the crime affect the credibility of the prosecution's case. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court found significant discrepancies in the prosecution's evidence, particularly regarding the complainant's presence during the abduction and the delay in reporting the incident to the police. The court noted that the initial information about the abduction lacked credibility as the complainant did not witness the incident and did not report it to the police immediately. Additionally, the court found inconsistencies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses and the medical evidence, which contradicted the ocular account. The court also observed that the motive for the crime, as stated by the complainant, did not align with the conduct of the accused, as they allegedly targeted Muhammad Amjad instead of the complainant or other witnesses, despite having enmity with the complainant's family. Furthermore, the delay in conducting the post-mortem examination and the submission of police papers suggested possible fabrication of evidence. Given these discrepancies and the lack of reliable evidence, the court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In this Writ Petition No. 29490 of 2022 before the Lahore High Court, the petitioner, Mst. Nimra Sheikh, challenged an order dated 18.02.2022 by the Family Court, Lahore. The Family Court had dismissed her objections regarding the maintainability of a suit for recovery of bridal gifts filed by the respondent. Issues: 1. Whether bridal gifts given to the bride at the time of marriage, as defined under the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976, can be subject to recovery by the giver (husband or his parents) post-marriage. 2. Whether the Family Court erred in not dismissing the suit at the preliminary stage despite clear legal provisions vesting such gifts in the bride absolutely. ----Holding/Reasoning: The Lahore High Court held that the bridal gifts and other articles given to the bride at the time of marriage vest absolutely in the bride, as per Section 5 of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976. The Court observed that the Family Court should have recognized the statutory rights of the petitioner over these gifts, which are meant to remain her property irrespective of the marital circumstances. The High Court emphasized that the law is clear on the point that such property vests unconditionally and absolutely in the bride, dismissing the need for further adjudication on any disputed proposition of law or fact regarding the ownership and recovery of bridal gifts. ----Outcome: The Lahore High Court allowed the petition, rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent in the Family Court, thereby terminating the suit seeking recovery of the bridal gifts. The Court also imposed costs on the respondent for filing a meritless suit that was vexatious in nature. ----Citations/Precedents: Section 2(a) and 2(e) of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976: Defines bridal gifts and present. Section 5 of the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976: Stipulates that all property given as dowry or bridal gifts shall vest absolutely in the bride.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted. --- This case involves an appeal in the Lahore High Court against convictions under sections 302, 460, and 411 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The appellants were convicted for the deaths of two individuals, found under suspicious circumstances in their residence. The initial report was lodged by a family member who discovered the victims after failing to make contact and became suspicious of foul play. The trial court convicted the appellants based on circumstantial evidence including DNA and fingerprint matches. -----Issues: 1. Whether the circumstantial evidence, including forensic evidence, was sufficient to uphold the convictions. 2. Whether procedural lapses in handling forensic evidence compromised its reliability and the integrity of the judicial process. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Lahore High Court overturned the convictions and acquitted the appellants, identifying critical procedural errors and the insufficient linking of the appellants to the crime through the evidence provided. Key issues highlighted included: The improper handling and preservation of forensic evidence which cast doubts on its authenticity and reliability. The unreliability of witness testimonies and the failure of the prosecution to establish an unbroken chain of circumstantial evidence directly implicating the appellants. The lack of direct evidence and inconsistencies in the procedural conduct of the investigation and subsequent forensic analysis. The court emphasized the necessity of strict adherence to procedural norms in the collection and analysis of forensic evidence in criminal cases. ----Citations/Precedents: Gul Muhammad and others v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, filed a writ petition challenging the order dated March 27, 2014, passed by Judge Family Court-West, Islamabad. This order dismissed the petitioner\u2019s objection to the maintainability of a family suit filed by respondent No.2, who claimed to be his wife and sought dissolution of marriage. The petitioner denied the existence of a marriage contract and argued that the suit did not fall within the Family Court's jurisdiction. -----Issues: Whether the Family Court has jurisdiction to decide a case where the existence of the matrimonial relationship is denied. Whether the appropriate forum for resolving disputes about the matrimonial status is the Civil Court or the Family Court. The impact of an existing marriage of the respondent with another individual on the jurisdiction and proceedings of the Family Court. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Islamabad High Court dismissed the petition in limine, upholding the Family Court's jurisdiction to decide the case. The Court provided the following reasoning: Section 5 of the Family Court Act, 1964 grants exclusive jurisdiction to Family Courts to entertain and adjudicate matters specified in Part I of the Schedule, which includes jactitation of marriage. Jactitation of marriage, where one spouse denies the existence of a marriage, falls within the exclusive domain of the Family Court. Abdul Waheed vs. Asma Jehangir [PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219]: The Supreme Court held that the validity of a marriage is within the exclusive domain of the Family Court, and High Courts should avoid creating controversies on this subject. Abdul Hamid vs. Munaza Fakhar [2006 YLR 2622 Lahore]: It was established that disputes about the existence of marital relations between spouses fall under the Family Court's jurisdiction, while similar disputes raised by third parties fall under Civil Court jurisdiction. The petitioner cited cases involving inheritance disputes and third-party challenges to marital status. These precedents were distinguished as they did not pertain to direct disputes between spouses. The Court concluded that the Family Court correctly assumed jurisdiction over the matter as it involved a direct dispute between alleged spouses regarding the existence of their marriage. Consequently, the petition challenging the Family Court's order was dismissed. -----Citations/Precedents: MST Jameela Akhtar vs. Public at Large [2002 SCMR 1544] Abdul Waheed vs. Asma Jehangir [PLD 2004 Supreme Court 219] Abdul Hamid vs. Munaza Fakhar [2006 YLR 2622 Lahore] Unreported Supreme Court Judgment in Mst.

After Respondent No. 2 contracted a second marriage, Nosheen Agha filed for maintenance for herself and her daughter. The Family Judge initially set interim maintenance at Rs. 15,000 per month, but Respondent No. 2 failed to pay. Consequently, the Family Court struck off Respondent No. 2\u2019s defense and decreed maintenance at Rs. 1,50,000 per month from August 2011. Respondent No. 2 appealed, resulting in the reduction of maintenance to Rs. 15,000 per month with a 15% annual increase. -----Issues: Whether the appellate court erred in reducing the quantum of maintenance without proper reasoning and consideration of statutory provisions. Whether the trial court\u2019s decision to strike off Respondent No. 2\u2019s defense and decree the suit was justified based on the respondent\u2019s failure to pay interim maintenance. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Islamabad High Court set aside the appellate judgment and restored the trial court's decision to strike off Respondent No. 2's defense. The case was remanded to the trial court to reassess the quantum of maintenance after evaluating the financial status of Respondent No. 2. The court found that both the trial and appellate courts failed to properly assess the financial status of Respondent No. 2 and the needs of the minor child. It emphasized that decreeing a suit requires judicial determination based on evidence and law. The appellate court\u2019s reduction of maintenance was deemed unwarranted as it did not consider these factors. The appellate judgment was set aside, and the case was remanded to the trial court for reassessment. The trial court was directed to resolve the matter within one month, with each party bearing their own costs. -----Citations/Precedents: Messrs A.R.

Following family disputes, both parties approached the Family Court. The wife filed a suit for dissolution of marriage, recovery of dowry articles, maintenance allowance, and custody of the minor. The Family Court framed five issues and, after evidence and arguments, delivered a judgment on July 23, 2008. ----Issues: Whether the petitioner was denied the right of cross-examination. Whether the petitioner is entitled to custody of the minor given the minor's age. Whether the maintenance allowance should be reduced or adjusted. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petitioner's claim about the denial of cross-examination rights was dismissed based on a previous court decision on June 18, 2008, which ruled that allowing every Family Court order to be challenged via writ petition would abuse constitutional jurisdiction. The court emphasized the minor's welfare and the petitioner\u2019s remarriage, deciding it was not in the minor's best interest to be under the care of a stepmother, while the father is often absent due to work. The father's conduct and insufficient maintenance provision disqualified him from custody. The court affirmed the maintenance allowance adjustment to Rs. 2,000 per month as reasonable given the circumstances. The petition was dismissed for lack of merit, with no costs imposed. ----Citations/Precedents: 2007 SCMR 621 1994 CLC 1216 Lahore 1994 CLC 1242 Karachi PLD 1988 Karachi 252 PLD 1988 Karachi 261 1995 CLC 800 Lahore 1995 CLC 813 Lahore 1991 MLD 745 Lahore 1991 MLD 756 Lahore 2000 SCMR 838",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petitioner sought a declaration against the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and Additional District Judge, Islamabad, which were deemed illegal and without lawful authority. The petitioner, married on January 20, 1995, claimed dowry articles, gold ornaments (19 tolas), possession of a house, and maintenance allowance as stipulated in the Nikahnama. The Family Court partially decreed the suit, and the petitioner appealed, which was dismissed. ----Issues: Whether the solitary statement of the wife is sufficient to prove the claim for dowry articles. Whether the petitioner is required to prove the claim for dowry articles in terms of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Whether the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and Additional District Judge were lawful and based on a proper appreciation of the evidence. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the solitary statement of the wife is sufficient to prove the claim for dowry articles. This stance is supported by previous judgments which affirm that the wife\u2019s testimony alone can substantiate such claims. The requirement for proof in terms of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, was deemed inapplicable in this case due to Section 17(1) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which excludes the application of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order in Family Court proceedings. The court noted that it is impractical and against societal norms for brides to keep purchase receipts or to prepare and have a dowry list signed by the husband's side. The cultural context and traditions support the acceptance of the wife\u2019s testimony regarding dowry articles. Consequently, the constitutional petition was allowed. The judgments of the Family Court and Additional District Judge were set aside, and the petitioner was awarded Rs.150,000 as the value of dowry articles, accounting for depreciation. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Jaffar v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant, challenged the judgment and decree dated November 30, 2018, passed by the Civil Judge, Islamabad. The suit sought a declaration, permanent, and mandatory injunction regarding inheritance rights in House No.D-117, Pakistan Navy Housing Scheme \u2013 Haider, Zamzama, Karachi. The appellant claimed that he and his family were entitled to shares in the inheritance of the suit property from his deceased son, Lt. Abdul Qayyum, who passed away on December 29, 1997. The appellant also contested a letter dated August 2, 1999, from the Director General, Welfare and Rehabilitation, Naval Headquarters, which transferred the suit property solely to his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Ayesha Qayyum (respondent No.5). ----Issues: 1- Inheritance Rights: Whether the suit property was part of Lt. 2- Abdul Qayyum's estate to be inherited by all his legal heirs. 3- Validity of Allotment: Whether the transfer of the suit property to respondent No.5, as per Navy Housing Scheme\u2019s terms, was lawful. 4- Legality of Marriage: Whether the appellant's claim that the nikahnama was forged had any merit. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: ---Inheritance Rights: The Court held that Lt. Abdul Qayyum was a member of the Navy Housing Scheme and was entitled to the allotment of a house only upon retirement, provided he completed 23 years of commissioned service. Clause 19 of the scheme\u2019s terms stipulated that in the event of a member's death during membership, the house would be transferred to the widow or next-of-kin. Thus, the suit property was transferred to respondent No.5 based on this clause. ---Validity of Allotment: The Court found that the ownership of the suit property did not vest in Lt. Abdul Qayyum at any material stage; he only had membership in the housing scheme. Since the property was transferred to respondent No.5 (widow of Lt. Abdul Qayyum) as per the terms of the housing scheme, it did not form part of Lt. Abdul Qayyum's legacy/estate. The Court upheld that the allotment was valid and lawful as per the contractual terms of the Navy Housing Scheme. ---Legality of Marriage: The Court noted that the appellant had acknowledged respondent No.5 as the widow of Lt. Abdul Qayyum in a letter dated September 9, 1998, and a succession certificate issued by the High Court of Sindh recognized respondent No.5 as the widow. The Court found no merit in the appellant's claim of forgery of the nikahnama. -----Citations/Precedents Shahnaz Parveen v. Javed Yaqoob (2020 MLD 638): Held that property acquired posthumously by nomination does not constitute inheritance. Wafaqi Hakoomat-e-Pakistan v. Awamunnas (PLD 1991 SC 731): Distinguished between property owned by the deceased and property not owned at the time of death. Zaheer Abbas v. Pir Asif (2011 CLC 1528): Clarified that service benefits accruing posthumously do not form part of the deceased\u2019s estate.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Javed Islam (petitioner) and Tahir Islam (respondent) are brothers who jointly purchased property and engaged in joint businesses, including Javed Goods Transport Company and New Sialkot Karachi Goods Forwarding Company. In 2012, the respondent convinced the petitioner to enter into a family settlement where the respondent would surrender his interest in the jointly owned property in exchange for the petitioner relinquishing his share in the business. Despite acting on this settlement, the respondent filed a suit for partition of the property in 2016. ----Issues: Whether the disputed property is jointly owned by the parties based on the sale deeds. Whether the respondent is entitled to partition and separate possession of the property. Whether the respondent had surrendered his interest in the property based on the family settlement. Whether the suit for partition is barred by law. Whether the respondent has a cause of action for filing the suit. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Non-framing of Consolidated Issues: The court observed that after consolidating the suits filed by both parties, the trial court failed to frame consolidated issues considering the pleadings of both parties. Proper issues reflecting the real controversy were not framed, which is essential for an accurate and efficient trial. The court highlighted the importance of framing issues correctly to narrow down the area of conflict and ensure that parties lead evidence based on these issues. Importance of Correct Issues: The court emphasized that issues in a civil suit determine the material points of fact or law in dispute. Accurate framing of issues is crucial as it guides the evidence and arguments, ensuring that the court's decision is based on a clear understanding of the real dispute. The trial court's failure to frame proper issues after consolidation resulted in proceedings that did not address the actual controversy. Legal Precedents: The court referred to several legal precedents, including Muhammad Yousaf and others v. Haji Murad Muhammad and others (PLD 2003 SC 184) and Mst. Rasheeda Bibi & others v. Mukhtar Ahmad & others (PLJ 2010 SC 530), which emphasize the necessity of framing issues in accordance with the pleadings to ensure a fair trial. ---Conclusion: Without touching the merits of the case, the court set aside the judgments and decrees of the lower courts. The case was remanded to the trial court with directions to re-frame consolidated issues based on the pleadings, record evidence, and decide the case afresh on merits. The trial court is instructed to expedite the proceedings and decide the case preferably within six months from the date of receipt of the certified copy of this judgment.",

Saidan Bibi. They contended that Saidan Bibi was the daughter of Fateh Muhammad, who owned 61-Kanals 02-Marlas of land in Chak No.385/GB, Tehsil Samundari, District Faisalabad. The petitioners argued that the respondents conspired to exclude Saidan Bibi from the inheritance mutation (Mutation No.35 dated 11.08.1961) and sought their shares in the suit land. The suit was contested by the respondents, primarily Safdar Ali, who argued that the petitioners were not entitled to any share as the relevant laws at the time did not recognize the rights of maternal grandchildren. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the petitioners' appeal was also dismissed, leading to the current revision petition. ---Issues: Effect of Withdrawal of Previous Suit: Whether the petitioners were precluded from filing the current suit due to the withdrawal of a previous suit without permission to refile. Limitation: Whether the suit was barred by limitation. Credibility of Evidence: Whether the evidence presented by the petitioners was credible enough to support their claim. ---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: ---Effect of Withdrawal of Previous Suit: The court held that the petitioners' previous suit, which was withdrawn without seeking permission to file afresh, barred them from instituting the current suit under Order XXIII, Rule 1(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. This rule precludes the plaintiff from instituting any fresh suit on the same cause of action if the withdrawal is without permission. The court relied on the Supreme Court judgment in Muhammad Yar (Deceased) through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Amin (Deceased) through L.Rs. (2013 SCMR 464), which emphasized that withdrawal of a suit without permission to refile precludes the institution of a fresh suit on the same subject matter. ---Limitation: The court found that the suit was barred by limitation. The previous suit was withdrawn on 02.10.2002, and the current suit was filed approximately eight years later. Under Order XXIII, Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, the petitioners were bound by the law of limitation as if the first suit had not been instituted. The court noted that once the limitation period begins, it does not stop unless there is a valid reason, which was not present in this case. ---Credibility of Evidence: The court found the documentary evidence presented by the petitioners regarding the death of Mst. Saidan Bibi and Fateh Muhammad to be unreliable. The Secretary Union Council's report indicated no entries of their deaths in the relevant registers for the years claimed by the petitioners. The respondents' documents (Ex.D1 and Ex.D2), being public documents, were found to be credible and supported the respondents' stance. The court concluded that Mst. Saidan Bibi, having died before Fateh Muhammad, was rightly excluded from the inheritance mutation, as the Muslim Family Personal Law Ordinance, 1961, which could have granted the petitioners rights, was not enacted at the time of her death. ---Conclusion: The court concluded that the petitioners failed to prove their case by leading credible and convincing evidence. The concurrent findings of the lower courts, which were based on proper appreciation and evaluation of the evidence, were upheld. The revision petition was dismissed. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Yar (Deceased) through L.Rs. v. Muhammad Amin (Deceased) through L.Rs. (2013 SCMR 464) Khawaja Bashir Ahmed and Sons (Pvt.)

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Tariq Mehmood (appellant) filed a suit for recovery of damages amounting to Rs. 58,250,000 against Tahir Farooq (respondent) on grounds of malicious prosecution. The suit was dismissed by the Civil Judge 1st Class, Lahore, on 29.10.2022. Tariq Mehmood appealed this decision. The case stemmed from an incident on 21.06.2003, where the respondent allegedly attacked the appellant and falsely implicated him in a criminal case resulting in a prolonged trial. The appellant claimed damages for mental torture, financial loss, and reputational damage. ----Issues: Whether the appellant was entitled to recovery of damages for malicious prosecution. Whether the suit was maintainable in its present form. Whether the appellant had concealed true facts or filed the suit to harass and blackmail the respondent. Whether the appellant had a cause of action or locus standi to file the suit. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Entitlement to Damages for Malicious Prosecution: The trial court found that the appellant was acquitted based on the benefit of the doubt, not on merits, and thus failed to prove the prosecution was malicious. The essential elements to establish malicious prosecution include: prosecution by the defendant, lack of reasonable and probable cause, malice, the prosecution ending in the plaintiff's favor, and damage to the plaintiff. The appellant failed to establish the absence of reasonable and probable cause and malice. ----Maintanability of the Suit: The trial court considered the suit maintainable but found that the appellant did not meet the burden of proof to establish malicious prosecution. ---Concealment of Facts or Harassment: The trial court did not find sufficient evidence to support that the appellant concealed facts or filed the suit to harass the respondent. The focus remained on whether the malicious prosecution claim was substantiated. Cause of Action or Locus Standi: The appellant had the locus standi to file the suit, but the claim for damages required proof of all elements of malicious prosecution, which the appellant failed to provide. ---Detailed Reasoning: The term \u201cmalice\u201d implies an improper motive and not just the absence of reasonable and probable cause. Malice can be inferred from circumstantial evidence. The appellant relied on self-defense under Section 78 of the PPC, claiming he was present at the respondent\u2019s residence under a Family Court order. However, the respondent\u2019s attack and the resulting injuries were established as reasonable and probable cause for prosecution. The trial court noted that mere absence of reasonable and probable cause is not sufficient to prove malice. Malice must be proved alongside the absence of reasonable and probable cause. The appellant\u2019s acquittal on benefit of the doubt indicated that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was weak but did not conclusively prove the prosecution was malicious. An acquittal by benefit of the doubt does not automatically entitle the acquitted person to damages for malicious prosecution. The trial court correctly applied the principles and legal precedents, including the requirements set out in cases like \u201cNiaz and others v. Abdul Sattar and others\u201d and \u201cMuhammad Yousaf v. Abdul Qayyum.\u201d ----Citations/Precedents: Niaz and others v. Abdul Sattar and others (PLD 2006 Supreme Court 432) Muhammad Yousaf v. Abdul Qayyum (PLD 2016 SC 478) Sadaruz Zaman v. The State (1990 SCMR 1277) Feroze Khan v. Fateh Khan and 2 others (1991 SCMR 2220) Outcome: The appeal was dismissed, upholding the trial court's judgment. The appellant failed to prove the elements required for a claim of malicious prosecution, particularly the absence of reasonable and probable cause and malice. Consequently, the claim for damages was denied. ---''The appellant's suit for recovery of damages on account of malicious prosecution was dismissed on the ground that the appellant was acquitted from the criminal cases on the basis of benefit of doubt. This Court has upheld the said judgment while holding that no doubt it is true that the acquittal of a person in a criminal case sometimes gives presumption that there was no reasonable cause for his prosecution, but this presumption is rebuttable and there cannot be any universally accepted phenomenon that in case the criminal prosecution fails, then the accused would be automatically entitled for recovery of damages as otherwise in all those cases where the prosecution fails, it would give rise to damages in favour of an accused. Therefore, the nature of acquittal has to be kept in view as well.''",

Mandatory Requirement of S. 544-A Cr.PC: What are the implications and mandatory requirements under Section 544-A Cr.PC regarding compensation to the heirs of the deceased? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Circumstantial Evidence and Confessional Statements: The court held that circumstantial evidence must be compelling and lead to a single conclusion of guilt. Confessional statements, if made voluntarily and corroborated by other evidence, hold significant evidentiary value. \"Last Seen\" Theory: The court found the \"last seen\" evidence admissible, noting that if the accused was last seen with the deceased and could not satisfactorily explain their whereabouts thereafter, it strongly suggested involvement in the crime. Retracted Judicial Confession: The court confirmed that a retracted judicial confession could form the basis of a conviction if it is shown to be made voluntarily and is corroborated by strong, independent evidence.

The trial court consolidated all the suits and allowed an expert opinion regarding thumbprint identification on a disputed document. The trial court dismissed Gul Bad Shah's suit and decreed the appellants' suits. The respondents appealed, and the appellate court focused on the evidentiary value of the expert opinion, concluding that it was not conclusive evidence. The petitioner in this document argues that both parties had agreed to consider the expert opinion as binding, creating a procedural agreement. The petitioner refers to the principle of estoppel and argues that Gul Bad Shah cannot change his position after the expert report confirmed his thumbprint. The petitioner contends that the appellate court failed to appreciate this aspect and sets aside the appellate judgment, restoring the trial court's judgment and decree.",

They were sentenced to life imprisonment and also fined Rs. 200,000 each, with a default sentence of two years' imprisonment in case of non-payment of the fine. According to the (FIR) registered by the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF), the appellants were stopped and checked at a picket near Motorway Tool Plaza Peshawar. The ANF officials found narcotics in their vehicle and arrested them. The prosecution produced evidence, including samples of the recovered contraband and reports from the Chemical Examiner, to support its case. During the trial, the appellants claimed that they were innocent and had come to Peshawar for a family event. They argued that they had no knowledge of the narcotics found in the vehicle. However, the court found the prosecution's evidence to be overwhelming and sufficient to prove the appellants' guilt. The court upheld the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment imposed on the appellants. The appeal was dismissed.",

Therefore, the objection raised by the respondents in their comments that petitioners are retained against a monthly retainer fee holds no water. Petitioners by all intents and purposes are contract employees of the project which is sustained from 2007 with no end in the future particularly after the 25th Constitutional Amendment, there is need to do much more to resolve the socio-economic problems in the erstwhile FATA.Criteria for appointment, responsibilities, objectives and SOPs of the male mobilizer or social mobilizer are defined in Clause 6.3.15 of the PC-1 of the Population Welfare Programme FATA (2010-15), according to which the social mobilizers play a pivotal role in enlighten adoption of family planning, responsible parenthood and mother & child healthcare. According to sub-Para-c, the Male Mobilizer has been re-designated as Social Mobilizer, Para-d denotes that the social mobilizer will be recruited on contract basis with fixed emoluments with fixed yearly increment. Thus, it has become crystal clear that the appointment of male/social mobilizer is on contract basis. Since petitioners have been serving for the last twelve years, it means the male mobilizers are eternal need of the department and now the merger of erstwhile FATA, has increased their importance. Their services have been matured and as such, they have earned entitlement for regularization of their services. Regularization of employees does not require any statutory rules rather the same depends on the length of their service, therefore, they are fully entitled to be regularized.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The bare reading of this section shows that the learned Judge Family Court is restrained by law not to allow additional evidence or add names of witnesses in the schedule. The provisions are mandatory. The schedule cannot be amended and the names of witnesses cannot be added under section 7(2) of the Family Courts Act. The provisions of this section empowers the learned judge family Court that parties with the permission of the Court call any witness at any later stage if court considers such evidence expedient in the inters of justice. This does not mean that the family court will re-open the schedule and allow the parties to produce additional witnesses as there is no provision to allow a family court or appellate court to re-open schedule submitted by the parties.Usually, in family cases, the husband for the satisfaction of his ego try to linger-on the family case in order to drag the wife in a protracted litigation so that she cannot live peacefully in this male dominant society. Petitioner remained silent during the trial of case despite ample opportunity to produce everything and every witness in his defence, and at appellate stage he filed application for additional evidence. Though the Family Courts Act, 1964, does not allow such addition of witnesses, even otherwise, the civil law too discourage such a practise.Defendant in his written statement has admitted the dowry articles but alleged that the same were taken back by plaintiff herself; but there is no evidence to support the version of petitioner as to taking back the dowry articles. There is a concurrent finding of fact qua dowry articles and value of same mentioned in the list Ex.P.W.1/1 of the two courts and hence, it could not be interfered with.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Necessary ingredients of offence u/s 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 were not disclosed through the complaint. ---- BackgroundMuhammad Bilal filed a criminal appeal against the order dated 13.11.2017 by the Additional Sessions Judge-V, Dera Ismail Khan, which dismissed his complaint under Sections 3/4 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005. The complaint arose from allegations that Ahmad Sultan and others had illegally encroached upon land owned and previously possessed by Bilal and his family in Dera Ismail Khan. Despite multiple reports to police authorities, no actions were taken against the respondents, leading Bilal to file the now-dismissed complaint.----Issues:Whether the dismissal of the complaint under Sections 3/4 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 was appropriate, given the alleged lack of opportunity for Bilal to prove his case through evidence.Whether the matter constitutes a criminal offense under the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 or merely a civil dispute.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Peshawar High Court upheld the dismissal of Bilal's complaint, finding that the complaint and accompanying documents did not disclose the necessary ingredients of an offense under Section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005. The court noted that the actions described in the complaint amounted to mere encroachment without the intent (mens rea) required for an offense under the act. It was concluded that the issue at hand was of a civil nature rather than criminal dispossession. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, but Bilal was given the liberty to pursue his claims in a civil court.---Ingrediants: 1. Intentional Dispossession: The accused must have intentionally entered or remained on the property with the intent to dispossess the rightful owner.----2. Unlawful Entry: The entry onto the property must be without lawful authority, not merely a civil encroachment or boundary dispute.----3.Mens Rea (Criminal Intent): There must be clear evidence of a criminal intent to deprive the rightful owner of possession, not just incidental or accidental occupation.----4. Dispossession or Attempted Dispossession: There must be an actual dispossession or a clear attempt to dispossess the lawful owner of the property.---Citations/Precedents:Wagar Ali and others vs. The State through Prosecutor/AG (PLD 2011 SC 181): The Supreme Court of Pakistan highlighted the distinction between illegal dispossession involving intentional property grabbing and mere encroachment, which typically indicates a civil dispute rather than a criminal offense under the Illegal Dispossession Act.---Direct Quote: ''The above allegation clearly indicates that it is an encroachment rather than criminal trespass or unlawful entry with the intention of grabbing the land in dispute or of dispossession of the appellant/complainant. Mere encroachment is something different from Illegal Dispossession as the former does not involve intentional grabbing of the property, therefore, the element of mens rea is missing in the instant case; therefore, I found that necessary ingredient of offence under Section 3 of the Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 were not disclosed through the complaint, therefore, it was rightly dismissed by the learned trial Court.''",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioners, sought the jurisdiction of the court to entertain their plea concerning the custody of two minor daughters, who were born in Karachi and were residing there. The petitioners claimed that the Family Court in Peshawar had no jurisdiction to entertain the case related to the custody of minors permanently residing in Karachi. The Family Court had assumed cognizance of the case and passed orders for interim custody in favor of the respondent, which the petitioners contended were illegal and beyond the court's lawful authority. They contended that the court in Karachi should have jurisdiction over the matter. The court observed that there were certain admitted facts, including the Nikah Nama (marriage contract) and marriage registration certificate, which showed that the petitioner/husband had a permanent address in Peshawar, and the respondent/wife also had a residence in Peshawar. The court referred to the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, and the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965, which lay down provisions for the jurisdiction of the Family Court. It noted that the Family Court in Peshawar had jurisdiction to entertain matters related to custody of children and visitation rights of parents if the cause of action wholly or partially arose within its jurisdiction, or if the parties last resided together in that jurisdiction. Additionally, if a suit for the dissolution of marriage also included claims mentioned in the proviso to section 7(2) of the Act, such as custody of children, then the Family Court would have jurisdiction over those claims as well. The court found that the respondent/wife ordinarily resided in Peshawar, and both parties had permanent residences there. Therefore, the Family Court in Peshawar had jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate upon the respondent's suit for custody of the minors and other related claims. The court dismissed the writ petition as it lacked merit.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioners, who are the legal representatives of Nazir Ahmad, a deceased civil servant, filed the Constitutional Petition seeking to set aside the order of removal of their predecessor from service and claiming back benefits, financial benefits, pension gratuity, and past salary. The central issue of the case was whether the legal action, challenging the removal of a civil servant from service, survives upon the death of the petitioner during the proceedings. The court ruled that if the right to sue is not intrinsically connected with the individuality of the deceased petitioner and the right to relief or benefit sought can be inherited by the legal heirs, then the legal action does not abate. It was found that the Education Department was aware of the deceased's medical condition. Therefore, the court concluded that the death of the predecessor would not abate the cause of action for the legal representatives to challenge the order of removal and claim pensionary benefits. The court noted that the Service Tribunal had limited jurisdiction and could not entertain a petition from the family or legal representatives of the deceased civil servant. Since there was no other forum available for the legal representatives to seek relief, the court asserted its constitutional jurisdiction and set aside the impugned order of removal. The case was remanded to the Chief Secretary, for reconsideration of the reasons for the predecessor's absence and to pass an appropriate order relating to the grant of pension to the present petitioners within one month from the date of the judgment.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Obviously, in the event of indiscriminate firing by six persons simultaneously, it is absolutely impossible for a victim to note with exactitude that whose fire hits him on a particular part of his body. Surprisingly, it is the complainant who has performed such miracle by differentiating roles of accused/respondents in the commission of offence and that too when he received injuries on his hips. As per medical evidence, the injured complainant was fired at from back side in view of the locale of injuries. In such circumstances, surely no one can take notice of firing being made from behind him.The story narrated by the complainant in his report suggests that the occurrence has not taken place in the mode and manner as alleged by him. There is something which was suppressed by the complainant in order to rope in falsely various persons of the same family by ascribing them different roles in the commission of the offence. Thus, the statement of the injured complainant in the circumstances of the case does not ring truth. Mere stamp of injuries on the person of a witness would not be a proof of the fact that whatever he deposes would be the truthful account of the events. His veracity is to be tested from the circumstances of the case and his own statement whether it fits in the circumstances of the case or otherwise. Appeal against acquittal dismissed in limine.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Perusal of the record reveals that the learned trial Court while passing the impugned order, has referred to Section 21-A of West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 which provides that a family Court may pass an interim order to preserve and protect any property in dispute.It is clear that these provisions are discretionary, however, such discretion was structured/limited by the subsequent words any property in dispute . The petitioner/husband in his reply to application for sealing of the dowry articles very frankly expressed his willingness to hand over the dowry articles lying in his house to the respondent/wife. Thus, there remained no the point of disagreement or dispute over the dowry articles lying in husband s house, and as such, in the absence any property in dispute, the scope of discretion of the Family Court under section 21-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, vanished.Under section 21-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964, a family court has not been vested with powers to issue direction for any kind of sealing rather the words preserve and protect have been used in this section. The dictionary meaning of PRESERVE are to maintain (something) in its original or existing state or to keep safe from injury, harm, or destruction. Whereas, dictionary meaning of PROTECT are to keep safe from harm or injury or to cover or shield from exposure, injury, damage, or destruction.Family Court has illegally prevented the petitioner and inmates of his house to use the said rooms of their own house which by itself is violative of the provisions of Article 24(1) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. In-fact learned family court has passed the order to seal the rooms of the house of petitioner/husband which were not the subject matter of the family suit.",

Similarly, all the owners in the village Galla are also joint owners of Shamilat of it and their shares shall be proportionate to the size of their holding vis-a-vis total land in the village excluding malikan-e-qabza.

Every criminal case has a sad story to tell and that the attending circumstancesof the cases shocks one's mind to the extreme, but this alone cannot be considered adetermining factor to determine the fate of the parties involved. If on one hand, thefamilies of those who lose their lives are the worst sufferers, then on the other, theaccused charged and his family is also expecting fair trial from the courts of law.II). Once the Court comes to a conclusion that the number of accused is exaggerated and once it forms an opinion from the attending circumstances of a particular case that the act committed was the doing of a limited number of accused then the exaggerated charge brought by the complainant will react upon the veracity and authenticity of the collected material and recorded statements.III). Though, medical evidence is confirmatory in nature and in presence of trustworthyand confidence inspiring eye witness account, it cannot overshadow the same, but in case where the eye witness account fails to convince on a particular aspect of the case, then the conflict between the two would creep down to the roots. As in the present case, the testimony of the complainant regarding the mode, manner and the number of accused charged does not convince the judicial mind of this Court: so this Court lurks no doubt in mind that the conflict between the ocular account and the medical evidence has damaged the prosecution case beyond repair.IV). Since immemorial, it has been held that beffer to acquit ten culprits than to convictan innocent soul. Both the English Jurisprudence as well as our religion are inconsonance on this particular aspect of acquittal and conviction. We went through therelevant record as keen observers, but could not lay hands on any concrete evidencewhich could convince that all the accused charged are responsible for the deaths of thedeceased and injury to the complainant. When a stage comes, where it becomesimpossible that who, out of the accused charged, committed the offence, then the courtsare Left with limited option to fix the liability and in such eventuality, the benefit of thesame is always extended to all the accused charged.(Criminal appeal allowed)",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner filed a suit seeking the recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and dissolution of marriage under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. The respondent, the petitioner\u2019s husband, contested the suit. The trial court granted a decree in favor of the petitioner for dower, maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and dissolved the marriage on the basis of non-payment of maintenance. The respondent's appeal partially reduced the maintenance period. Both parties filed writ petitions challenging the judgments. ----Issues: 1- Whether the respondent was entitled to maintenance allowance and, if so, for how long? 2- Whether the marriage could be dissolved under Section 2(ii) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 due to non-payment of maintenance for two years? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Maintenance Allowance Entitlement and Period: The court held that the respondent was entitled to maintenance as per Muslim law, which requires a husband to provide for his wife\u2019s basic needs, including food, clothing, and shelter. The petitioner failed to prove that he paid maintenance. The court cited various precedents affirming that the limitation period for claiming past maintenance is six years under Article 120 of the Limitation Act, 1908. Thus, the trial court's decree for maintenance for the past 19 years was rightly modified to six years by the appellate court. --Dissolution of Marriage: The court found that non-payment of maintenance for two years constitutes a valid ground for dissolution of marriage under Section 2(ii) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. The respondent was not maintained for 19 years, fulfilling the requirement of an unbroken period of non-maintenance. The argument that the petitioner and respondent resided together for a short period in 2016 did not negate the overall neglect. The writ petitions challenging the judgments were dismissed, and the parties were directed to bear their own costs. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Hanif Khan Vs Mst: Umar Dara and 03 others (PLD 2021 Peshawar 184) Wasim Nawaz & 02 others Vs.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: i. The witnesses failed to confirm the presence of their shops in the local Bazaar and even no independent witness was produced in that respect and as such the witnesses failed to convince this Court that it was because of their joint business that they were heading back to their houses when the tragedy occurred. Even the investigating officer could not collect any evidence in that respect, more particularly no witness from the said Bazaar was examined.ii. The presence of the complainant and PW Ramzan at the place of incident and at the time of incident is nothing but a co-incidence which does not appeal to a prudent mind.iii. The record tells that as many as five male members of the same family are charged and that it is for the prosecution to convince that all of them participated in killing of the deceased and causing injuries to the complainant. Another intriguing aspect of the case is, that the investigating officer during spot inspection collected 14 empties from the spot, but the same were not sent to the Fire Arms Expert to determine that the same were fired from one or different weapons. Had a single accused been charged then it was less important to send the recovered empties to the laboratory but in case of five accused it was obligatory, but its non-sending to the expert is a circumstance which the prosecution could not overcome and which has damaged the prosecution case beyond repair.iv. It is interesting to note that while reporting the matter, that too, in the hospital the scribe did not feel the need to ask from the doctor, a certificate, regarding the capability of the complainant to talk, admittedly, neither any certificate was obtained from the doctor, nor an opinion of the doctor was sought to confirm that the complainant was capable to talk. The severity of injuries on body of the complainant is a factor which cannot be lightly ignored and the same has increased the anxiety of this Court regarding his physical condition at the time, when he allegedly, reported the matter. The doctor was examined as PW-4 who stated that the injured was produced to him alongwith the injury sheet and that thereafter the injured was examined and his medico legal certificate was prepared. The doctor also confirmed that no opinion was asked by the scribe at the time of report and that he was not associated with the process.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The question before this Court is as to whether the grandfather could be held liable to pay maintenance allowance to his grandchildren? The answer to above question is that under Islamic law, a grandfather can be held liable to pay maintenance to his grandchildren if certain conditions are met. In general, maintenance (nafqah) is a right that is granted to certain family members under Islamic law, including children, parents, and spouses. This right requires that the person who is responsible for providing maintenance, usually the father or husband, must provide financial support to the dependent family member(s) to cover their basic needs such as food, clothing, and shelter.As for the case of grandchildren, the responsibility for providing maintenance falls first on their father, and if he is unable to provide or not alive then it falls on their paternal grandfather. This is based on the principle of nearer in degree (qarabah), which means that the closer family member is responsible for providing maintenance before the more distant one.However, it is important to note that the grandfather's responsibility for providing maintenance to his grandchildren is not absolute and may vary depending on the circumstances. It is important to note that the extent of a grandfather's responsibility for providing maintenance to his grandchildren will depend on various factors, including the financial situation of the grandfather, the needs of the grandchildren, and the availability of other sources of support. In some cases, a grandfather may be exempt from this obligation if he is unable to provide for his own basic needs or is facing other financial difficulties. Overall, the determination of a grandfather's liability for providing maintenance to his grandchildren will depend on the specific circumstances of the case and the interpretation of Islamic legal principles by family judge but this shall be decided after recording of evidence.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Conviction upheld---Background: The appellant was convicted by the Additional Sessions Judge, Buner, for the murder of Mst. Gul Mena. The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), with additional penalties under sections 544-A, Cr.P.C., and 15-A.A. The case involves the murder of Mst. Gul Mena, who had married her husband, Amir Khan, against her family's wishes. The initial complaint blamed Mst. Gul Mena's brother, Bakhti Mand, but the accusation later shifted to Mst. Rainaz, the complainant's sister. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction of Mst. Rainaz was based on valid and voluntary confessional evidence. 2- Whether the shift in the complainant's accusation from Bakhti Mand to Mst. Rainaz was credible and justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Issue 1: Validity and Voluntariness of Confessional Evidence The appellant's conviction heavily relied on her confessional statement recorded by a Judicial Magistrate. The court examined whether this confession was made voluntarily and truthfully. The Magistrate's procedure and certification were scrutinized, including the timeline and the appellant's understanding of her rights and the consequences of her confession. The Magistrate gave the appellant multiple opportunities to reconsider her decision and ensured she was not under duress. --Issue 2: Credibility of the Shift in Accusation Initially, Amir Khan accused Bakhti Mand of the murder due to previous threats related to the couple's marriage. However, three days after the incident, Amir Khan changed his statement, accusing his sister, Mst. Rainaz, based on her alleged confession to the police. The court evaluated the credibility of this shift, considering the relationships and potential motives. Testimonies from other witnesses, including the deceased's mother and neighbors, were also assessed to support or contradict the new accusation. The court upheld the conviction of Mst. Rainaz, finding her confessional statement to be voluntarily made and consistent with the facts of the case. The evidence supported the prosecution's case that Mst. Rainaz had committed the murder, and the shift in accusation from Bakhti Mand to Mst. Rainaz was deemed credible based on the circumstances and supporting testimonies. ----Citations/Precedents: The principles for assessing the voluntariness of a confession were referenced from established legal standards, ensuring the accused was not coerced and fully aware of her rights. The case took into account previous rulings on the admissibility and reliability of confessional statements in criminal proceedings.",

Appellant/complainant (PW-2) in his examination-in-crosspointed out that the accused Hizbullah had made a single fire,accused Hizbullah and his deceased brother were face to face atthe time of firing, whereas, the postmortem report of thedeceased shows firearm injury on lower back of chest on leftside. He further stated that as he was injured and was not in fullsenses, therefore, he cannot say that when his brother died aftersustaining injuries. He further stated that he was injured throughthe blows of hatchets and no one has fired at him, however, hismedical report shows the injury sustained by him as blunt. Thedoctor (PW-1) admitted in his examination-in-cross that theinjuries sustained by the injured are possible by falling on earth.2. PW-3 stated that they shifted the deceased and the injured to thehospital in a private Datsun, however, due particulars of thevehicle, as its registration number, the name of driver etc, areneither part & parcel of the investigation nor that of the trial. PW-3further stated that so many people gathered on the spot and took thedead body of his son as well as injured but he was unable todisclose their names.3. One independent witness Muhammad Ayub was allegedlypresent on the spot and his statement was recorded under Section161 Cr.PC which is Ex.PW-10/D-2. The name of saidMuhammad Ayub is neither mentioned in the murasila/FIR norhe has been examined in the case as prosecution witness. Hecould have strengthened the case of the prosecution; but his nonproduction as prosecution witness has adversely affected its casein view of the provisions of Article 129, Illustration (g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984.4. No doubt, appellant/complainant (PW-2) sustained injuries on hisperson during the occurrence but this fact alone cannot beconsidered sufficient to hold that he has spoken the whole truth.5. It appears that the occurrence has not taken place in the manner assuggested by the prosecution and a wide net has been thrown by theprosecution to implicate all the male members of the respondent sfamily.6. The peculiar facts and circumstances are sufficient enough thatstrong presumption can be ruled out that the occurrence has nottaken place in the mode and manner so reported and presented bythe prosecution and the prosecution failed to prove its case beyondshadow of any doubt.",

The legal framework involved included the Succession Act, 1925, among other laws and international legal principles.The deceased, Tahir Ahmed Khan, left behind an estate comprising both movable and immovable properties, including bank accounts in Pakistan and properties in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The court noted that all legal heirs, including the petitioner, were the deceased's children, and the deceased's former wife was not a legal heir due to a prior divorce recognized by the relevant authority.The application process included the submission of necessary documents such as the death certificate, family registration, and affidavits from independent witnesses. Notices were published in widely circulated newspapers, and no adverse claims were filed against the estate. The court discussed the maintainability of the petition, referencing a Supreme Court judgment and comparing it with the present case's facts, especially regarding the jurisdiction over properties situated abroad.The court distinguished the current case from previous judgments, taking into account the non-contentious nature of the matter and the parties' submission to the court's jurisdiction. It highlighted the reciprocal arrangements for the enforcement of judgments between Pakistan and other countries, including the UK and UAE, which would allow for the recognition and execution of the court's orders in those jurisdictions.Ultimately, the court granted the petition, emphasizing the global context of legal matters and the importance of addressing the rights and interests of ordinary citizens in a \"global village.\" The petitioner was instructed to file an interim report and account for the estate as per the Succession Act's requirements.",

The earlier view will be the binding precedent till such time it is in the field.2. Family court has no jurisdiction under clause 9 of Schedule to Section 5 of the Family Court Acts, 1964 in cases of enforcement of clause 18 and 19 of the Nikahnama which are dependent on the happening of or related to KHULA or DIVORCE. It vests in the ordinary courts as settled by the Supreme Court in the case of Mukhtar Hussaid Shah (PLD 2011 SC 260)A supreme court judgment, though later in time, is not binding if it has not considered an earlier view of a bench of co-equal strength; nor has referred the matter for constitution of a larger bench. The earlier view will be the binding precedent till such time it is in the field. --- The appellate judgment had modified a trial court decision from December 6, 2018, regarding the enforcement of conditions stated in column Nos. 18 & 19 of the Nikahnama (marriage contract).The core issue revolved around the enforcement of specific conditions in the Nikahnama, which stipulated a sum of Rs. 1,000,000 to be paid to the wife in the event of divorce by the husband. The trial court had concluded that such conditions could not be enforced as they were contrary to the principles of marital ties, which should not be bound by stringent conditions. However, the appellate court granted relief to the respondent based on these conditions, arguing that the family court had jurisdiction over the matter.Upon review, the High Court noted discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence regarding the Nikahnama's conditions. It observed that the matter was not adequately addressed on factual grounds by the lower courts, which instead focused on legal interpretations without first establishing the factual basis of the case. The High Court emphasized the importance of resolving factual discrepancies before applying legal principles.Furthermore, the High Court discussed the jurisdiction of family courts in matters involving conditions stipulated in the Nikahnama, referencing various Supreme Court judgments to clarify the legal stance on such issues. It concluded that the appellate court's judgment granting relief based on the contested conditions was not only beyond its jurisdiction but also unsupported by the evidence on record.The High Court ultimately set aside the appellate court's judgment, restoring the trial court's decision. The petition was allowed, highlighting the necessity of a factual basis for legal decisions and the proper application of jurisdiction in family law matters.",

It was highlighted that the minor had been unlawfully taken from the mother's custody and raised concerns about potential influence or harassment by the father (Opponent No.1) who had another wife.The petitioner, presumably the father, challenged this order, seeking to nullify it and to have the minor's custody transferred to him. The petitioner's argument was based on legal precedents emphasizing that matters of custody should be addressed under the Guardians and Wards Act and that the High Court's jurisdiction under Section 491 Cr.P.C. is to be exercised sparingly.The High Court, after reviewing the submissions and the relevant legal precedents, decided not to interfere with the impugned order. The Court found no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances warranting its intervention. It was noted that a guardianship application was already pending before the appropriate Family Court, which was competent to decide on the custody issue.The High Court concluded that the impugned order was passed with due consideration, including conditions that were in the minor's best interest, such as the requirement for a P.R Bond and the stipulation that the minor's custody could not be removed from the District of Matiari.Thus, the High Court dismissed the petition, maintaining that the observations made were tentative and would not impact any ongoing or future litigation between the parties regarding this matter.",

When the respondent/ father surrendered to the jurisdiction of the trial Court by moving an application under section 25 of the Guardian & Wards Act, it was promptly responded and replied by filing written statement and jurisdiction conceded by petitioner.--Once petitioner acquiesced to the jurisdiction, she cannot approbate and reprobate at the same time. The question of jurisdiction even if made dependent on ordinary residence of ward, it may not be a pure question of law that can be assailed at any forum or at any time. For that it has to be specifically pleaded so that the facts in this regard be brought to the notice of the Court. It is, thus, not a simple question of law rather a mixed question of law and facts which requires determination through evidence.--Movement or Restriction in Movement of ward-The ward belongs to a family which can afford a better upbringing, education and environment either in Pakistan or anywhere in the world which was restricted and curtailed by restriction in his movement. The Courts below should not have seen welfare only from the angle that the father/respondent must not miss his opportunity to see his child but it must also be seen from the angle as to whether a ward who is capable of studying abroad, in case the opportunities are available to him, should he be deprived of on account of the fact that father must not miss a visiting opportunity? --In any other case it would have been the welfare considering the situation of the ward while being at Karachi and only Pakistani national but the situation here is different as the child is privileged to have access to any educational institution around the world including Pakistan. An educational institute or an environment for which most of the children could only dream for. Every child has its own peculiar circumstances and the welfare demands may vary. The restriction in the movement in the present case appeared to be a tool to settle score with mother/petitioner but it will not serve as the welfare of the child. The father/respondent who had raised serious allegations against the mother/petitioner as he claimed that she is not fit to take care of ward yet is not serious in having the custody of the ward, although none of them stands proved in evidence. There are ways and mechanism to regulate the movement which is not achieved by of restricting the movement.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In the High Court of Sindh, Karachi, a group of Constitutional Petitions (CP) were filed with regard to project allowances received by the petitioners while working on the \"Up-gradation and Modernization of Building of Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) Laboratories Complex, Karachi.\" The petitions were heard before Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Adnan-ul-Karim Memon. This memorandum outlined the conditions under which project allowances would be granted to staff working on development projects funded from the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP). The respondents, represented by PCSIR, contended that the project allowance was not rightfully granted to the petitioners and that recovery of the allowance was justified due to irregularities identified through monitoring and auditing processes. They argued that the allowance was not approved for regular PCSIR employees and was intended for those specifically appointed for project-related roles. The court examined the relevant documents, including the Office Memorandum, and considered the circumstances under which the project allowance was granted to the petitioners. The court highlighted discrepancies in the treatment of the petitioners by PCSIR, including their continued service without any objection regarding the allowance during the project's duration. The court noted that the benefits of the project allowance should not be deducted from the family pension of the deceased Project Director and should also not be deducted from the pension of retired petitioners. It directed the competent authority of the respondents to conduct a proper inquiry into the allegations against serving petitioners and to conclude the proceedings within a specified timeframe. The court's decision aimed to address the issue of whether the project allowance was rightfully granted to the petitioners and whether the deductions from pension and salary were justified. The decision emphasized the importance of adhering to rules and regulations while also considering the circumstances under which benefits were granted.",

However, it was revealed that the petitioner had concealed information about the same order and an appeal against it, which was dismissed on 15.05.2014. The petitioner also alleged misreading of evidence and sought the return of various items, including bridal gifts.In response, the respondent No.1's counsel argued that the lower courts had correctly decided the case, and there was no misreading of evidence. They also pointed out that the petitioner's conduct in concealing information was questionable.The judge reviewed the arguments and found that the petitioner failed to establish any justifiable infirmity in the lower courts' judgments. The judge noted that the petitioner's conduct before the court did not entitle him to any discretionary relief. Consequently, on 20.02.2018, the judge dismissed the petition and the associated application.",

The court decreed in favor of the respondent, and the petitioner failed to fulfill the maintenance and dowry payments as ordered. Consequently, the respondent pursued legal action, including a warrant of arrest against the petitioner. The Official Assignee, representing the court, submits that the petitioner's situation does not qualify for insolvency under the Insolvency Act. The Official Assignee suggests that the matter is a marital issue rather than a business-related insolvency matter and recommends pursuing appropriate legal channels. The petitioner contests this view, asserting that his health prevents him from working and that he relies on the assistance of others for survival. The judge, considers the legal definitions of \"debt\" and \"maintenance.\" He concludes that the decree for maintenance does not constitute a debt under the Insolvency Act and that the petitioner's obligation to provide maintenance to his wife is not a debt within the Act's meaning. As a result, the judge dismisses the insolvency petition, declaring it not maintainable and lacking legal merit.",

The court emphasized the importance of swift resolutions in family matters and dismissed Aslam's petition for lacking merit, upholding the original decree of dissolution by Khula.

From the statement of landlord/owner for the purpose of eviction of a tenant on the ground of personal bona fide need only an honest intention is to be deduced and there is no other formula to adjudge good and bad faith, for the purpose of eviction on the aforesaid count. If the Court on the scrutiny of the evidence comes to the conclusion that it was an honest intention then it would be immaterial whether he remained successful in achieving the object or not that is whether his son or daughter would join him in the business after completing their education. This requirement would be immaterial in the sense that the intention of the father in evicting the tenant was an honest one.Good faith is an abstract term not capable of any rigid definition and ordinary dictionary meaning describes it as \"honesty of intention\".-The primary requirement and condition precedent for invoking provision of Section 15(2)(vii) of Sindh Rented Premises Ordinance, 1979 claiming relief on the ground of personal bonafide need of landlord in good faith is that the landlord should be honest in his approach and sincerity of his purpose should be manifested by irreversible evidence and surrounding circumstances.- Sufficiency of accommodation either for a commercial/industrial activity or for residential purpose is to be adjudged best by the landlord himself and it may vary not only on case to case basis but also on the basis of nature of business that one intends to establish an honest idea about future growth of the business and its prospects. Someone may have an idea of establishing humongous business set up and he may or may not be successful in achieving his object and plan but what is 9important, as a test, is the honesty of intention and there is nothing on record in the shape of cross-examination of the landlord/owner to demonstrate that it was not an honest and genuine intention for extending and enhancing business for himself and for his family members.",

And then the Court went on to observe that even if there is adecree of the Court, the stamp duty would be payable as per ValuationTable. Though on facts the said judgment is not relevant; nonetheless,since it has been cited before this Full Bench, therefore, we arecompelled to hold that we do not approve such observations made bythe Division Bench in the aforesaid paragraph. Had it been inperformance of decree, an instrument is being registered, it ought to beon the basis of value determined in the decree and/or agreemententered into for which performance is to be made in terms of Courtdecree. In such situation there was no occasion for altering/undervaluingthe property to avoid stamp duty as the value is already determined byCourt of law or decree. It is only in case when the property has changedits status lawfully i.e. from a built-up property to an open plot or from asemi-constructed property to a fully constructed property, the value ofthe property may be altered in instrument sought to be registered. Thus,when the property sold out on the basis of a decree, which decree hasvalued the property in question, then the right of valuing the propertydoes not rest with the vendor and vendee and/or the concernedauthority.

Accordingly, the interim pre-arrest bail granted to him vide order dated 08.07.2021 is hereby confirmed on the same terms and conditions---- The applicant, Muhammad Waleed, sought admission to bail pending trial in a case registered against him under Sections 337-F(vi) and 34 PPC at P.S. Zaman Town Korangi Karachi. The complainant, Abdul Rasheed, alleged that Waleed and two unknown persons attacked and injured him when he visited his in-laws' house. The complainant claimed injuries, and an FIR was registered. Waleed was initially granted interim pre-arrest bail, but it was later dismissed. The applicant argued that he is falsely implicated due to family disputes, emphasizing the element of enmity and stating that the injuries fall under Munaqqilah, not within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 P.P.C.The complainant and the Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application, citing the specific role assigned to the applicant in the FIR. The judge noted that the injury attribution requires further inquiry since three persons were nominated, and the prosecution did not establish whether the complainant was injured by Waleed alone or collectively by all attackers. The judge observed a family dispute and noted that the alleged offense did not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. Additionally, he highlighted a delay in filing the FIR. Considering these factors, the judge applied the principle that bail is a rule and refusal an exception in such cases. The progress report indicated the completion of the investigation and framing of charges. The judge concluded that the applicant would not be required for further investigation, and there was no risk of evidence tampering. Therefore, the judge confirmed the interim pre-arrest bail, allowing the bail application on the same terms and conditions.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Service matters (Pension matters) --- The petitioner's husband, Shoukat Ali Panhwar, was appointed as a Mukhtiarkar in BPS-16 in 1978.He was subsequently promoted to Assistant Commissioner (BPS-17) on an ad-hoc basis in 1984 and later as Deputy Secretary/Equivalent (BPS-18) on a regular basis in 1998.On May 9, 1999, Shoukat Ali Panhwar was allegedly kidnapped by dacoits and subsequently went missing.A FIR was registered regarding his disappearance on January 14, 2000.After seven years of his disappearance, the Respondent No.3 issued a notification on July 26, 2006, which retired Shoukat Ali Panhwar and allowed family pension to his legal heirs for the period of service until the date of his disappearance (May 9, 1999).The petitioner contended that her husband's services should have been counted until seven years from the date of his disappearance, and all benefits should be calculated accordingly.The petitioner claimed that due to the non-counting of the seven-year missing period, she suffered substantial financial losses in pension, insurance, Benevolent Fund, and G.P. Fund.The petitioner filed a civil suit for the declaration of her husband's death, which was decreed on March 19, 2010, with the date of death determined as May 9, 1999.Issues:The main issue in this case was whether the services of the petitioner's husband should be counted for pensionary benefits from the date of his disappearance on May 9, 1999, or from the date of the issuance of the impugned notification on July 26, 2006.Holding:The court held that the petitioner's claim for family pension from July 26, 2006, was not sustainable in law. It referred to Article 124 of the Qanoon-e-Shahdat Order 1984, which requires that if an employee remains missing or unheard of for a period of seven years to the satisfaction of the department, family pension may be allowed to his heirs as admissible under the prescribed rules. Since the petitioner herself had reported her husband as missing since May 9, 1999, and the department had issued the notification after the statutory seven-year waiting period, the claim for family pension from the date of his disappearance was dismissed.Outcome:The petition was dismissed as devoid of merit, and the impugned notification dated July 26, 2006, was upheld as issued in accordance with the law.",

It is not disputed that accused Agha Siraj Khan Durani is a politician and has held different positions. Therefore, when he buys a property in the name of his wife or children, or makes payments at their behest for this purpose, there would normally be no reason for them to get alarmed or suspect that he has done corruption and is providing money from the wealth earned by him as such. Normal presumption, his children or for that matter any prudent mind would get, would be of his acting bona fide and providing the amounts from his legitimate sources of income.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, seeking a directive for the Pakistan Railways to issue 50% family pension to her, recalling the pension order passed in favor of her unmarried sister. The petitioner, a divorced daughter of the deceased employee, argued that she was entitled to an equal share of the family pension along with her unmarried sister, as per the updated regulations on pension benefits. ----Issues: 1- Whether the petitioner, as a divorced daughter of a deceased government employee, is entitled to a share of the family pension along with the unmarried daughter. 2- Whether the relevant rules and policies support the petitioner's claim to the family pension. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the petitioner, being a divorced daughter, is entitled to the family pension benefits as per the updated rules issued by the Government of Pakistan, Finance Division (Regulations Wing). The court reasoned that the policy regarding family pension had been liberalized to include widowed and divorced daughters along with unmarried daughters. The updated Office Memorandum dated 19.06.2018 clearly allowed for the distribution of pension among unmarried daughters, widowed daughters, and divorced daughters of the deceased employee. The court concluded that the respondents (Pakistan Railways and related authorities) should divide the family pension equally between the surviving unmarried daughter and the divorced daughter until either marries/remarries. The petitioner's right to pension is recognized as a fundamental right, and the court directed compliance with the updated regulations. ----Citations/Precedents: Office Memorandum No.1(13)-Reg.6/83 dated 23.10.1983 by the Government of Pakistan, Finance Division (Regulation Wing-II) Office Memorandum No.F.2(2)-Reg.6/96-IX-700 dated 07.07.2015 by the Government of Pakistan, Finance Division (Regulation Wing) Office Memorandum No.F.13(16)-Reg.6/2017-516 dated 19.06.2018 by the Government of Pakistan, Finance Division (Regulation Wing) Zakia Shaukat Rizvi v.

The petitioner's counsel argues for the maintainability of the petition, claiming that the petitioner has the right to pursue the relief sought.

Ultimately, the Court rules that the petition is not maintainable under the given circumstances and dismisses the petition along with all listed applications. The Court's decision is based on the understanding that seeking constitutional jurisdiction to challenge interlocutory orders should be limited to exceptional cases where grave injustice or abuse of process is evident.

The scheme benefits those falling under the definition of \"Family\" as per pension rules. The judges note that despite the petitioner's claim of reconciliation, her obtained Khula decree is a significant legal barrier to claiming the Family Pension. They conclude that a divorced wife's status cannot be recognized as a family member for pension entitlement, and her claim is dismissed.

There is no cavil that in terms of para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F Mulla's, a grandfather in certain circumstances is bound to maintain his grandchildren but obligation of the grandfather to maintain his grandchildren is hedged with certain conditions. In order to understand the matter in issue in better terms, para 370 of Muhammadan Law by D.F. Mulla's. Primarily it is the father who is bound to maintain his children, in case of son(s) until he (they) attain(s) the age of puberty and if there are daughters, till their marriage. In case, the father is poor and incapable of maintaining by his own, the mother would come into picture and if she is in easy circumstances, she would be bound to maintain her children in place of father. The liability of grandfather though starts when the father is poor and infirm and the mother is also not in a position to provide maintenance to her children but such liability of grandfather is dependent upon the fact that he should be in easy circumstances. After having a glimpse of the survey of law on the subject, I am of the firm view that Family Court can never be helpless to get its decree executed. The process of execution cannot shift towards the grandfather merely on the ground that decree could not be satisfied against the father (judgment debtor). The Family Court cannot assume the role of spectator rather it can adopt the procedure contained in \"CPC\" for the execution of the decree.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In appropriate cases, learned Family Courts to consider principle of appreciation in value of certain dowry articles: In present case, alternate value of car given in dowry was fixed as Rs.2,285,000/- by the learned Appellate Court below that is the amount, which was paid by the father of respondent No.3 when the car was booked in the year 2017, when the marriage of respondent No.3 with the petitioner took place. This Court is of the view that primarily a suit for the return of dowry articles, whenever decided, is decreed by the Courts as such with the observation that in case of failure, on part of the judgment-debtor, to return the said articles, as an alternate, the amount equivalent to the price of dowry articles is ordered to be paid and while determining the alternate value of the dowry articles, the Courts consider the depreciation of most of the dowry articles on account of normal and natural wear and tear thereof that takes place over the passage of time since marriage of the parties. The rationale underlying the application of principle of depreciation is that the dowry articles are to be returned in their current position and if the same is not done, their price is to be paid as an alternate and since most of the value of dowry articles put to use during the subsistence of marriage do undergo depreciation on account of said daily use, therefore, while determining the alternate price, it is justifiable that the depreciation in value of such articles is to be taken into account. However, one cannot lose sight of the fact that there may be some articles forming part of the dowry, for instance, the gold ornaments or the vehicles or even few electrical appliances etc., value whereof may appreciate over the years. The car, in the instant case is such an article. Therefore, the learned Appellate Court below erred in not considering the appreciation in the value of the car while fixing/determining the alternate price thereof inasmuch as this is common knowledge that value of Pak Rupees has depreciated over the number of years and the value of new as well as used vehicles, like the car in instant case, is on continuous rise. Therefore, awarding amount spent on purchase of the car in the year 2017 is not justified and respondent No.3 is held entitled to recover the market value of the car as on date of realization of the decree.",

The petitioner, contests the jurisdiction of the trial court where her husband filed a suit for judicial separation under Hindu Family Laws. While the husband claimed residency within the jurisdiction of Police Station Bhitai Nagar Hyderabad, the petitioner contested this assertion, claiming the husband's last residence was in village Rajo Khanani, District Hyderabad. The court examined Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family Court Rules 1965, which determined jurisdiction based on the cause of action and the residency of the parties. It noted that the husband, being Hindu, filed a suit for judicial separation under Hindu laws, attempting to establish jurisdiction based on the cause of action. However, the court found discrepancies in the addresses provided by both parties and questioned the validity of the cause of action at the mentioned police station. The court partially allowed the petition, setting aside the impugned order and restoring the application for reconsideration based on the facts presented. It emphasized that the transfer of a case should not be solely for the convenience of the parties and directed the trial court to frame and dispose of the issue of jurisdiction within one month, with evidence if necessary, in accordance with Rule 6 of the Family Court Rules 1965. The order rendered the transfer application moot, as the trial court would now reconsider the jurisdictional issues. The court instructed expeditious handling of the matter, not exceeding six weeks, to decide the question of jurisdiction.",

So for this purpose, recourse can be made to section 2 (2) of the Code of Civil Procedure (V of 1908), which defines the decree. After having a glimpse of the definition of decree, no doubt left that a decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which, so far as regards the Court expressing it, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final. It shall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint the determination of any question within section 144 and an order under rules 60, 98, 99, 101 or 103 of Order XXI but shall not include any adjudication from which an appeal lies as an appeal from an order or any order of dismissal for default. Suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed in terms of section 10 (4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The decision was compound, which on the one hand dissolved the marriage interse parties and on the other dissolution was made subject to return of dower. Section 13 of the Family Courts Act, 1964 provides the manner of enforcement of decrees The manner and form of decree is provided in the West Pakistan Family Court Rules, 1965. Rules 16 and 17, for the said purpose, are more relevant The above discussion leads to irresistible conclusion that the order dated 8th December, 2010 resulting into dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula subject to return of dower, for all intent and purposes, was a decree under section 13 of the \"Act, 1964\" and was executable.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Pension for family in case of deceased persons---The order in question pertains and concerns the eligibility for family pension of certain individuals in relation to a deceased employee. After considering the arguments and relevant laws, the court examined the applicability of Rule 4.10 of the West Pakistan Civil Servants Pension Rules 1963. The court determined that the petitioner, as the husband of the deceased employee, was entitled to the family pension under Rule 4.10(2)(i)(a).The court also evaluated Rule 4.10(2)(v), which addresses the entitlement of the eldest surviving son of a deceased government servant, and Rule 4.10(1)(b), which deals with the division of pension among widows and eligible children. The court found that neither of these rules provided any benefits to the sisters of the deceased employee. The respondents' counsel cited the case of Muhammad Mumtaz v. Mst. Umra Bevi and another, which pertained to the entitlement of a widowed sister of a deceased employee who died without issue. However, the court noted that this case did not apply to the current situation, as it involved a different scenario where the deceased employee's husband had not survived. The court allowed the petition and set aside the impugned order. The petitioner, in accordance with the relevant rules, was deemed eligible for the family pension of the deceased employee. The court's decision effectively disposed of the petition.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: It is settled principle that the Courts must aid the fair administration of justice by ensuring that litigation must come to an end by not allowing a litigant to agitate a particular ground and/or cause of action again and again, by filing successive applications, as the same amounts to abuse of process of law, causes hardship to the other side and runs counter to public policy that issue once decided and attained finality, cannot be reopened. Therefore, once order dated 24.10.2019 of the learned Executing Court was upheld by the learned Appellate Court below, the respondent cannot be allowed to agitate the same ground as such a leverage to a litigant to file successive applications defeats the principle of public policy discussed hereinabove. On another plain, this Court is cognizant of the fact that in case the judgments of the learned Courts below are at variance, preference should be given to the judgment of the learned Appellate Court below, more particularly, in family matters as held in case reported as \"Mst. Farah Naz v. Judge Family Court, Sahiwal and others\" (PLD 2006 SC 457). However, in view of the above discussion, this is a fit case for interference in constitutional jurisdiction by this Court as the learned Appellate Court below has acted without appreciating the material available on record. In fact, the learned Appellate Court below acted in excess of jurisdiction inasmuch as by passing the impugned order, the learned Appellate Court below has reviewed its earlier order dated 22.01.2020 whereby the learned Appellate Court below upheld the order of the learned Executing Court dated 24.10.2019 dismissing the claim of the respondent to receive alternate value of dowry articles. Jurisdiction to review its earlier order is not vested with the learned Appellate Court below. Therefore, the impugned order cannot sustain.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Held that after insertion of the word 'Guardianship' in the First Schedule of The West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, the remedy by way of appeal is available against an order under Section 12 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 although earlier, as per Section 47 of the Act, 1890, the right of appeal was not available. It has been further held that plain reading of Section 12(1) of the Act, 1890 indicates that the overarching and controlling position held by the welfare of a minor in granting his permanent custody under Section 25 of the Act, 1890 is equally applicable to the grant of interim custody under Section 12 of the Act ibid and it will defeat the legislative intent and object of the law if the paramount interest of welfare of a minor is considered supreme and dominant feature only at the time of deciding application under Section 25 of the Act and not so at the time of deciding an application under Section 12 thereof. Thus, the welfare of a minor is always to be controlling force at every stage and decision made under Section 12 of the Act, 1890 is no exception. In the instant case, the respondent/father was allowed to retain the custody of the minor, who was admittedly of tender age of four years, which has been held not to be in best interest of the minor inasmuch as the minor of such tender age, at an interim stage, should not be deprived from the love and care which a mother can extend since such deprivation has far reaching impact on mental and physical upbringing of the minor, which is not the object of Section 12 of the Act, 1890.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner challenged the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and the Appellate Court, which decreed a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance filed by the respondents (the petitioner's wife and minor daughters). The Family Court had previously closed the petitioner's right to file a written statement, which was upheld by the High Court. The Family Court then decreed the suit for maintenance allowance, which was upheld by the Appellate Court. The petitioner contended that the closure of his right to file a written statement was not justified and that the maintenance allowance was beyond his financial capacity. -----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court had the authority to close the right to file a written statement of the defendant under the Family Courts Act, 1964. 2- Whether the defendant could still cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses, lead evidence, and take part in arguments even after the right to file a written statement was closed. 3- Whether the maintenance allowance awarded was beyond the financial capacity of the petitioner. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Authority to Close Right to File Written Statement: The Court held that while the Family Courts Act, 1964 does not explicitly provide for closing the right to file a written statement, courts have inherent power to ensure the orderly dispensation of justice. In the case of a defendant's persistent default, Family Courts can make an order similar to Order VIII Rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, striking off the right to file a written statement. This principle was supported by precedents such as \"Khalil-ur-Rehman Bhutta v. Razia Naz and another\" (1984 CLC 890) and \"Fakhar Abbas Versus Additional District Judge Tandlianwala District Faisalabad and 3 others\" (2017 CLC Note 22). --Defendant's Rights After Closure: Even after the right to file a written statement is closed, the defendant retains the right to cross-examine the plaintiff's witnesses, lead evidence to disprove the facts stated in the plaint, and take part in arguments. This was supported by various judgments, including \"NATIONAL LOGISTIC CELL (N.L.C.) Versus HAZRAT ALI and others\" (2010 SCMR 970) and \"MUHAMMAD NADEEM Versus JUDGE FAMILY COURT and 2 others\" (2012 CLC 1361). --Maintenance Allowance and Financial Capacity: The court found that the maintenance allowance awarded to the respondents was reasonable given the petitioner's financial status. The petitioner was a Civil Engineer running a construction business with a monthly income exceeding three hundred thousand rupees. The maintenance allowance of Rs.35,000 per month for each minor daughter and Rs.25,000 for the wife was deemed appropriate and justified, considering the educational needs and livelihood expenses of the respondents. The constitutional petition was dismissed. -----Citations/Precedents: \"Khalil-ur-Rehman Bhutta v. Razia Naz and another\" (1984 CLC 890) \"Fakhar Abbas Versus Additional District Judge Tandlianwala District Faisalabad and 3 others\" (2017 CLC Note 22) \"Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan Versus Additional District Judge, Lahore and others\" (2014 SCMR 1365) \"NATIONAL LOGISTIC CELL (N.L.C.)

Examination of the impugned order/judgment of the Courts below reveals that the learned Courts have not kept the aim, object and scope of the Family Courts Act, 1964 in mind while interpreting the judgment and decree dated 25.11.2010 and have reached to a misconceived conclusion that it will be safe to allow the annual increase from the date of decree instead of the date of institution of the suit. It is pertinent to observe that any ambiguity in the decree as to grant of annual increase from the date of institution or from the date of decree would be so construed as to be not incongruous to the object and purpose of law which is a beneficial legislation and in this manner, the instant case exhibits a fortiori situation inasmuch as when the Act 1964 itself, being beneficial legislation, cannot be construed and interpreted in a manner detrimental to the minor or female, the judgment and decree passed under such law cannot be so interpreted.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner's son, married Azra Nadeem and had three daughters. After Nadim's death on 29th January 2004, the respondents (Nadim's daughters) filed a suit for maintenance against the petitioner, claiming that he stopped providing maintenance after initially supporting them for three years post their father's death. The Family Court ordered interim maintenance at Rs. 800 per month for each respondent, which the petitioner failed to pay. As a result, his defense was struck off, and the suit was decreed in favor of the respondents. The petitioner's appeal was dismissed by the Additional District Judge, Rawalpindi, prompting this writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan. ----Issues: 1- Whether the petitioner, as a Christian grandfather, can be burdened with the liability of maintaining his grandchildren. 2- Whether the Family Court and the Appellate Court erred in law by not properly addressing the legal and religious aspects related to the maintenance claim. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Jurisdiction and Applicability: The Family Courts Act, 1964, applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims, including Christians, for disputes related to marriage and family affairs. Primary Responsibility for Maintenance: The court examined whether a grandfather can be held responsible for the maintenance of his grandchildren under Christian law, especially in the presence of the children's mother. --Procedural Irregularities: The Family Court did not adhere to Section 10 of the Family Courts Act during pre-trial proceedings and issues framing. The suit was decreed under Section 17-A of the Act due to non-payment of interim maintenance by the petitioner without proper judicial consideration. Remand for Proper Adjudication: The court found that both the Family Court and the Appellate Court failed to properly address critical legal and factual aspects of the case. As such, the matter was remanded to the Senior Civil Judge (Family Division), Rawalpindi, for fresh adjudication. The judgments and decrees of the lower courts were set aside. ----Citations/Precedents: Mst. NOREEN IQBAL v. SOHAIL IQBAL and others (2005 CLC 1472) JAGSI v. Shr.

The petitioner also claimed that he had lost faith in the Family Court and accused it of bias towards the respondent.The petitioner appealed to the High Court seeking dismissal of Suit, arguing that it was not maintainable due to lack of jurisdiction and that the respondent was residing outside the territorial limits of the Family Court South. The court noted that the respondent's address had been verified by the concerned police station, which confirmed that she was indeed residing at the address mentioned in the suit. The court ruled that the Family Court South had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and that the respondent had the right to seek dissolution of marriage and related relief.

The order directed the petitioner to received dowry articles listed in the file, dismissing the petitioner's claim for the alternative price of the dowry items. The petitioner, and respondent No.2, Zafar Iqbal, were married in 1992, and a legal dispute arose over dowry articles following their separation. Despite earlier court decrees in favor of the petitioner, the executing court ordered her to receive the dowry articles rather than the alternate price. The petitioner argued that the dowry articles had deteriorated, were replaced by the respondent, and she preferred the alternative price. The court, however, insisted on the physical delivery of the dowry items. The petitioner contended that she had not used the dowry articles since leaving in 2001, and the respondent had been using them. The petitioner successfully challenged the order, citing legal precedents that support the decree holder's right to claim the value of dowry articles if physical delivery is impractical. The judgment also highlighted the earlier writ petition where the petitioner was entitled to recover gold ornaments or their market price. The court concluded that the executing court's observation, insisting on receiving the dowry articles and rejecting the alternate price claim, was not in accordance with the law. As a result, the petition was accepted.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Article 174 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 ordains that the Federation may sue or be sued by the name of Pakistan and a Province may sue or be sued by the name of the Province. Admittedly due compliance was not made to the said mandatory provision of law while filing the constitutional petitions, which sole fact is sufficient for dismissal of constitutional petitions. From the joint analysis of the Contract Appointment Policy, 2004, the Rules, 2003 and relevant provisions of the Act, 2003 reproduced hereinabove, it can safely be inferred that the respondents were not appointed under the Contract Appointment Policy, 2004, as such the notification dated 14th October, 2009 is not attracted to their case. The judgments referred by the learned counsel for the respondents in the cases of 2018 SCMR 1405, 2015 SCMR 1257 and 2013 SCMR 1547, it is observed that in the said cases, though the employees were either daily wagers or contract employees but they were working for a considerable long time against the permanent posts and as such the Hon?ble Supreme Court of Pakistan directed their regularization in service. The facts of the said cases are thus quite distinguishable as compared to the present case. The respondents were since appointed by the Board of Management against temporary posts under the Act, 2003, so they cannot claim similar treatment. There is yet another important aspect that during the pendency of the constitutional petition before the learned Single Bench, the Punjab Regularization of Service Act, 2018 was promulgated, which provides a detailed mechanism qua the regularization of the services of contract employees. The respondents if are desirous for the regularization of their service, they may have a resort to the provisions of the said Act and if they move for the said purpose, their cases shall be decided in accordance with law.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioners filed a constitutional petition seeking enhancement of maintenance allowance, which was partly decreed by the Family Court in Sheikhupura on September 15, 2015. The petitioner No. 1 married the respondent on March 24, 2011, and they had one child, petitioner No. 2. Following differences, the petitioner filed a suit for past and future maintenance at the rate of Rs. 30,000 per head per month. The Family Court decreed the suit partly, granting petitioner No. 1 maintenance only for the period of \"Iddat\" at Rs. 15,000, and for petitioner No. 2 at Rs. 5,000 per month with a 10% annual increase. Dissatisfied with this, the petitioners filed the instant writ petition seeking enhancement of the decreed maintenance. ----Issues: 1- Whether the petitioner (mother) can be deprived of maintenance allowance despite having a suckling baby with her. 2- Whether the maintenance allowance of the minor can be waived by the mother or any blood relative. 3- Whether the maintenance allowance fixed by the Family Court reflects the respondent's financial status and the growing needs of the minor. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Court held that the mother of a suckling baby cannot be deprived of maintenance allowance, emphasizing that the father is responsible for maintaining his child, especially during the period of breastfeeding, which is considered up to 2.5 years under Islamic law. Thus, the mother is entitled to maintenance for this period. The Court ruled that the right to maintenance for the minor cannot be waived by the mother or any blood relative, as it is a right granted by Shariah. The Court noted that the Family Court had not fully considered the respondent's financial capacity and the increased costs of raising the child. The judgment was modified to entitle the mother to maintenance for the period of breastfeeding and acknowledged that the Family Court could reassess and enhance the maintenance allowance as necessary. The Court partly accepted the petition, modifying the Family Court\u2019s judgment and decree to include past maintenance allowance for the mother at the rate of Rs. 5,000 per month from July 24, 2013, to July 13, 2014, with a 10% annual increase. The maintenance allowance for the period of \"Iddat\" and for the minor as decreed by the Family Court was upheld. ----Citations/Precedents: Lt. Col. Nasir Malik vs Additional District Judge Lahore (2016 SCMR 1821): \"Family Court had exclusive jurisdiction relating to maintenance allowance and the matters connected therewith. Once a decree by the Family Court in a suit for maintenance (for minors) was granted, thereafter, if the granted rate for monthly allowance was insufficient and inadequate, in that case, the institution of a fresh suit was not necessary rather the Family Court may entertain any such application (under S.151, C.P.C) and if necessary make alteration in the rate of maintenance allowance.\"",

It is settled by now that the minor could not be burdened with onus to prove the financial status and payment capacity of his father to be held entitled to maintenance allowance rather it was for the father to prove his financial sources which, if he fails to prove, inference is to be drawn against him. The maintenance for past six years could be allowed by the Family Court as a suit for maintenance allowance would be governed by the residuary Article 120 of the Schedule attached to the Limitation Act, 1908 providing limitation of six years. It is settled position of law that the interim maintenance allowance paid during the pendency of the suit in compliance of orders passed by the court is to be adjusted from the amount determined in the final decree.",

Further he is found to have established a liaison for this purpose i.e. sale and purchase with petitioner Gulzar Ahmed whose counsel in his arguments did not deny this fact. But explained that Gulzar Ahmed was a broker and had dealt with him professionally only; had received money from him and then passed on to the party concerned as per business mores.

The court, however, raises questions about the maintainability of the petitions, especially considering that the petitioners voluntarily opted for the Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS) introduced by PTCL.The court discusses the legal aspects, referring to Sections 35 and 36 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996, and the obligations of the federal government as a guarantor. It notes that the petitioners had already received severance pay, separation bonus, and other benefits under the VSS.The court refers to a judgment in a related case and concludes that the petitioners, by opting for the VSS, had no grievance and were not entitled to pension benefits under the Employees' Old-Age Benefits Act. The court dismisses the petitions, stating that the petitioners failed to make a case, and the applications are dismissed with no order as to costs.",

However, Jalal Shah also had a daughter, Mst. Ghulam Fatima, who passed away before him. Mst. Ghulam Fatima's three daughters, namely Ummat-ul-Aziz, Akhtar Bibi, and Safdar Bibi, invoked the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, to claim their share in the estate. Ummat-ul-Aziz filed an application in 2008 to correct the inheritance mutation, which was initially disallowed. In 2012, she filed a suit seeking cancellation of the mutation and a declaration of her entitlement to her share in the estate. However, the suit faced several challenges, including issues of limitation and the question of her awareness of her rights. Meanwhile, Mushtaq Ali Shah and Said Ali Shah's legal heirs sold their respective shares in the inherited land to a third party, Misbah-ul-Hassan. Said Ali Shah's legal heirs sold their share to Syed Kausar Ali Shah, who later sold the land, along with his inherited portion, to Taqi Developers (Pvt.) Limited in 2007. The petitioners argued that Ummat-ul-Aziz's claim was time-barred due to the delay in asserting her rights. They also emphasized that third-party interests had been created in the land, and Taqi Developers (Pvt.) Limited had acted in good faith when purchasing the property. The court analyzed the facts and relevant legal principles, including the doctrine of acquiescence and the significance of third-party interests. It concluded that Ummat-ul-Aziz had allowed the creation of third-party interests without challenging the property records for forty-five years. As a result, the court dismissed the suit, setting aside the previous judgments.",

The respondent uncles allegedly prepared a gift document, showing that Ahmad had gifted his entire land to them, thereby attempting to deprive the appellant of her rightful share in the estate.The appellant filed a suit in 1997, seeking cancellation of the gift deed and gift mutation and claiming her inheritance in her grandfather's estate. The High Court had previously set aside the judgment of the Appellate Court, dismissing the appellant's suit, leading to this appeal.The court examined the essential elements of a valid gift under Muslim law: a declaration of gift, acceptance of the gift, and delivery of possession of the subject of the gift. It was argued that the gift was not accepted by the donees (respondents) as required for a valid gift. The court analyzed the evidence and testimonies and found that the gift had not been accepted by the respondents.Furthermore, the court addressed the argument that Section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance was no longer applicable due to a decision by the Federal Shariat Court. However, the court clarified that the case challenging the validity of Section 4 was still pending before the Shariat Appellate Bench, and until a final decision is reached, Section 4 remains the subsistent law of Pakistan.Ultimately, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the High Court's judgment, and restored the judgment of the Appellate Court, which recognized the appellant's right to inheritance in her grandfather's estate. No costs were awarded in the case. The judgment was delivered on 27th January 2022.",

The Respondents claimed that they were equal parties to the property and that a family settlement had been reached. According to the Respondents, an award was made, and the settlement was handed over to the Patwari for incorporation into the Revenue Record. However, the Petitioners alleged that an impugned mutation was sanctioned, transferring the property to them, despite the existence of the family settlement. The main issues before the Supreme Court were: Whether the family settlement was proven and its effect.Whether the impugned mutation could be sanctioned. Regarding the impugned mutation, the High Court found that the Patwari did not fulfill his duty in accordance with the law. The Petitioners' attorney and an attesting witness testified that the settlement and award were handed over to the Patwari, but he improperly obtained signatures on a blank form and sanctioned the mutation. The High Court concluded that the Patwari's actions were tainted with mala fide. Based on these findings, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, ruling in favor of the Respondents. The Court affirmed the validity of the family settlement and determined that the impugned mutation was improperly sanctioned.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner in this case has challenged the order issued by the learned Judge Family Court, Gujranwala, and the judgment issued by the learned Additional District Judge, Gujranwala. The petitioner was married to respondent No.3 on 31.12.2005, with a dower of 32.25 tola gold ornaments, which was later taken back by respondent No.3. Additionally, the petitioner received dowry articles worth Rs.13,91,000 from her parents. Due to conflicts between the parties, the petitioner filed for dissolution of marriage, recovery of dower, dowry articles, and maintenance. The Family Court decreed the dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula under Section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. However, the petitioner contested that the grounds for dissolution, namely failure to pay maintenance and cruel behavior, fall under Section 2(ii) and (viii)(a) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, which does not allow dissolution based on Khula. Legal precedents cited include the case of Sardar Abid Iqbal vs. Tabassam Khursheed (2009 YLR 1745) and Mst. Saima Irum vs. Tariq Javed (2005 S.L.R. 655), emphasizing that the court cannot pass a decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula unless specifically requested by the wife. The court must ensure that the wife voluntarily surrenders her right to dower. The court highlighted the difference between Talaq and Khula, stating that Khula is initiated by the wife and requires her to forego certain rights, whereas Talaq is initiated by the husband and entails paying the dower to the wife. In conclusion, the court found that neither the petitioner intended nor requested dissolution based on Khula, and therefore, the orders issued by the Family Court and the Additional District Judge were without jurisdiction. The petitioner's case for dower will continue before the Family Court, allowing respondent No.3 to present their defense. Consequently, the petition was allowed, and a decree for dissolution of marriage was granted in favor of the petitioner, based on other grounds justifying dissolution.",

Rehana Shamas (the respondent), as per their nikahnama. The respondent filed a suit seeking recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, dowry articles, and dissolution of marriage. The family court decreed in favor of the respondent, which was upheld by the appellate court. The petitioner challenged the judgments primarily regarding the grant of dower, arguing that the transfer of a house mentioned in the nikahnama constituted deferred dower and shouldn't be paid during the marriage. The petitioner's counsel argued that the marriage's terms related to the transfer of the house were deferred dower, citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court in Saadia Usman v. Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel referred to the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, contending that the dower was on demand, obligating the petitioner to hand over the house or its value. The case examined various columns of the nikahnama and Section 10 of the Ordinance to determine the nature of the dower. Dower in Islam can be specified or unspecified, prompt, or deferred, with no upper limit set. The Supreme Court's precedent emphasized the importance of clarity in defining prompt and deferred dower in the nikahnama. Saadia Usman v. Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon (2009): This case established principles regarding deferred dower and the necessity for clarity in defining the nature of dower in the nikahnama. Mst. Yasmeen Bibi v. Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan and others (2016): This case highlighted that entries in various columns of the nikahnama are part of undertakings related to dower, emphasizing clarity in defining dower in the nikahnama. Syed Sajjad Hussain v. Judge Family Court etc. (2019): This case discussed the waiver of entitlement to deferred dower through consent or conduct. State Bank of Pakistan through Governor & another v. Imtiaz Ali Khan & others (2012): This case emphasized the doctrine of laches in legal matters. Ghulam Hussain Ramzan Ali v. Collector of Customs (Preventive), Karachi (2014): This case further discussed the doctrine of laches in legal proceedings. The court ruled that since the nikahnama didn't specify the mode or time of payment for the house mentioned under column No. 16, it constituted deferred dower, and the respondent was entitled to claim it. The petitioner's contradictory statements and the delay in filing the petition led to its dismissal on grounds of laches.",

The incident escalated from a wrestling match between the appellant and the complainant, who were siblings involved in a longstanding family feud over land. The appellant allegedly entered the complainant's house and struck the child with an iron blow pipe, resulting in her death. During the trial, the prosecution presented two eyewitnesses, both brothers of the complainant, to support the charges against the appellant. However, critical inconsistencies and gaps in the prosecution's case emerged: The delay in reporting the incident to the police, the absence of spot recovery, and the lack of blood evidence at the crime scene raised doubts about the credibility of the prosecution's case. The medical evidence presented during the trial contradicted the prosecution's narrative. The autopsy report indicated injuries inconsistent with the alleged weapon used by the appellant, suggesting the possibility of the child's injuries resulting from a fall rather than a deliberate attack. The prosecution failed to establish a clear motive for the appellant's alleged actions, and essential witnesses, including the child's mother, were not produced in court. In light of these inconsistencies and shortcomings in the prosecution's case, the court ruled in favor of the appellant. The appellant's conviction and sentence were overturned, and she was acquitted of all charges.",

Even the testimony of injured witness is to be subject to scrutiny, for making it basis of conviction.-----In the case of Nasir Abbas and Muhammad Saleem, they were tried for offenses including murder, attempted murder, and other charges. The trial court convicted Nasir Abbas of murder and sentenced him to death, along with other sentences, while Muhammad Saleem was sentenced to life imprisonment and other terms. The appellants filed an appeal against these convictions. The prosecution's case was based on the eyewitness accounts of the complainant and other witnesses who claimed that the appellants shot and killed Manazir Ali and injured Muhammad Ijaz due to a family dispute related to an engagement. However, the court highlighted several inconsistencies and weaknesses in the prosecution's case. The court noted a significant delay in reporting the incident to the police, raising doubts about the veracity of the prosecution's version. It also pointed out discrepancies in the statements of the eyewitnesses regarding the details of their travel and the purchases they made. The court questioned the reliability of identifying the accused solely based on the headlights of the cars during a night occurrence and emphasized the lack of possession of the car used by the witnesses at the time of the incident. Medical evidence, particularly the absence of burning and blackening on the deceased's body, contradicted the eyewitness accounts. The court concluded that the prosecution failed to establish a motive for the crime, as the family relationship and engagement mentioned were not adequately supported by evidence. Considering the inconsistencies in the ocular and medical evidence, doubts about the motive, and lack of corroboration, the court acquitted both appellants, setting aside their convictions and sentences. The court also declined to confirm the death sentence for Nasir Abbas, and both appellants were ordered to be released if not required in any other case.",

This order closed the petitioner's right to submit a written statement in response to a suit filed by respondents No. 2 to 5, who are the petitioner's wife, daughter, and sons, respectively, seeking maintenance, dower, and dowry articles. The petitioner had previously filed an application to set aside the ex parte proceedings, which was accepted subject to payment of costs and filing of a written statement. However, despite several opportunities given by the court, the petitioner failed to comply with the order to submit the written statement and pay the costs. The petitioner argued that the closure of his right to file a written statement was illegal as there is no provision in the Family Courts Act, 1964, empowering the Family Court to pass such an order. However, the court examined the conduct of the petitioner and noted persistent defaults in complying with court orders. The court cited Manzoor Elahi vs. Zulaikhan Bibi and another (PLD 2009 Islamabad 4), Kh. Muhammad Ahmad Qasim vs. Mst. Kaneez Fatima and another (2006 MLD 1128), Fakhar Abbas vs. Additional District Judge Tandlianwala, District Faisalabad and 3 others (2017 CLC Note 22), Khalil-ur-Rehman Bhutta vs. Razia and another (1984 CLC 890). It noted that the purpose of the legislation was to expedite litigation, especially in family matters, to prevent disruption in the social lives of families. Furthermore, the court cited legal precedents indicating that the Family Court has the authority to pass punitive orders against defaulting litigants to ensure the orderly dispensation of justice.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh's judgment pertains to two connected writ petitions (W.P. Nos. 6694/2021 and 30995/2021) regarding the aftermath of Sarfraz Hussain's marriage to Respondent No.2 and the subsequent birth of Respondent No.3. Following their divorce, legal proceedings determined alimony, dowry, and maintenance for Respondent No.2 and Respondent No.3, with subsequent appeals modifying these amounts. The judgment extensively refers to Islamic law, emphasizing the obligation of maintenance for family members. It cites verses from Surah Al-Baqara and Surah An-Nisaa, along with traditions of the Holy Prophet. The obligation to maintain wives and children is discussed, including conditions related to faithfulness and obedience. The duty of a father to maintain children, as outlined in Section 370 of the Principles of Mahomedan Law by D.F. Mulla, is explored. Various legal precedents, such as Iqbal Hussain v. Deputy Commissioner/Collector, Lahore [PLD 1960 SC 883], and Haji Nizam Khan v. Additional District Judge, Lyallpur [PLD 1969 SC 50], support the principles of maintenance. The judgment underscores the importance of fair trial and due process, as enshrined in Article 10A of the Constitution of Pakistan. It highlights the significance of notice and an opportunity to be heard before judgment, emphasizing that a decree cannot be executed against a person who was not a party to the suit. The court also stresses the need for factual determination regarding the liability of a grandfather to provide maintenance for grandchildren. Legal precedents, including Muhammad Ramzan v. Ali Hamza [2016 SCMR 1121] and Muhammad Yaqoob v. Additional District Judge, Kharian [2015 SCMR 1403], further support these principles. The judgment scrutinizes and challenges previous decisions, such as Muhammad Ali v. Abdul Sattar [PLD 1970 SC 269], Sultan Ahmad v. Judge Family Court [2015 MLD 1927], and Mst. Haleema Bibi v. Additional District Judge, Layyah [2003 CLC 561], asserting their inconsistency with Article 10A of the Constitution. When the decree remained unsatisfied, the Family Court issued a warrant for the arrest of the Petitioner, Respondent No.3's grandfather, prompting the filing of writ petitions challenging the legality of the orders.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner in the case brought before the court alleged that the judgment and decree were issued without the respondent's consent and without sufficient opportunity for reconciliation. The petitioner expressed willingness to reconcile for the sake of their children. The court noted the timeline of events, indicating several opportunities for reconciliation proceedings, which the petitioner failed to fully engage in. The court emphasized the importance of reconciliation but ultimately granted the dissolution of marriage based on Khula due to the irreconcilable differences between the spouses. It referenced Islamic law and previous court decisions to support its decision. Khurshid Bibi Vs Muhammad Amin (PLD 1967 SC 97): This case was cited to highlight the interpretation of Islamic law regarding marriage dissolution, particularly the wife's right to seek Khula under certain circumstances. The court emphasized that Islam allows for the separation of spouses if they cannot live together harmoniously. Abid Hussain Vs Additional District Judge, Alipur, District Muzaffargarh (2006 SCMR 100): This case was referenced to illustrate the purpose behind the non-appealable nature of decrees issued by family courts, emphasizing the protection of women from prolonged and costly litigation. Nawab Syed Raunaq Ali, etc. Vs Chief Settlement Commissioner and others (PLD 1973 SC 236): This case laid down principles regarding the discretionary nature of writ jurisdiction, emphasizing the need to demonstrate injustice caused by the impugned order before invoking the court's discretionary powers. Balqis Fatima\u00eds case and Umar Bibi and Sayeeda Khanam: The court referred to these cases to discuss historical interpretations of Islamic law regarding Khula and the role of the Qazi in granting separation between spouses. These legal precedents were invoked to justify the court's decision and demonstrate the legal basis for granting the dissolution of marriage based on Khula in the case at hand. The court highlighted that the decree for Khula was non-appealable according to the Family Court Act, emphasizing the protection of women from prolonged litigation. Finally, the court dismissed the petition, stating that there was no legal basis for interference in the judgment and decree.",

The Family Court granted maintenance for the children but rejected the claims for dower and maintenance. Naheed Begum appealed to the District Court, which upheld the Family Court's decision. She then approached the Peshawar High Court, which allowed her petition, reversed the lower courts' judgments, and decreed her claims for dower and maintenance. The petitioner, Haseen Ullah, filed a petition for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court against the High Court's judgment. The Supreme Court heard arguments from both parties and reviewed the case record. The main point of contention was the interpretation of the entries in columns No. 13 to 16 of the Nikahnama (marriage contract). The Family Court and District Court interpreted the columns to mean that the dower mentioned in column No. 16 was payable only if the dower specified in column No. 13 had not been paid. As Naheed Begum admitted to receiving the dower of seven tola gold ornaments specified in column No. 13, the lower courts concluded that she was not entitled to the dower mentioned in column No. 16. The High Court, however, held that the dower mentioned in column No. 16 was in addition to, not in lieu of, the one specified in column No. 13. The High Court considered the intent of the parties based on the figures mentioned in both columns and the contents of a compromise deed executed by the parties. The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's interpretation, stating that the figures in the columns clearly indicated that both the gold ornaments and the four Kanal agriculture land mentioned in column No. 16 were part of the dower. Regarding the claim for maintenance, the lower courts held that Naheed Begum was not entitled to maintenance because she was not residing with the petitioner. However, the High Court overturned this decision, stating that if a wife is willing to fulfill her marital obligations but cannot do so due to her husband's actions, she is entitled to maintenance. The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision, citing the husband's duty to maintain his wife under Islamic law. The judgment emphasizes that dower is an integral part of Muslim marriages, with the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad emphasizing the husband's obligation to pay it to the bride. The judgment affirms the wife's right to maintenance as long as she remains faithful and willing to fulfill her matrimonial obligations. In conclusion, the Supreme Court affirmed the High Court's judgment, upholding Naheed Begum's entitlement to both dower and maintenance from her husband.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and dowry articles was partly decreed by the Lahore Family Court and partially allowed by the High Court in December 2020. The respondents filed an execution petition transferred to Faisalabad due to the petitioner's residence there. The petitioner objected to the transfer, contending violations of the Family Courts Act. The petitioner argued that the impugned decisions overlooked key provisions of the Family Courts Act, specifically Sections 17 and 25-A, which empower High Courts and District Courts to transfer suits and proceedings. They argue that the Family Court's jurisdiction does not extend to transferring cases outside its district. The petitioner cites legal precedents to support their argument. The respondents argue that the transfer was valid under Section 13(3) of the Family Courts Act and Section 39 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC). They contend that the executing court's jurisdiction is not restricted by district boundaries. Wazir Laiq v. The State and others (PLD 1987 Supreme Court 35), Muhammad Farash Khan v. Mst.

They provide context and precedent for the legal issues at hand in the case being discussed. After considering arguments and legal provisions, the court concludes that the transfer was invalid and directs the executing court to proceed with the decree's satisfaction according to law. The judgment emphasizes the applicability of Section 25-A of the Family Courts Act and the limitations on the Family Court's transfer powers.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [Scope and extent of the first proviso to section 497(1) Crpc. There is no offence falling under the prohibitory clause for a woman seeking post arrest bail] Bail After Arrest. The allegations in the crime report stated that five unknown individuals entered the complainant's house, held the complainant, his family, and their maid (allegedly, the petitioner) forcibly, and robbed them of cash, jewelry, and mobiles. The complainant later implicated the petitioner as an accomplice of the robbers.The petitioner sought leave to appeal, and her counsel argued that the maid mentioned in the crime report was named Sidra, and there was no evidence to prove that the petitioner was the maid. Furthermore, the petitioner's counsel asserted that being a woman, she was entitled to bail. On the other hand, the prosecution argued that the petitioner was involved with the co-accused in the robbery and that stolen items were recovered from her.The Supreme Court examined Section 497(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and its first proviso. It was clarified that the first proviso extends the power of the Court to grant bail in cases of non-bailable offenses to accused persons under the age of sixteen, women, and sick or infirm persons. This means that bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception for such individuals, similar to non-bailable offenses not falling under the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC.After examining the record, the Court found no material to justify refusing bail to the petitioner based on exceptions such as absconding, tampering with evidence, or repeating the offense. The Court observed that the petitioner, being a maid in the complainant's house, did not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit, and there was no likelihood of her repeating the offense if granted bail.As a result, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court's order, and granted post-arrest bail to the petitioner.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Under section 13(3) of the Family Court Act, 1964, the special procedure prescribed under Land Revenue Act, 1967 can be followed by the family Court through a specific order and in absence of such order, the ordinary mode for execution prescribed under CPC shall be applicable.----The respondents filed a suit against the petitioner for recovery of maintenance allowance and dowry articles. The petitioner argued that the civil imprisonment exceeding seven months was illegal as it contravened section 13(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. They contended that the recovery of the decretal amount should have been pursued as arrears of land revenue under section 13(3), which limits civil imprisonment to 30 days. However, the respondents' counsel argued that since no specific order was issued to follow the procedure under the Land Revenue Act, civil imprisonment could extend up to one year under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court ruled that under section 13 of the Act, the Family Court has discretion to recover the decretal amount as arrears of land revenue but may also follow the procedures outlined in the CPC. It noted that civil imprisonment for failure to pay the decretal amount could extend up to one year under the CPC. Since no specific order was issued to follow the procedure under the Land Revenue Act, the court held that the petitioner's detention for more than one month was not illegal or against the provisions of section 13(3) of the Act. Therefore, the petition was dismissed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case alleges corruption and corrupt practices against Shahbaz Sharif and his family members. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) claims that Shahbaz Sharif and his associates acquired assets disproportionate to their known sources of income through fictitious transactions and money laundering. The dissenting judges identified three points of disagreement:a) Whether Shahbaz Sharif is entitled to post-arrest bail concerning the allegations of assets beyond means and money laundering.b) Whether Shahbaz Sharif is entitled to post-arrest bail on medical grounds.c) Whether Shahbaz Sharif is entitled to post-arrest bail due to delays in concluding the trial.The case presents extensive evidence regarding alleged financial irregularities, including suspicious transactions, disproportionate assets, and involvement in money laundering schemes. Various legal precedents and principles related to corruption, benami transactions, and burden of proof are cited throughout the summary. The judges ultimately grant Shahbaz Sharif post-arrest bail, noting the absence of direct evidence linking him to the alleged crimes and the possibility of acquittal. They emphasize the presumption of innocence and the need for concrete evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The decision is made despite dissenting opinions, citing legal precedent and the need for fairness in the judicial process. PLD 2002 SC 546, Ch. Zulfiqar Ali versus The State: This case likely deals with legal principles related to bail or criminal proceedings and may provide guidance on similar matters.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The instant petition arises from a legal dispute wherein respondent No.1, along with her minor child (respondent No.2), filed a suit for dissolution of marriage, recovery of maintenance allowance, delivery expenses, and recovery of dowry articles against the petitioner. The petitioner contested the suit through a written statement and subsequently sought permission to submit receipts of dowry articles, which was dismissed. Another application for permission to produce the same receipts and to file an amended schedule of witnesses was also dismissed. The main arguments of the petitioner's counsel were centered around the contention that the documents should have been allowed in the interest of justice, notwithstanding the procedural requirements.The court considered the timeline of events, noting that the trial had been ongoing for approximately five and a half years without conclusion. The petitioner's applications for permission to produce documents were made belatedly, after the conclusion of oral evidence. The court observed that the petitioner failed to provide sufficient reasons for the delay and the relevance of the documents. Furthermore, the nature of the documents (receipts) was vague and unspecific, with no clear relevance to the claims made by respondent No.1. In the judgment, the court emphasized that the discretion of the Family Court to allow the production of documents is subject to certain conditions, including the relevance, materiality, and timing of the documents. The court found that the orders of the Family Court rejecting the petitioner's applications were justified based on the facts and circumstances of the case. Therefore, the Constitutional petition was dismissed as lacking merit and substance, with the court finding no error of law or jurisdiction in the orders of the Family Court.",

The marriage between the petitioner and respondent No.3 occurred in 2004, resulting in the birth of respondents No.4 to 8. Respondents No.3 to 8 filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance allowance, dower, and dowry articles against the petitioner, which was partially decreed by the trial court. The petitioner's appeal was also dismissed by the appellate court, leading to this writ petition. The petitioner's counsel argued at length, emphasizing the evidence presented during the trial. Respondent No.3 herself appeared as a witness and provided her statement, corroborated by Muhammad Aslam, while the petitioner admitted to the marriage and the birth of four sons and one daughter. The main point of contention revolves around the quantum of dower amount. The marriage was solemnized orally, and no written Nikahnama was produced. The determination of proper dower (Mehr-Misl) is discussed in light of Islamic jurisprudence, emphasizing the wife's entitlement to receive reasonably appropriate dower. Legal precedents such as Mst. Manzoor Elahi Vs Muhammad Nawaz & Others (2002 MLD 988) and Zulfiqar Ali Vs. Judge, Family Court & 7 Others (2007 MLD 1710) are cited. The petitioner's counsel failed to identify any illegality, material irregularity, or jurisdictional defect in the judgments of the lower courts. The concurrent findings of fact are deemed against the petitioner, warranting no interference by this Court. Consequently, the writ petition was dismissed in limine for being misconceived and devoid of merit.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Where the wife had filed the suit for recovery of her dowry articles against her husband and his close relatives by stating that her dowry articles were in their possession and use, the said relatives were necessary parties for proper decision of the case and their application for deletion of their names from array of defendants was rightly dismissed by the family court.----The petitioners have filed a petition seeking to overturn an order issued by the Family Court, Rahim Yar Khan. The order denied the petitioners' request to be removed from the list of defendants in a family suit for the recovery of dowry items brought by respondent No.2 against her husband (respondent No.3) and the petitioners (who are the brother, mother, and sister-in-law of respondent No.3). The petitioners argued that they were improperly included as defendants in the suit, contending that only respondent No.3 should have been sued. However, the court determined that the petitioners were necessary parties for a proper resolution of the dispute under Section 2(d) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. This section defines a party as any person whose presence is deemed necessary for a proper decision. The court cited legal precedents, including the case of Wajid Abbasi v. Tahira Jamil (2013 MLD 755), to justify its decision. In this case, the court refused to add a defendant where dissolution of marriage wasn't sought against them, which the court deemed distinguishable from the present case. Furthermore, the court emphasized the importance of fair trial and due process, citing the case of Babar Hussain Shah v. Mujeeb Ahmed Khan(2012 SCMR 1235). It stressed that orders violating due process may be considered void, highlighting the significance of providing fair trial rights to all parties. Ultimately, the court found no legal grounds to interfere with the lower court's decision, dismissing the petition. However, it instructed the trial court to proceed with the case independently, unaffected by any observations made in the dismissal order.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case involves a dispute between a petitioner and respondent No.1 regarding the delivery of 5 tolas of gold ornaments promised at the time of marriage. The petitioner filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance allowance, gold ornaments, and dowry articles, which was partially decreed by the Family Court. The respondent was ordered to deliver the gold ornaments or pay Rs. 2,50,000 as their price. During execution proceedings, the respondent expressed willingness to pay the price instead of delivering the ornaments, leading to a legal challenge. The Executing Court initially directed the respondent to pay the market value of the gold ornaments, considering prevailing legal principles. However, the decision was reversed by the Additional District Judge, who argued that the decree fixed the price, and the respondent could satisfy it by paying Rs. 2,50,000. Upon review, the court found that the decree was not merely a money decree but specifically aimed at recovering 5 tolas of gold ornaments. The petitioner was entitled to either the ornaments or their current market value, as per established legal precedents. The respondent's delay and refusal to deliver the ornaments were deemed unfair, and the court upheld the Executing Court's decision to seek the market rate of gold to enable the petitioner to obtain the ornaments. The judgment ultimately allowed the writ petition, declaring the Additional District Judge's order unlawful and restoring the Executing Court's decision. The judgment refers to several legal precedents to support its decision, including: Mst. Humaira Majeed v. Habib Ahmad: Emphasized the importance of delivering gold ornaments or their market value to the decree-holder. Mst. Ayesha Shaheen v. Khalid Mehmood: Established the right of the wife to recover gold ornaments or their market value.Haji Muhammad Nawaz v. Samina Kanwal: Highlighted the court's authority to enforce the execution of a decree regarding dowry articles. These precedents informed the court's decision to uphold the petitioner's right to receive the promised gold ornaments or their equivalent market value.",

The petitioner's counsel asserted that the judgment of the Family Court was well-reasoned and supported by evidence. The Addl. District Judge's judgment ignored key factors and relied on questionable comparisons of signatures without considering expert opinions. The judgment lacked legal basis and jurisdictional soundness.

Binding effect of an offer of special oath, if accepted by the other party] The petitioner, Sajid Mehmood, appealed against the dismissal of his suit for recovery of dower, dowry The petitioner had voluntarily offered to take a special oath regarding the dowry articles and the allegation that he had sold the gold ornaments. The respondent accepted the offer and took a special oath affirming the details of the dowry articles and the sale of gold ornaments. The Family Court decided the suit in favor of the respondent based on the special oath. The petitioner appealed the decision, arguing that the case should have been decided on its merits rather than relying on the special oath. The petitioner's counsel contended that the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (QSO 1984) was not applicable to Family Court proceedings under Section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. However, it was acknowledged that the petitioner himself had filed the application for a special oath. The court examined the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873, which allowed parties in litigation to offer each other to accept or reject a claim on a special oath. The court concluded that once an offer to be bound by a special oath was accepted, a binding agreement was formed, and the party making the offer had no right to withdraw from it. The court emphasized that the Oaths Act should not give unfair advantage to either party. Therefore, the Family Court was obligated to implement the agreement and make a decision based on the special oath. The court referred to previous judgments that upheld decisions based on special oaths under the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873. It stated that the special oath in the present case was not covered by Article 163 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat (Law of Evidence), and the alleged violation of any prescribed procedure was unfounded. Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the civil petition and refused to grant leave. The judgment of the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench was upheld.",

The petitioner filed an application under Order IX, Rule 13 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) to set aside the ex-parte decree, claiming that he was informed by the respondent that the suit had been withdrawn, which led him to believe there was no need to appear in the proceedings. The trial court dismissed the application, as did the first appellate court. The petitioner then filed a revision application under Section 115 CPC before the High Court, seeking to revise the concurrent findings of the lower courts. However, since the petitioner failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional defect or material irregularity, the High Court declined the revision. The petitioner now appeals to the Supreme Court, arguing that his grounds for setting aside the ex-parte decree were not properly appreciated, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. The petitioner claims that he was under the impression that a compromise had been reached between the parties and the suit had been withdrawn. After examining the petitioner's application, the Supreme Court finds that the petitioner's claim lacks merit. The petitioner failed to provide any evidence of a compromise or details of its terms and conditions. Furthermore, the petitioner did not indicate that he had informed his counsel about the alleged compromise or instructed them not to appear in court. The court concludes that the petitioner deliberately chose not to participate in the proceedings and showed non-cooperation with the court. As a result, the court denies the petitioner's request to set aside the ex-parte decree. The Supreme Court dismisses the petition, stating that the petitioner has failed to establish a case for the grant of leave to appeal.",

Binding effect of an offer of special oath, if accepted by the other party] The petitioner, Sajid Mehmood, appealed against the dismissal of his suit for recovery of dower, dowry The petitioner had voluntarily offered to take a special oath regarding the dowry articles and the allegation that he had sold the gold ornaments. The respondent accepted the offer and took a special oath affirming the details of the dowry articles and the sale of gold ornaments. The Family Court decided the suit in favor of the respondent based on the special oath. The petitioner appealed the decision, arguing that the case should have been decided on its merits rather than relying on the special oath. The petitioner's counsel contended that the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (QSO 1984) was not applicable to Family Court proceedings under Section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. However, it was acknowledged that the petitioner himself had filed the application for a special oath. The court examined the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873, which allowed parties in litigation to offer each other to accept or reject a claim on a special oath. The court concluded that once an offer to be bound by a special oath was accepted, a binding agreement was formed, and the party making the offer had no right to withdraw from it. The court emphasized that the Oaths Act should not give unfair advantage to either party. Therefore, the Family Court was obligated to implement the agreement and make a decision based on the special oath. The court referred to previous judgments that upheld decisions based on special oaths under the provisions of the Oaths Act, 1873. It stated that the special oath in the present case was not covered by Article 163 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat (Law of Evidence), and the alleged violation of any prescribed procedure was unfounded. Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the civil petition and refused to grant leave. The judgment of the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench was upheld.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The dispute revolved around the transferability of plot No. 12-H/2, G-8 Markaz, Islamabad, which the CDA claimed was a non-transferable plot restricted to the family of the original allottee. The CDA argued that the High Court failed to consider the relevant provisions of the allotment letter and lease agreement. They contended that certain plots, including the disputed plot, reserved for social welfare projects like clinics, could not be transferred except in exceptional cases. On the other hand, the respondent, Ahmed Murtaza, filed a suit for specific performance of a contract for the sale of the disputed plot. The suit was decided in his favor through a consent decree, and the plot was transferred to him. The CDA challenged the judgment and decree, leading to a series of legal proceedings and appeals. The Supreme Court examined the facts of the case and found that the CDA had previously transferred the disputed plot to various individuals outside the family members, despite its claim of non-transferability. The court also noted that the CDA did not disclose these facts in its petition and deliberately neglected to mention the orders related to the objection petition and the civil petition filed before the Supreme Court. The court emphasized that the CDA had already challenged the transfer in a previous case, which was decided against them, and subsequently withdrew their petition. The court concluded that the matter had been decided on its merits in a previous case, and the CDA was bound by the findings of that case. The court criticized the CDA for pursuing frivolous litigation, wasting the time of the court and the respondents. It noted that the CDA had transferred the plot to non-family members multiple times without raising any objections, but chose to dispute the transfer to the respondents. The court denounced this behavior and emphasized the need for institutions like the CDA to take responsibility for their actions and decisions. In light of these findings, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition and imposed special costs on the CDA for their conduct in pursuing meritless litigation. The court expressed its concern over the wasted time and resources caused by such actions and emphasized the importance of acting in good faith and disclosing relevant facts in legal proceedings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Dismissal of objection petition seeking cancellation of warrants of arrest issued against the attorney amounts to a final appealable order in terms of section 14 of the Family Courts Act 1964---The petitioner, who was the brother and attorney of the judgment debtor, challenged the orders, which resulted in warrants of arrest being issued against him. The petitioner argued that as he was neither the judgment debtor nor stood as surety or guarantor for him, the issuance of warrants of arrest against him was unjustified. The court observed that the impugned orders were not mere issuance of warrants but amounted to a final decision by the executing court, citing a Supreme Court judgment and precedent. Consequently, the court ruled that the orders were appealable before the appellate court under Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. Specifically, the judge cited a Supreme Court judgment reported as Muhammad Pervez vs. Mst. Nabila Yasmeen and 2 others (2004 SCMR 1352) as well as a judgment reported as Rahim Bukhsh vs. Mst. Shehzadi and others (2018 CLC 1789). These precedents were used to establish that the orders issued by the executing court amounted to final decisions and were therefore appealable before the appellate court under Section 14 of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The judge also noted that the dismissal of an objection petition, as in the petitioner's case, was considered an appealable order, as per legal precedent.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner raised a contention that there was a defect in the filing of the suit because the minor daughter, Mst. Dua, was not included as a plaintiff. The petitioner argued that due to this defect, the trial court did not have the authority to grant a decree in favor of the minor daughter. However, this defect was not addressed by the lower courts. Before addressing the specific proposition, the judges highlighted the long-term effects of family litigation on the emotional health of the children involved. They emphasized the need for a child-rights-driven approach and a facilitative response from the judicial system when dealing with children. The judges noted that the Family Courts Act, 1964 grants the Family Court ample powers to devise its own procedures, with the objective of expeditious disposal of family matters. Regarding the inclusion of Mst. Dua as a plaintiff, the judges acknowledged that while her name was not mentioned in the array of plaintiffs independently, her case for maintenance was clearly pleaded in the body of the plaint and specific maintenance allowance for her was sought in the prayer clause by the petitioner-respondent No. 1, who is her mother. The judges highlighted that the technicalities and trappings of normal practice and procedure are not always suitable for cases involving very young children. They emphasized that procedural convenience should be resolved in favor of women and children, subject to the command of the statute. After reviewing the record, the judges found that the petitioner failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional defect committed by the lower courts. As a result, the writ petition was dismissed, and the petitioner sought leave to appeal against the High Court's order. However, the petitioner's counsel also failed to show any defect in the High Court's judgment, and thus, the judges refused to grant leave to appeal. In the concluding remarks, the judges noted that the right of appeal is created by the statute, and the Family Courts Act, 1964 does not provide for the right of second appeal to any party. They expressed regret over the routine exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction by the High Courts under Article 199 of the Constitution as a substitute for appeal or revision, which compromises the expeditious disposal of cases. They suggested that the High Courts should prioritize the disposal of family cases by constituting special family benches.",

Writ jurisdiction could not be exercised to bypass the remedy of appeal which is also against the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies] The petitioner, Sana Jamali, filed a suit in the Family Court seeking dissolution of her marriage, maintenance for herself and her two minor daughters, and retrieval of dowry articles. The respondent, Mujeeb Qamar, failed to appear in court and was declared ex-parte. The Family Court granted the petitioner's request and dissolved the marriage. However, the respondent filed an application in the Family Court seeking to set aside the judgment and decree. The application was dismissed, and the respondent filed a Constitution Petition in the High Court, which set aside the ex-parte judgment and remanded the case back to the Family Court. The petitioner argued that the Constitution Petition was not maintainable and that the remand was unjustified. The respondent claimed that he was not served with the notice or summons and had no knowledge of the suit. The Supreme Court examined the issue of substituted service and found that the Family Court failed to follow the procedure for it. The Court also noted that the Constitution Petition should have been filed before the District Court, not directly in the High Court. Ultimately, the Supreme Court rejected the office objection regarding the timeliness of the petition and ruled in favor of the petitioner, setting aside the High Court's judgment and remanding the case back to the Family Court.",

While claiming conjugal rights by a husband in response to the suit for dissolution of marriage, dower, dowry and maintenance, it is also an onerous responsibility of the Court to see whether he is sincerely fulfilling his obligations towards his wife] The petitioners argue that the lower courts misread and failed to consider the evidence of cruelty presented by petitioner No.1. They claim that respondent No.1's behavior and attitude caused hatred and resentment in petitioner No.1's mind, justifying the dissolution of the marriage. The petitioners argue that the Family Court made a correct judgment based on the evidence, but the Appellate Court unjustifiably modified the decision. The respondent's counsel rebuts these arguments, claiming that the Family Court failed to properly consider the evidence and that the Appellate Court rightly modified the judgment. They also assert that petitioner No.1 voluntarily left the respondent's house and expressed a desire not to rejoin him. The summary emphasizes the importance of properly evaluating evidence in cases of cruelty and highlights the burden of proof on the party making the claim. It mentions relevant legal provisions and references various legal sources to define and understand the concept of cruelty. The summary concludes by stating that the High Court should exercise its jurisdiction to correct any errors or violations of law or evidence committed by the lower courts.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (Dismissed) Nasir Ahmed, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by the trial court. The Lahore High Court upheld the conviction and sentence. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court. According to the prosecution, the petitioner, along with other accused individuals, committed the murder of Mst. Shehnaz Bibi and caused injuries to Bushra Bibi. The incident occurred during a wedding ceremony, where the petitioner allegedly fired shots at Mst. Shehnaz Bibi, resulting in her death, and injured Bushra Bibi. The motive behind the crime was said to be the petitioner's disapproval of the marriage. The Supreme Court analyzed the evidence presented in the case, including the statements of eyewitnesses, medical evidence, and the alleged motive. The court found the ocular account provided by the prosecution witnesses to be reliable and consistent. The witnesses testified to the circumstances of the crime, and their testimonies were not successfully challenged during cross-examination. The court also noted that the medical evidence supported the ocular account and that minor discrepancies between the two did not undermine the prosecution's case. The court emphasized that reliable ocular testimony alone can be sufficient to sustain a conviction, even without further corroboration. Regarding the alleged motive, the court found that the prosecution successfully proved it, as the witnesses testified to the petitioner's disapproval of the marriage and the involvement of the complainant's family. The court highlighted that the defense did not adequately challenge this aspect of the case during cross-examination. Although the recovery of the weapon used in the crime was inconsequential due to the lack of crime empty collected from the scene, the court determined that there was ample evidence, including the ocular account, medical evidence, and motive, to sustain the petitioner's conviction and the death penalty. Based on its analysis, the Supreme Court dismissed the petitioner's appeal and upheld the conviction and sentence imposed by the lower courts.",

The motive behind the incident was claimed to be a dispute over land possession. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was falsely implicated and that the cross-version recorded against him was fabricated. They further contended that the petitioner's family had previously lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against the complainant, suggesting a counterblast. The delay in recording the cross-version was also highlighted as a factor challenging its authenticity. The defense maintained that the case involved two conflicting versions, and it was yet to be determined who initiated the altercation. They requested bail for further inquiry into the matter.On the other hand, the State's representative defended the impugned order and argued that the petitioner was specifically implicated in the cross-version for causing injuries, hence not deserving leniency.After hearing arguments from both sides and examining the available evidence, the court noted that the petitioner's father had initially lodged an FIR against the complainant and his co-accused, alleging severe injuries to the petitioner's brothers. The court observed that the complainant filed the cross-version six days later, implicating the petitioner. The court acknowledged the possibility of false implication for ulterior motives and emphasized that the merits of the case could be assessed during the trial. Referring to previous judgments, the court highlighted the importance of safeguarding an individual's liberty and converting the petition into an appeal, ultimately allowing the petitioner's request for pre-arrest bail.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner and respondent No.3 entered into marriage but their relationship turned tumultuous, leading the petitioner to file for dissolution of marriage. Respondent No.3 later attempted to divorce the petitioner, but the divorce deed was initially declared ineffective, leading to legal proceedings. The current case involves an application by respondent No.3, under section 12(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, seeking to set aside the order. The petitioner contested this application, asserting that the Family Court, not a Civil Judge, should have jurisdiction in the matter. The trial court allowed the application, a decision contested by the petitioner in a revision petition, which was initially allowed but later remanded. The revisional court ultimately dismissed the petition, leading to the current constitutional petition. The petitioner argued that the judgments are flawed and illegal, citing the misapplication of section 17 of the Family Courts Act, 1964, and overlooking amendments to sections 21 and 21-A. However, the court emphasizes that a mere error in citing a section does not oust jurisdiction if the court has the authority to address the matter. The court underscored the Family Court's power to entertain applications related to fraud and misrepresentation, citing legal precedents such as Mst. Safia Bibi v. Mst. Aisha Bibi (1982 SCMR 494), Jane Margrete William v. Abdul Hamid Mian (1994 SCMR 1555), Rauf B Kadir v. State Bank of Pakistan (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1111), Olas Khan and others v.

Muhammad Imran, the son of the petitioner, Muhammad Amin, also filed a suit seeking restitution of conjugal rights. The petitioner was a defendant in the dower recovery suit. The Family Court issued partial decrees, dismissing Muhammad Imran's suit for restitution of conjugal rights but partly allowing Asima Sadiq's claims. Both parties appealed the decision. While Muhammad Imran's appeal was dismissed, Asima Sadiq's appeal was partially accepted through a writ petition, leading to a remand to the Additional District Judge to provide specific findings on Issue No.4 regarding the petitioner's status in the suit. Post-remand, the Additional District Judge concluded that the petitioner was a necessary party. Subsequently, an execution petition ensued, contested by the petitioner, who argued that the decree was not executable against him. Despite objections, the executing court rejected them, prompting the petitioner to file the current petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan. In support of his case, the petitioner cites legal precedents to underscore the principle that an executing court cannot exceed the bounds of the decree. Specifically referencing \"Ch. AHMED NAWAZ versus PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Land Acquisition Collector, Jhelum and others\" (2015 SCMR 823) and \"IRSHAD MASIH and others versus EMMANUEL MASIH and others\" (2014 SCMR 1481), the petitioner argued that the decree is solely against Muhammad Imran, and the alternate price fixed for the dower property removes any impediment to its execution against him. Consequently, the court accepted the petition.",

The prosecution's narrative revolved around a family dispute between the deceased, Muhammad Boota, and his second wife, Mst.

The judgment highlighted various deficiencies in the prosecution's case, including the lack of credible evidence supporting the alleged illicit relations, the absence of valid reasons for the presence of key witnesses at the time and place of the occurrence, and inconsistencies in the testimonies. Justice Farooq Haider underscored the unexplained delay in conducting the postmortem examination, casting doubt on the credibility of the entire case. Notably, the judgment referenced legal precedents, including the cases of \"Haroon Shafique versus The State and others,\" \"Mian Sohail Ahmad and others(2019 SCMR 956),versus The State and others,\" and \"Muhammad Yasin and another versus The State through P.G. Punjab and others,\"(2020 SCMR 1237)to emphasize the importance of timely registration of cases and the foundational role of the first information report (FIR) in criminal proceedings. The court raised concerned about the reliability of eyewitness accounts and noted the absence of a valid motive. It scrutinized the recovery of a pistol from the appellant, deeming it inconsequential due to a lack of matching evidence. Ultimately, the court concluded that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The order of acquittal for Sarwat Begum was upheld.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (Death Sentence--upheld) The appellant, Imran Mehmood, was tried for murder and attempted murder. The trial court convicted him and sentenced him to death, which was upheld by the high court. The prosecution's case was that the appellant, along with two co-accused, shot and killed the father and uncle of the complainant while they were trying to retrieve dowry articles. The appellant's wife had filed a suit for recovery of dowry articles, and the court had issued a decree in her favor. The appellant opened fire on the complainant's family, resulting in the deaths of the father and uncle. The court found the ocular evidence provided by the prosecution witnesses to be reliable and consistent. The witnesses had no motive to falsely implicate the appellant, and their accounts were supported by the medical evidence. The court also noted that the promptness of filing the First Information Report (FIR) indicated the truthfulness of the prosecution's case. The court rejected the appellant's argument that there were contradictions and improvements in the testimonies of the witnesses, as the defense failed to point out any major contradictions that would undermine the prosecution's case. The court also found that minor discrepancies in the evidence should be ignored if they do not affect the material considerations of the case. Regarding the confession made by the appellant before a judicial magistrate, the court found it to be voluntary and admissible as evidence. The appellant had been informed of his rights and given sufficient time to consider making a confession. In conclusion, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence of death imposed on the appellant by the trial court. The court found the prosecution's case to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt based on reliable ocular and medical evidence.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: After taking early retirement on medical grounds and subsequently passing away, his wife filed a claim for the sum assured from the insurer. The insurer repudiated the claim, stating that the revised policy did not cover early retirees. In response, respondent No. 1 filed an application for recovery of the group insurance claim and liquidated damages. The case was heard by the Insurance Tribunal, Punjab, which declined to grant liquidated damages based on the absence of a clause for such damages in the revised contract. However, the first Appellate Court held that under the implied terms of every contract of insurance, liquidated damages should be granted if the claim is not settled within ninety days without any fault of the claimant. Additionally, the Insurance Tribunal ruled that the legal heirs of the assured person had no standing to claim liquidated damages since the assured person was not a party to the group insurance contract. The first Appellate Court rejected this understanding, stating that group insurance is designed to provide benefits to the family of the assured person, and the insurer had already entertained the claim and paid the sum assured to the family. The Supreme Court, after considering both judgments, upheld the reasoning of the first Appellate Court and dismissed the appeal. The court concluded that the insurer's repudiation of the claim based on the revised contract was not lawful, and the legal heirs were entitled to receive liquidated damages under Section 118 of the Insurance Ordinance, 2000. The summary also mentions that the contract became effective after the repudiation letter was issued, and the insurer failed to prove that its failure to pay the claim within the stipulated time was due to circumstances beyond its control. As a result, the appeal was deemed without merit and dismissed by the Supreme Court.",

The consolidation of the two suits in a single proceeding was deemed inappropriate since causes from different jurisdictions cannot be consolidated. It was highlighted that suits challenging the validity of Nikah Nama entries fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the family court. The court further noted that an amendment to the Family Courts Act in Punjab in 2015 specified that suits challenging Nikah Nama entries should be tried exclusively by the family court. As a result, the suit filed by the petitioner should have been considered a family suit and properly consolidated with respondent No. 3's suit. After considering the arguments and reviewing the Nikah Nama entries, the court found no cutting or variation in the original record. The findings of fact recorded by the trial court were deemed correct, and the petitioner failed to demonstrate any jurisdictional defects committed by the lower courts. Therefore, the court refused to grant leave to appeal, and the petition was dismissed",

During the proceedings, the court directed Neha Ali to appear and ordered a medical board to determine Asima Bibi's gender. In compliance with the court's orders, Neha Ali was produced before the court, expressing her desire to live independently and continue her studies. The court, invoking Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, emphasized the liberty of an individual and set Neha Ali at liberty, allowing her to live as she pleases within the bounds of the law. The court directed law enforcement to provide security to Neha Ali and cautioned against any harassment by her family. It held that Neha Ali, being sui juris, cannot be detained against her wishes, and her freedom should be respected. Additionally, the court disapproved of the unwarranted observations on Neha Ali's marriage in the previous order by the Additional Sessions Judge and clarified that such matters should be addressed in Family Court or criminal proceedings. The court also ordered NADRA to reconsider the gender entry for Asima Bibi's CNIC, following proper legal procedures. The court recalled the order to place Asima Bibi in the Exit Control List, allowing the federal government to proceed as per legal requirements.",

Pakistan Bibi, had filed a suit seeking a declaration that she is the owner of a property measuring 122 kanals 5 marlas, which she claimed was given to her as dower (mahr) in the year 1967 through a dower deed (Nikah Nama). The suit also sought correction in the revenue record and a permanent injunction against the defendants from interfering with her possession.The trial court initially decreed the suit in favor of Mst. Pakistan Bibi in 2000, but the appellate court remanded the matter back to the trial court. In subsequent rounds of litigation, the trial court dismissed the suit, and the appellate court upheld the dismissal. Mst. Pakistan Bibi then filed a civil revision before the Peshawar High Court, which allowed the revision, setting aside the judgments and decrees of the lower courts and decreeing the suit in her favor. The present appeal was filed against this decision.The appellant, Pirzada Noor-ul-Basar, argued that Mst. Pakistan Bibi's claim should have been filed before the Family Court as it pertained to dower, and that the Nikah Nama was not an authenticated document. The appellant also contended that the suit was time-barred under the Limitation Act, 1908.The Supreme Court, however, rejected these arguments and upheld the decision of the Peshawar High Court. It found that Mst. Pakistan Bibi had a valid claim to the property as she had been in possession of it and received Ijjara (rent) from tenants for many years. The court also held that the suit was not time-barred under the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act and that the Nikah Nama was a valid document, and the appellant could not challenge its authenticity at this stage.Ultimately, the Supreme Court found no merit in the appeal and dismissed it, affirming the judgment of the Peshawar High Court in favor of Mst. Pakistan Bibi.",

The petitioners' attempts to secure the land, including a writ petition and an application for allotment, were unsuccessful. The Chief Settlement Commissioner dismissed their petition to purchase the land at market price, leading to the current legal challenge. The court discussed the legal framework for the disposal of evacuee rural/agricultural land under the Evacuee Property and Displaced Persons Laws (Repeal) Act, 1975. The Act empowered the Board of Revenue to dispose of such land through a scheme, primarily emphasizing unrestricted open public auctions. The court cited the Supreme Court's decision emphasizing the necessity of disposing of public assets through transparent auctions. The court noted that the petitioners' predecessors had allegedly purchased the land from allottees, but these allotments were later canceled, and the land was resumed by the state. The court emphasized that the disputed land is public property and must be disposed of according to legal procedures, highlighting the principles of fairness, public interest, and avoiding favoritism in dealing with public assets. Ultimately, the court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the petitioners, being illegal occupants, are not entitled to discretionary relief.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (Right to liberty and right to privacy under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution - DNA test cannot be conducted without consent of the party in civil cases) The petitioner had filed a writ petition challenging a gift mutation made by the deceased Muhammad Hussain in favor of the petitioner. The respondents, claiming to be legal heirs of Muhammad Hussain, alleged that the petitioner was not his son and had obtained the gift mutation fraudulently. The trial court dismissed an application by the respondents for a DNA test of the petitioner and two other individuals. However, the revisional court allowed the application, ordering the DNA test. The petitioner challenged this order in the High Court, but it was dismissed. The petitioner then filed the present petition seeking leave to appeal. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, emphasized the fundamental rights of privacy and liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. It noted that ordering a DNA test without the consent of the individuals involved infringes their fundamental rights. The court highlighted that privacy encompasses protection from unwarranted intrusion into personal lives, including personal information and family life. It stated that the conducting of a DNA test without consent violates these rights. The court also discussed the right to liberty, which includes freedom from arbitrary or purposeless encroachments by the state. It emphasized that individuals have the right to control their bodies and make decisions about their healthcare. Unauthorized DNA collection was seen as a violation of bodily autonomy and personal freedom. Furthermore, the court noted that the presumption of paternity under the law could be used when a person refuses to undergo a DNA test. However, this presumption does not apply to individuals who are not parties to the proceedings and have not given their consent for a DNA test. Based on these considerations, the Supreme Court concluded that the revisional court and the High Court had erred in ordering the DNA test without the consent of the individuals involved. The court highlighted the importance of other evidence presented by the petitioner to establish his relationship with the deceased Muhammad Hussain. It emphasized that if the petitioner could prove his mother's valid marriage to Muhammad Hussain, it would conclusively establish his legitimacy as the son of Muhammad Hussain, as per the law. In light of these findings, the Supreme Court determined that there was no jurisdictional error in the trial court's order and denied the petitioner leave to appeal.",

The judgment raised concerns about the reliability of the prosecution's case, highlighting unnatural conduct of witnesses and contradictions in their statements. The court questions the credibility of the witnesses, emphasizing that the complainant's family members did not intervene during the alleged assault. Moreover, the court noted the absence of key witnesses who were residents of the same house where the incident occurred. The prosecution's failure to produce these witnesses and medical records from hospitals is seen as withholding crucial evidence. The court concluded that the prosecution failed to prove the alleged motive and highlights the lack of evidence supporting the complainant's version. It criticized the prosecution for not addressing the contradictions in the witnesses' statements and relying on weak evidence. The court accepted the appeal of Mst. Shaukat Bibi, setting aside her conviction and sentence, and acquitted her of the charge under section 302(b) PPC due to the benefit of doubt.

The court discussed the right to privacy, the non-absoluteness of privacy rights, and the necessity for balancing conflicting interests. It emphasizes that the court should not become a tool for unscrupulous purposes and should order medical examinations only in exceptional circumstances when no alternative is available. The court also recognized Act XIII of 2018, a Pakistani law recognizing transgender rights. It referred to principles like informed consent and the relevance of medical examinations in family court matters. The court concluded that while Family Courts can direct parties to undergo medical examinations, such power is subject to specific conditions. Regarding the petitioner's request, the court finds the application premature and sets aside the lower court's order, suggesting the petitioner's evidence and circumstances should justify such an examination. The court instructed the Family Court to frame an additional issue about the validity of the marriage based on the wife's gender characteristics and decides on the medical examination after further evidence is presented. It also introduced a security deposit mechanism to protect the wife from potential harassment and states that she cannot be forced into the examination. The court emphasized the need for careful consideration of privacy rights, legal principles, and the specific circumstances surrounding the request for a medical examination in family court cases.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: (Bail Denied---Exceptions to rule of granting bail in non-prohibitory clause offences; and (ii) gravity of the offence of housebreaking by night, (iii) vicarious liability)--- The petitioner, along with others, entered the complainant's house and subjected him and his family members to intimidation. The petitioner allegedly dragged his daughter-in-law out onto the street and shot his son, causing his death. The petitioner and his accomplices also caused injuries to other family members. The courts below found sufficient incriminating evidence to connect the petitioner with the alleged offenses, leading to the denial of post-arrest bail. The petitioner's counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to establish the petitioner's involvement in the crimes. Alternatively, it was argued that the offense of intentional homicide was not attributed to the petitioner, and his vicarious liability under Section 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code could only be determined during the trial. The counsel further contended that since some of the offenses did not fall within the prohibitory clause, the petitioner should be granted post-arrest bail under Section 497(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. After hearing arguments from both sides and examining the record of the case, the court found that the allegations against the petitioner were supported by witness statements, including the injured witness and residents of the house where the incident occurred. The court also noted that CCTV footage corroborated the incident. Consequently, there was sufficient incriminating material to connect the petitioner with the offenses, and the findings of the lower courts were not arbitrary or perverse. The court addressed the question of vicarious liability, stating that it could be considered at the bail stage, but in this case, even if the question was left for determination during the trial, the petitioner was not entitled to bail based on the facts and circumstances. The court further explained the exceptions to granting bail in non-prohibitory clause offenses, which include the likelihood of absconding, tampering with evidence, influencing witnesses, or repeating the offense. In this case, the court found that the petitioner, being the father of the alleged abductee, had a motive for the offenses, and there was a likelihood of absconding. Additionally, the abductee had not been recovered, and there was a possibility of harm or coercion if the petitioner were released on bail. Thus, the exceptions justifying the denial of bail were applicable in this case. The court also noted that the offenses involved the sanctity and privacy of the home, protected by Article 14 of the Constitution. The severity of the crimes and the importance of ensuring safety within one's home were emphasized. Based on these reasons, the court found no legal fault in the High Court's decision to deny post-arrest bail to the petitioner. The petition was dismissed, and leave to appeal was refused.",

Some concerns were raised, including the need for no objection certificates (NOC) from specific banks, disclosure of the value of intellectual property, and approval from shareholders. The petitioners addressed objections, providing NOCs and justifying the lack of valuation for intellectual property due to common ownership within the Dawood Family. The court, acting as a sanctioning authority, evaluated the compliance with legal requirements, the fairness of the scheme, and the commercial wisdom of the involved parties. The court found that all essential statutory benchmarks were met, and the proposed schemes did not violate laws or public policy.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: International Child Abduction----The case involved a South African Muslim petitioner who got married to Respondent No.3 from Pakistan in 2010. In 2016, the family came to Pakistan for a visit, and after the petitioner returned to South Africa, Respondent No.3 stayed in Pakistan with the children on the pretext of his father's illness. The petitioner alleged that he deceived her, keeping the children in Pakistan. In April 2019, when she came to Pakistan, Respondent No.3 mistreated her, leading to the filing of a writ petition for the recovery of the children.The court noted the increasing international disputes involving child custody due to globalization. The court referred to international conventions like the Hague Convention and the need for prompt decisions in abduction cases. However, due to the complex nature of the case, the court decides that a detailed inquiry is required to determine factors like the family's intention to settle in Pakistan, acquiescence, and the children's development of roots in the country. The court advised the petitioner to seek remedies before the Guardian Court, considering the Guardianship Certificate's legal standing. The court also highlighted the petitioner's obligation to obtain a court order before taking the children out of Pakistan. The jurisdiction of the Guardian Court is acknowledged, given the children's status as citizens of Pakistan by descent. The court emphasized the need for an in-depth inquiry and redirected the petitioner to the Guardian Court for a comprehensive resolution of the custody dispute.",

They were convicted for homicide and murderous assault and sentenced to life imprisonment with additional years of rigorous imprisonment and fines. They were also directed to pay compensation.According to the prosecution, the petitioners, along with a co-accused Mehar Ali, committed the crime by targeting the deceased and another individual with firearms and a hatchet. The incident occurred on 15.6.1998. The prosecution's case was primarily based on the testimony of eyewitnesses Haji Muhammad Siddique (PW-1), Ali Sher (PW-2), and the injured Khamiso Khan (PW-4).The petitioners' counsel argued that the occurrence did not take place as alleged, and there was a family dispute that led to false implications. The absence of weapon recovery was highlighted as a weakness in the prosecution's case. The counsel contended that the acquittal of the co-accused weakened the prosecution's case.However, the court found the prosecution's evidence strong and credible. The eyewitnesses provided detailed and consistent accounts of the incident. The court also considered the promptness in approaching the law and the medical examination of the injured Khamiso Khan. The failure to recover the weapons did not significantly impact the prosecution's case.The court upheld the convictions and sentences, but it modified the amount of Daman (compensation) imposed on the convicts due to their advanced age, reducing it to Rs. 1000/-. The jail petition was dismissed, and leave to appeal was declined.",

Naheed Akhtar, a resident of Norway, had come to Pakistan to construct a house, and the motive behind the attack was stated to be financial disputes. The appellant claimed innocence, asserting a false implication due to family disputes and an attempted suicide by the victim. The court analyzed the evidence, emphasizing the admissibility and reliability of the dying declaration. Despite the failure to prove the charge of murder, the court concluded that the appellant caused burn injuries to the victim. Consequently, the court set aside the murder conviction but found the appellant guilty under section 336-B PPC (causing hurt by corrosive substance) and sentenced him to fourteen years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine.",

The impugned order would amount to a decision given in terms of Section 14 of the Act, consequently, an appeal against the same would be available before the appellate court on any available ground; hence the constitutional petition is premature and not maintainable due to availability of alternate remedy and the same is disposed of as such.",

The petitioner appealed against this judgment, raising several grounds for challenging the decision. The motive behind the incident was reported to be a dispute over the discharge of filthy water from the petitioner's rooftop. The police investigation resulted in the recovery of a .12 caliber pump-action gun and casings, and autopsy confirmed multiple gunshot injuries on the deceased. The petitioner's counsel argued that the complainant had implicated the entire family and failed to prove the petitioner's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They also questioned the forensic report's significance and relied on the inconclusive motive. However, the court rejected these arguments, stating that the petitioner's nomination as the main assailant, along with the consistent ocular account provided by witnesses, established his involvement in the crime. The acquittal of the petitioner's sons was not seen as undermining the case against the petitioner. The court found the prosecution's evidence to be credible and convincing, and thus, upheld the conviction and denied leave for further appeal.",

Subsequently, Imdad Ullah, allegedly influenced by his brother (respondent No.4), forged a divorce deed without the petitioner's knowledge. The petitioner was sent back to Pakistan, and four months later, she learned about the divorce. The petitioner challenged the divorce registration certificate and confirmation order, claiming they were illegal, void ab initio, and issued without notice.The central issue was the jurisdiction of the Chairman of the Union Council to pass the impugned order and issue the divorce registration certificate. The judgment cited relevant sections of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and Rules under the ordinance. It emphasized that jurisdiction lies with the Union Council where the wife was residing at the time of divorce pronouncement.Given that the petitioner was residing in the USA at the time of the alleged divorce, the judgment referred to a relevant notification authorizing officers of Pakistan Mission abroad to act as Chairman under the ordinance. The Court concluded that the Chairman, Union Council Chak No.94/NP, Khanpur, had no authority in this case. Additionally, it highlighted procedural lapses, such as the absence of attestation for documents and the unauthorized participation of Imdad Ullah's brother in the proceedings.Consequently, the impugned divorce registration certificate and confirmation order were declared legally ineffective and set aside. The constitutional petition filed by Mst. Asma Bibi was allowed.",

The respondents argue that the petitioner has not paid any maintenance for minors and was aware of the proceedings.The order sheet discusses the issue of the statute of limitations for setting aside an ex-parte decree, referring to a Supreme Court case (Maj. Matloob Ali Khan v. Additional District Judge, 1988 SCMR 747) declaring the 30-day limitation as ultra-vires. The court concludes that the lower courts committed a grave illegality in violating the Supreme Court's verdict.The court accepts the petition, sets aside the impugned decisions, and deems the application for setting aside the ex-parte judgment & decree as pending for fresh consideration by the Trial Court. The petitioner is directed to pay maintenance to the minors, and the Registrar is instructed to circulate the order for information and compliance by courts in the province.

However, the petitioner's salary, as the legal heir, was stopped in June 2017, citing Punjab Civil Service Pension Rules.The petitioner argued that he is entitled to receive full pay and allowances of his Shaheed (martyred) father until the date of superannuation (31.12.2028) with increments and other benefits at revised rates. The respondents contended that disbursement of full pay to legal heirs is in accordance with the Punjab Civil Services Pension Rules, and since the petitioner is above 24 years of age, he is not entitled to full pay, allowance, or pensionary benefits.The Amicus Curie argued that the petitioner is entitled to pay and allowances until the age of superannuation, as specified in the relevant notifications. The court examined various notifications dating back to 1991, which granted benefits to the families of Shaheed police officials. The court found that the benefit in question was accrued in favor of the petitioner's family in 1994 and that the petitioner had been receiving it until May 2017.The court concluded that the petitioner's vested right could not be taken away through a notification issued in 2017 and emphasized that the retrospective application of a policy withdrawing vested rights is not plausible. The court allowed the petition, directing the respondents to disburse full pay and allowances to the petitioner until the superannuation of his Shaheed father, along with increments and benefits, and ordered the payment of arrears.",

The incident occurred due to a dispute over water in the precincts of Police Station Saddar Vehari. The petitioner was sentenced to death, while his brothers were given life imprisonment. The High Court altered the petitioner's penalty to life imprisonment and acquitted the co-convicts.The petitioner's counsel argued that the ocular account provided by the witnesses was unreliable, and there was no motive established for the petitioner's involvement in the murder. The counsel also pointed out discrepancies in the medical examination and crime report, suggesting the possibility of innocent proxies being involved. The Court noted that the entire family had been implicated in the crime, and the single fatal wound did not align with the array of accused individuals.Considering the uncertainty and potential errors in identifying the actual offender, the Court found it unsafe to maintain the petitioner's conviction. The jail petition was converted into an appeal, and the Court acquitted the petitioner of the charges. The impugned judgment was set aside, and the petitioner was ordered to be released forthwith",

However, since the respondent resided in Karachi, it was not feasible to execute the decree in Islamabad. The applicant, Mst. Kulsoom Rasheed, represented herself and requested the transfer of the case from the Judge Family Court in Islamabad West to the competent jurisdiction of the Family Court in Karachi, Sindh. The applicant relied on Section 25-A (2-B) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, which allows for the transfer of cases from one province to another. The relevant provision was quoted in the order. After considering the legal position and the circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court found that it would be burdensome for the respondent to participate in the proceedings in Islamabad, considering that he resided in Karachi. Therefore, to protect the rights and interests of both parties and ensure a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 10A of the Constitution, the Supreme Court ordered the transfer of the execution proceedings to the District Judge in Karachi. The transferee court would continue the proceedings from where they were left off, after due notice to the respondent.",

The court observed that the delay in reporting the alleged abduction and rape, the existence of a valid Nikah between the petitioner and the complainant, and the contradictory versions presented in the FIR and other documents raised doubts about the reliability of the evidence. The court emphasized that disputes involving marriage should be decided by Family Courts, and criminal courts should await the outcome of the family court proceedings. The court granted post-arrest bail to Muhammad Yousaf, a previous non-convict, with the case deemed one of further inquiry into the petitioner's guilt. Bail was subject to furnishing bonds of Rs. 500,000 with two sureties each, to the satisfaction of the trial court.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [Impact of fraud practiced upon tribunals exercising plenary or limited jurisdictions, respectively, cannot be procedurally classified as in all jurisdictions it un-redeamedly vitiates the very solemnity of adjudication, a wrong that cannot be countenanced and must be remedied through dynamic application of equitable principles of law] The main argument presented by the petitioner's counsel was that the suit filed by Khurshid Begum was fraudulently devised and structured, using a marriage certificate with interpolated entries to defeat the petitioner's legitimate rights. The respondent's counsel argued that the land in question was given as dower to Khurshid Begum and that no subsequent transactions could invalidate her interest in the land. After hearing the arguments and examining the record, the Supreme Court held that the Family Court had the jurisdiction to reexamine its earlier decision and set aside the decree if it was tainted by fraud or misrepresentation. The Court noted that the Family Court Act of 1964 excluded certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, but this did not prevent the Family Court from protecting its orders and decrees from fraud. The Court concluded that the Family Court could borrow procedures from other available avenues to rectify any manipulation or abuse of its jurisdiction. The Court referred to previous cases where fraud had been held to vitiate proceedings, even in jurisdictions that excluded the wholesale application of the Code. It rejected the suggestion of resorting to plenary jurisdiction and instead ordered the reconsideration of the impugned judgment and decree by the Family Court. The petitioner's claim in the property was to be attended to by the Additional District Judge, Multan, before whom the petitioner's application under section 12(2) of the Code would be deemed pending. Previous judgment was set aside.",

Waheed Ahmad agreed to sell his share to Bashir Ahmad, leading to a specific performance suit and later a partition suit. The petitioner, after a significant delay, filed an application under section 4 of the Act, claiming the property as an undivided dwelling of a family and expressing willingness to purchase the share of respondents for a specified amount. The court, in its analysis, questions the delay in raising the plea under section 4, considering the conduct of the petitioners and their predecessor. It observed that the petitioners did not challenge the sale or decree earlier and concludes that their conduct reflects waiver and estoppel. The court also examined the merits of the objection under section 4 and cites relevant legal provisions and precedents. Additionally, the court noted the abuse of legal process by the judgment-debtors and emphasizes the need to address the prolonged execution proceedings. The court dismissed the revision, imposes costs on the petitioner, and directs the executing court to proceed with the execution of the decree promptly.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The respondent's father, who was a Senior Auditor in the office of Accountant General KPK, Peshawar, died in 1995. On 13.06.2006, the Government of Pakistan issued an 'Assistance Package for Families of Government Employees who die in service,' which allowed eligible family members of deceased government servants to be employed in posts from BS-01 to BS-15 on a two-year contract without advertisement. This package was subsequently amended on multiple occasions.The respondent applied for appointment under this package but received no response. As a result, he filed a writ petition before the Peshawar High Court seeking appointment under the package. The High Court allowed the petition, directing the appellant to appoint the respondent in accordance with the package.The appellant argued that the Assistance Package was not in effect when the respondent's father died, and therefore, it should not be applied retrospectively. They contended that the High Court's interpretation that a statute or rule giving rights to citizens operates retrospectively was incorrect.After considering the arguments and the relevant package, the Supreme Court held that the Assistance Package was not available at the time of the respondent's father's death, and it was issued later with prospective effect. Thus, the respondent was not deprived of any right accrued to him at the relevant time. The Court found that the High Court's presumption that such statutes or rules always operate retrospectively was erroneous and could lead to unwarranted consequences.Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned judgment of the Peshawar High Court.",

The court rejected the jurisdiction argument, stating that both the Arbitration Council and Family Courts under the Act have concurrent jurisdiction in family matters. It referred to previous judgments, to highlight the need to avoid contradictory decisions from both forums. On the merits, the court noted the petitioner's employment abroad and foreign earnings.

The court noted that the petitioner had contracted Nikah with Mst. Maryam Latif and provided a copy of the Nikahnama as evidence. Mst. Maryam Latif herself acknowledged the marriage through an affidavit and filed a petition under sections 22-A and 22-B Cr.P.C. affirming her marriage with the petitioner. The court observed that the alleged victim had also filed a suit for jactitation of marriage in a Family Court, which indicated a matrimonial issue rather than a criminal case. Considering the circumstances and the possibility that the complainant might have implicated the petitioner out of animosity, the court granted bail after arrest. The court emphasized that the grant of bail did not imply the acquittal of the accused but was a change of custody from the state to surety. The petitioner was a non-convict, had been in custody since August 17, 2018, and the investigation was complete. The court granted bail on the condition that the petitioner furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 500,000/- with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.",

The petitioner and Zia Shah, who remained a proclaimed offender, were alleged to have assaulted the deceased with a hatchet and club due to family disputes.The complainant, Ayyaz Hussain Shah, lodged the crime report, and after absconding, the petitioner was arrested on 24.1.2006 and later convicted under clause (b) of Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code. The High Court upheld the conviction but commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment.In the jail petition, the petitioner argued that the courts relied heavily on the testimonies of interested witnesses without sufficient corroboration. The petitioner claimed that the acquittal of Ashiq Shah, who had no role in the crime, undermined the prosecution's case and raised doubts about the conviction.However, the court found that the petitioner was directly involved in the murder of Iqbal Shah, as evidenced by medical evidence and the consistent testimonies of multiple witnesses. The court rejected the argument that Ashiq Shah's acquittal affected the petitioner's case and upheld the guilty verdict.While the court upheld the conviction, it ordered that the sentences for the petitioner's involvement in Iqbal Shah's murder should run concurrently, granting him the benefit of the time already served. The jail petition was dismissed, and leave was declined.",

The appellant's counsel contended that the witnesses' testimonies did not inspire confidence and raised doubts about the motive and circumstances of the crime. They argued that it was the first day the family had moved to the house, and there was no reason for the appellant to know about Fareeda's presence. They also questioned the choice of weapon (a razor) and the appellant's actions after Fareeda was already dead. After considering the arguments and examining the record, the Supreme Court found it difficult to believe that the appellant could have carried out the murders with impunity in the presence of numerous witnesses. The use of a razor as a weapon and the inaction of the witnesses further raised doubts. The Court concluded that the prosecution had not presented the whole truth and that there was insufficient evidence to maintain the conviction without the risk of error. Therefore, the Court granted the benefit of the doubt to the appellant, acquitted him of the charges, and ordered his immediate release if not required by any other law.",

The cheques bounced upon presentation, and the petitioner, avoiding arrest for some time, sought judicial protection.Before the Supreme Court, the petitioner argued that he had handed over the cheques to his brother Syed Zulqarnain as security instruments for settling a family feud, but they were fraudulently taken over by the complainant. The cancellation of the cheques is being pursued through a declaratory suit in a Civil Court at Chunian.The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that the impugned instruments belonged to the petitioner and carried the word \"shorty\" on their back. However, the petitioner's counsel failed to demonstrate any contractual clause or agreement in performance of which the petitioner stood as surety. The Court upheld the statutory presumption of the validity of the instrument, stating that a drawer cannot escape the consequences of its failure merely by claiming to be an unsuspecting surety.Furthermore, the Court noted that within a close family, the petitioner had not shown any malice or animosity that could justify diverting the usual course of criminal law. The concurrent view taken by the lower courts was deemed to be well within the legal boundaries and did not require interference.The Supreme Court, therefore, dismissed the petition, declining to grant leave.",

He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, but the High Court converted his conviction to clause (c) of Section 302, leading to a reduction in the sentence to the period already undergone by him.The State, represented by Ms. Abida Safdar, the learned Additional Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, challenged the High Court's decision, arguing that the case of filicide was clear-cut, leaving no room for leniency. The State contended that the respondent acted deliberately and callously, taking the life of an innocent young man, and that the reduced sentence was inadequate to deliver justice to the deceased and his grieving family. The State requested the Supreme Court to reconsider the evidence and impose a proportionate sentence to secure the ends of justice.The Supreme Court granted leave to reappraise the entire evidence and issued bailable warrants for the respondent in the amount of Rs. 200,000, returnable to the Assistant Registrar of the Court at Peshawar.

The court noted inconsistencies in the statements of witnesses and observed that the learned trial court had disbelieved the prosecution's version regarding certain serious charges. The court, citing legal principles, deemed the statement inadmissible due to the lack of an opportunity for cross-examination, which affected the overall credibility of the case.

They were tried through a private complaint before a Special Judge under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The trial court acquitted them of the charge, but Abdul Ghafoor was convicted under section 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code and the remaining accused were sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 500,000 each. The acquittal of Abdul Ghafoor and the conviction of the others were challenged in the Islamabad High Court, which upheld the conviction of the remaining accused. The petitioners, Muhammad Makki and Alam Sher, filed criminal petitions before the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Islamabad High Court.The petitioners argued that there was no valid reason for the High Court to overturn the well-reasoned judgment of the trial court, especially since the co-accused were acquitted. They contended that the High Court's refusal to consider the abduction for ransom charge led to the dismissal of the entire case, and they sought the intervention of the Supreme Court.The incident occurred in September 2009 when the abductee, Aamir Shahzad, went missing. The complainant, his sister, received a ransom call demanding 25 crore rupees. The abductee was later rescued, and some of the accused were apprehended from the scene.The Supreme Court reviewed the case and found that the trial court judgment dealt excessively with peripheral issues and lapses in the investigative process. It highlighted discordance within the crisis-stricken family but failed to consider the preponderance of evidence furnished by natural witnesses. The High Court had rightly assessed the evidence, which successfully established the charge against the petitioners.The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of a dynamic and realistic approach in administering criminal justice while ensuring procedural fairness. It upheld the High Court's decision to convict the petitioners, stating that their partial failure on one charge and the acquittal of a co-accused did not invalidate the integrity of the overall charge. The petitions were dismissed, and leave to appeal was declined.",

They claimed that the evidence provided by the prosecution was not strong enough to warrant a conviction. Additionally, the petitioners pointed out discrepancies in the deposition of the police surgeon regarding the date of examination, which they claimed affected the credibility of the evidence.After hearing the arguments and examining the record, the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the petitioners. The Court noted that the evidence presented by the prosecution, including the witnesses' testimony and the site plan showing broken glass in the shop, supported the guilty verdict. The Court dismissed the petitioners' claim that they were unfairly implicated due to a family dispute and rejected their challenge to the credibility of the police surgeon's evidence.The Court also addressed the concern raised by the petitioners about the possible loss of pensionary benefits for the family of the deceased petitioner, Javed Ahmed. The Court held that this consequence of the crime should not be a ground to overturn Javed Ahmed's conviction, as he was part of the joint criminal act and was rightly convicted based on the evidence.In conclusion, the Supreme Court found no merit in the petition and declined to grant leave.",

The petitioner claimed that the minors were taken from her custody on 25.01.2019.The court, considering the ages of the minors and the petitioner's rights as the mother, found that no counter affidavit challenging the petitioner's claims had been filed. Although the marriage between the parties was not intact, there was nothing adverse against the petitioner to deny her custody. The court interviewed Muhammad Farhan, one of the detained minors, who revealed that he worked at a motorcycle shop and did not attend school.Respondent No. 2's counsel argued that the matter was pending before the Guardian court, and decisions related to custody and welfare should be left to that court. However, the court, invoking its power under Section 491 Cr.P.C., emphasized its duty to ensure the welfare of the minors and prevent harm due to the breakdown of family ties. The court cited the case of Mirjam Aberras Lehdeaho v. S.H.O., Police Station Chung, Lahore (2018 SCMR 427).Consequently, the court allowed the petition, ordering the custody of the minors to be handed over to the petitioner. The petitioner was directed to facilitate respondent No. 2's meetings with the children as directed by the Guardian court, emphasizing that the Guardian court's decision would be independent of the observations in this order.",

However, after investigation, the police found the allegations false and recommended FIR cancellation. During the revision, it was revealed that the petitioner altered his story significantly in the private complaint, and key witnesses were not mentioned in the FIR. The complainant made two allegations: torture leading to his father's death and Mst. Razia Bibi pouring a liquid into his father's mouth. Medical evidence contradicted the allegations, indicating the cause of death as a cardiac arrest, not injury or poisoning. Hospital records showed the deceased was taken to the hospital by Ahmad Faraz (a distant relative), not the complainant. Previous disputes within the family, including a previous FIR against the petitioner, his father's first wife, and ongoing property litigation, were also noted. Consequently, the criminal revision was dismissed in limine (at the outset).",

It set aside the impugned notification, declaring that a child of deceased parents who were government servants is entitled to two pensions simultaneously according to their eligibility.The decision emphasized that the drawal of pension was a vested right of the child, and such rights cannot be taken away through a notification with retrospective effect.",

The petitioner's counsel contended that the Family Court lacked jurisdiction in custody matters, and even if the petitioner had compromised, she cannot be deprived of her right to 'Hizanat.' The court dismissed the objection that a similar petition was previously dismissed, stating that an earlier decision in a habeas corpus matter does not operate as res judicata.

During her hospitalization, the maternal grandfather took custody of the minor children and continued to have custody until the time of filing the petition.The petitioner claimed that he made efforts to regain custody but was unsuccessful, leading him to file a petition under Section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, seeking custody of the minors based on his preferential right as the father. The Family Court granted him custody, but on appeal, the Appellate Court reversed the decision, and the High Court upheld the appellate court's decision, considering the welfare of the minors as the paramount consideration.The petitioner argued that he is the natural guardian and has the preferential right to custody, and he would reside in Pakistan to take care of the minors. However, the Court noted that the petitioner's previous behavior and attitude towards his wife and children were not satisfactory, and the minors expressed their reluctance to live with him. The Court emphasized that the welfare of the minors is of paramount consideration as per the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.Considering the circumstances, the Court dismissed the petition but maintained the visitation schedule previously ordered by the Family Court for the grandparents, which would now apply to the petitioner.",

The judgment noted that the respondents were proceeded against ex-parte due to their non-appearance. The court provided a summary of the facts, including the strained relationship between the parties, the expulsion of the respondents from the petitioner's house, and the subsequent filing of a suit for maintenance allowance. The Family Court partially decreed the suit, granting maintenance allowance for the minors and the Respondent No. 1. The petitioner appealed, and the Appellate Court partially allowed the appeal, decreeing the suit for restitution of conjugal rights but declining the rest of the petitioner's claims. The judgment observed that the courts below failed to discuss the documentary evidence, particularly the petitioner's salary slip, which indicated a net pay of Rs. 18,252/-. The court emphasized the importance of considering documentary evidence in determining the financial status of the petitioner for fixing maintenance. It noted that both lower courts did not properly assess the evidence and, as a result, modified the judgments. The court allowed the constitutional petition, modifying the judgments and decrees. The quantum of maintenance for Respondents No. 2 and 3 was reduced from Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 3,000/- per month each with a 10% annual increase from the institution of the suit. It also mentioned that the petitioner, having paid the entire amount in court, should have the amount already received by the respondents adjusted by the executing court. The court also highlighted that Respondent No. 1 was not entitled to maintenance until she fulfilled matrimonial obligations due to the decree of restitution of conjugal rights.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In the legal analysis, it was stressed that three sisters, including one who had passed away, had initially sold their shares in the property to the appellant. Testimonies from family members supported the sale, but the challenging party, despite being alive, did not testify in person. Instead, her husband testified on her behalf as her attorney. The Court scrutinized this aspect, emphasizing that the challenging party's failure to testify and provide reasons for not doing so weakened her claim that she had not sold the land.Furthermore, the Court evaluated the legal principle that withholding the best evidence can lead to adverse presumptions, as outlined in Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984. The attorney for the challenging party's admission that the sale was due to financial need was deemed credible evidence. The Court also noted that the challenging party's husband, who was also her attorney, held a prominent local position, making it implausible that he was unaware of the sale.The Court invoked legal provisions, referring to the Evidence Act, 1872, specifically section 68, which mandates the presence of an attesting witness for document execution proof. Notably, the proviso to this section was highlighted, stating that an attesting witness need not be called if the execution is specifically denied. As the challenging party did not specifically deny the sale's execution, this proviso was applicable.Conclusively, the Court found that the sale was established through evidence, including the admission made by the challenging party's attorney. It criticized the High Court's decision to overturn the lower court's judgment based on the lack of established sale. Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the impugned judgment and dismissing the challenging party's suit.",

Observation: a decision given by the family court is appealable provided the said decision is not an interim order as provided in Sub Section 3 of Section 14 of the Act. Every order passed during the pendency of a family suit cannot be treated merely as an interlocutory order if the said order finally determines an issue. Non-fixation of interim maintenance allowance of minor under Section 17-A of the Act is tantamount to decline relief of interim maintenance permissible during the pendency of suit which amounts to final determination of claim to that extent, hence cannot be treated merely as an interim/interlocutory order that does not finally determine anything. The said order would amount to a Decision Given in terms of Section 14 of the Act and appeal against the same would be available before the appellate court.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [1. Under Article 129 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, the court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened. Illustration (g) attached to this Article is quite relevant to the facts and circumstances of the case in hand in which the court may draw adverse inference or presumption that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavorable to the person who withholds it. 2. According to Order 6 Rule 1 C.P.C, the term ?pleadings? include the plaint and the written statement, whereas Order 6 Rule 2 C.P.C accentuates, that every pleading shall contain a statement in concise form of the material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence. It is also a well settled exposition of law that no party can lead evidence beyond the pleadings.3. The denotation and import of phrase ?Pardanashin lady? depicts a woman who heeded stringent and unyielding canons and ethics of seclusion and privacy and according to the customs may object to show up in a public office or have no communication except behind the screen with any male person save as near relatives. 4. In our Holy Quran also, the believing women are commanded to draw their cloaks close round them (when they go abroad) and lower their gaze and guard their chastity and not to reveal their adornments except what normally appears. 5. In case of a document executed by a pardanashin lady, the burden of proof is on the party who depends on such a deed to persuade the Court that it has been read over to her and she had not only understood it but also received independent and disinterested advice in the matter. This benchmark is equally applicable to an illiterate and ignorant woman who may not be a pardanashin lady. 6. The obvious underlying principle is to protect and save a weak and helpless woman from danger and risk of an unfair deal, thenceforth, it is to be ensured by the court in tandem, whether the alleged deal or transaction was effected by her free will or through coercion/duress or emotional blackmailing or whether it was simply aimed to deprive her right or interest in the property or divest her due share in the inheritance by male members of her family because of their ignorance, inexperience of business matters and social conditions are not able to understand the nature of business transactions.7. In order to handle the issue of exemption of pardanashin lady from personal appearance in Courts, the Civil Procedure Code endows with specific provision with logical solution and forward-thinking to deal with the issue in an appropriate manner which is perhaps not applied objectively by the Civil Courts despite availability of a well-defined remedy with immemorial solution under Section 132 of C.P.C.8. The customs and manners advocated under Section 132 C.P.C, characterizes the customs and manners predominating presently and not the customs and manners which were prevalent in antiquity which have now become obsolete. The personal appearance refers to in-person attendance in the Court and if such plea is taken the Court should not compel a pardanashin lady to appear in court for recording her evidence.9. The privilege of exemption in court appearance to a pardanashin lady as provided under Section 132 of C.P.C is to be read with Section 75 and Order 26 Rule 1 C.P.C wherein the Court may appoint commission to record the evidence of pardanashin lady as a matter of right, provided such plea was taken in the pleadings and the court is obligated to determine first whether the exemption claimed is permissible within the purview of Section 132 CPC. 10. In this advanced era of computer age, the information technology is progressing and growing manifold with rapidity. The evidence after proper identification can also be recorded through video link if the facility is available in the court premises or alternately via video call to ascertain whether the pardanashin lady endorsed her signature or thump impression by free will or she was compelled to do this under duress, coercion, fraud, emotional blackmailing or misguidance or to deprive her right or interest in the property or divesting her share in the inheritance]",

The parents divorced in 1987, and the respondent, a minor at the time, was handed over to her mother. In 2012, the respondent filed a suit for maintenance, leading to an interim maintenance order in 2012 and a final decree in 2015. The petitioner contended that he should only be responsible for maintenance if the respondent shows obedience. The court noted that the respondent is an adult and emphasized the need for considering relevant factors in fixing maintenance. The judgment criticized the family court's handling of the case, pointing out flaws in the order and the mechanical dismissal of the petitioner's appeal on the basis of time limitation. It highlighted the legal aspects of maintenance for adult children and emphasized the need for the Family Court to exercise its powers judiciously. The court sets aside previous orders and instructs the Family Court to proceed with the case afresh, considering relevant legal principles and ensuring a fair decision within two months.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail Denied--The petitioner was accused of cyberstalking and sending defamatory messages and photographs of the complainant's daughter-in-law to her husband. The matter was investigated by the Federal Investigating Agency, which secured devices linked to the impugned communication. The petitioner's admission confirmed his involvement, leading to embarrassment for the family.The petitioner sought post-arrest bail, but his attempts were unsuccessful, culminating in an order by a learned Judge-in-Chamber of the Peshawar High Court on October 22, 2021. The petitioner applied for leave to appeal this decision, primarily contending that the alleged offenses did not fall under the prohibitory clause of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, and that since the investigation was complete, there was no justification to deviate from the general rule in favor of granting bail.Upon hearing arguments and reviewing the record, the Supreme Court considered that while it is common for bail to be granted after the conclusion of investigations in cases outside the scope of \"prohibition,\" there are limits to this practice. In this instance, the privacy of a young woman had been violated, leading to significant distress for her family and even jeopardizing her marriage. The incident was reported by her father-in-law. Given the circumstances, the Court was not persuaded by the arguments presented at the bar to take a different view than that taken by the lower courts. Consequently, the petition was rejected, and leave to appeal was denied.",

Specifically, it is argued that respondent No.2 did not provide details of immovable property held outside Pakistan, manipulated information related to business capital, and marked \"Not Applicable\" for the cost of a trust, NWI Family Trust (U.K.). In response, the legal counsel for respondent No.2 argued that the space limitations on the nomination paper justified the use of brackets and alterations in certain sections. They contend that all necessary details were provided in annexures accompanying the nomination paper. The counsel also emphasized that the case precedent cited by the appellant is not applicable to the current situation. After hearing arguments and reviewing the records, the document concluded that the objections raised by the appellant are not substantial and do not warrant the rejection of respondent No.2's nomination paper. The Election Appeal was ultimately dismissed, with the suggestion that more detailed issues could be examined through an Election Petition.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail Cancelled--The High Court's decision rested on the premise that the respondents, who were related as brothers, faced charges in a serious crime intertwined with an existing blood feud. The court acknowledged that while they faced direct charges, two brothers from the same family were accused of committing the murder, with the deceased sustaining both fatal and non-fatal gunshot wounds. The court emphasized that bail decisions should not be isolated but should consider the broader context of the available evidence.The petitioner contested the High Court's findings, asserting that there were valid reasons to hold the respondents accountable for the crime, rendering them ineligible for bail under the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner's representatives argued that the High Court's decision was factually flawed and lacked sound reasoning. The respondents' legal team defended the impugned order, arguing that it fell within the bounds of the High Court's discretion.After reviewing the case, the Supreme Court concluded that the grant of bail should adhere to established legal principles and statutory boundaries. The court found that the evidence provided by the prosecution, which included statements from the complainant, eyewitnesses, and autopsy reports, constituted reasonable grounds to deny bail. The court also noted discrepancies in the crime report regarding the accused individuals' family relationships, raising doubts about the assumption that all accused parties were siblings. The court held that granting bail based on incorrect premises or without following established legal principles could warrant its revocation. The petitioner's application was converted into an appeal and approved, reversing the bail granted by the High Court's order. The respondents were to be taken into custody to face the charges presented before the trial court.",

In the earlier proceedings, the Family Court decided the suit, but it was remanded back by the lower Appellate Court for fresh decision on specific issues. In the subsequent judgment, the Family Court partially ruled in favor of the petitioner, allowing the recovery of 22-Tolas gold ornaments and certain dowry articles. Respondent No.1 appealed, and the Appellate Court partly accepted the appeal, reversing the findings on 22-Tolas gold ornaments. The petitioner argued that the appellate judgment is illegal, emphasizing that bridal gifts are separate from dower and should not be returned. The court examines the entries in the Nikahnama, particularly those related to Haq Mehr and gold ornaments. The court concluded that the gold ornaments (22-Tolas) mentioned in the Nikahnama are bridal gifts and not part of the dower. The court cited the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act, 1976, defining bridal gifts as the absolute property of the bride. It emphasized that bridal gifts cannot be withheld by the husband in the case of Khula, as they are not part of the dower. Additionally, the court addressed the jurisdiction of the Family Court, rejecting the argument that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain claims related to entries in the Nikahnama. In conclusion, the writ petition is allowed, and the appellate judgment is set aside.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Great-grandchildren were not entitled to inherit under section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961----The issue at hand is whether great-grandchildren can be considered \"children\" under section 4 of the Ordinance. This section deals with the distribution of inheritance in case of the death of a son or daughter before the opening of succession. The relevant portion of section 4 states that the children of a deceased son or daughter, who are alive at the time of succession, are entitled to a share equivalent to what the deceased child would have received if alive.The matter arose when a person passed away, leaving behind a residential property. The deceased had several children, including two sons who predeceased them. The grandchildren of one of the predeceased sons, who are the petitioners in this case, claimed a share in the property based on their interpretation of section 4. They argued that the term \"per stirpes\" in the section indicated that if a grandchild of the deceased had also passed away, their children (the great-grandchildren) should inherit the share.The petitioners appealed their case after the lower courts ruled against them. Their argument hinged on interpreting the term \"per stirpes\" as indicating that the lineage of a deceased grandchild should continue through their children, the great-grandchildren. They believed that this interpretation aligned with the intent and spirit of the section.However, the Supreme Court rejected this argument. The Court emphasized that the wording of section 4 clearly limited its applicability to the children of the deceased son or daughter who were alive at the time of the death of the propositus (the deceased person). The Court highlighted that the intention behind section 4 was to create a specific exception to the standard rules of Muslim inheritance, allowing only those grandchildren who were alive at the time of the death to inherit a share. Therefore, the Court ruled that great-grandchildren could not be considered \"children\" under the section and upheld the lower courts' decisions.In conclusion, the Supreme Court dismissed the petitioners' argument and upheld the interpretation that great-grandchildren were not entitled to inherit under section 4 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. The Court emphasized the importance of adhering to the specific wording and intent of the section when interpreting its applicability.",

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) accused the petitioner of running a ponzi or pyramid scheme, defrauding the public of approximately Rs.10.86 billion. The NAB initiated proceedings under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999, and issued notices to the petitioner, requesting information and his appearance. However, the petitioner challenged the legality of the notices in the Islamabad High Court, arguing that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and that the NAB's proceedings amounted to double jeopardy. During the proceedings, the SECP concluded its investigation and referred the matter to the NAB. The High Court dismissed the petitioner's writ petitions, and the petitioner sought leave to appeal in the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court's orders and requesting the same reliefs. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner's arguments, stating that the actions of the petitioner and his family members in their personal capacity, as well as the receipt of money in personal accounts, fell outside the domain of the SECP. The Court found that the NAB had the authority to investigate and proceed against the petitioner under the NAB Ordinance. The Court also concluded that the provisions of the Companies Act and the SECP Act did not bar the NAB's jurisdiction in this case. The Court rejected the petitioner's claim of double jeopardy, explaining that the SECP's penalties were not of a criminal nature, and the offences charged by the NAB were not the same as those charged under the Companies Act. Regarding the petitioner's request for bail before arrest, the Court found no merit and stated that the NAB had collected sufficient evidence to support the allegations against the petitioner. The Court upheld the High Court's decision to dismiss the writ petitions.",

Due to strained relations, the petitioner and respondent No. 2 mutually agreed to divorce on April 23, 2012. Subsequently, respondent No. 2 entered into a second marriage with Muhammad Ikhalq on June 21, 2013.The dispute arose when respondent No. 1 filed an application for his appointment as the guardian of the minor, Muhammad Danial, on September 21, 2015. The application stated that the child had been living with respondent No. 1 since birth, a fact that respondent No. 2 confirmed during her testimony on October 9, 2015. The petitioner submitted a reply to this guardian petition and, on November 14, 2015, filed a guardian petition for the custody of his son under section 25 of the Guardian & Wards Act, 1890.Respondents No. 1 and 2 filed written replies to the petitioner's petitions. Additionally, respondent No. 2 filed a suit for the recovery of maintenance, dower amount, and dowry articles against the petitioner on May 11, 2016.After reconciliation attempts failed, the trial court consolidated the suit and the petitioner's guardian petition on May 29, 2017. The trial court's order, dated June 12, 2017, dismissed the application under section 12 of the Act, allowing the petitioner to meet his son twice a month on certain conditions within the court premises.The petitioner filed a constitutional petition challenging this order. The respondent's counsel argued that the constitutional petition was not maintainable, as appealable orders could be appealed under the Family Courts Act, 1964. The petitioner's counsel contended that the order was not appealable, and therefore, the constitutional petition was competent.The court ruled that the order was appealable before the District Court under the Family Courts Act, 1964. Consequently, the constitutional petition was dismissed. The court also advised the petitioner to file an appeal or repeat the application under section 12 of the Act, as interim custody orders could be modified based on changing circumstances.",

Additionally, he requested that the respondents issue him nomination papers to contest the upcoming elections as a candidate for the Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA) seat in his constituency (Constituency No. PP-113, Faisalabad).The petitioner, Sahibzada Muhammad Hussain Raza, is from a politically influential family, and his father was a former Minister. His brother, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, is a leader of the Sunni Ittehad Council. However, despite being eligible to vote, the petitioner's name was not included in the voter list, which prompted him to file a petition.The petitioner had contacted respondent No. 2 (presumably an official from the Election Commission) on April 26, 2018, and was initially informed that he had a vote in the voter list. However, later, when he checked the voter list, his name was missing. He filed an application on June 5, 2018, before the Provincial Election Commissioner, requesting the inclusion of his vote based on his CNIC, domicile certificate, and family registration certificate. As this application had not been decided, he approached the court by filing this writ petition.The petitioner argued that it was the responsibility of the respondents to include his name in the voter list, especially since other family members were already enrolled voters in the constituency. He mentioned specific sections of the Elections Act, 2017, that empower the Election Commission to amend the electoral roll and enroll eligible voters.On the other hand, the respondent argued that the petitioner had not informed the election commission in a timely manner about his desire to be enrolled as a voter, which was required by Section 39 of the Elections Act, 2017. They also contended that including the petitioner's name at this stage would create logistical issues and burdens on the election commission.After hearing both sides, the court considered various provisions of the Constitution and the Elections Act, 2017. The court concluded that the petitioner, being a citizen of the country with a valid CNIC, was entitled to vote and contest elections. The omission to enroll his vote was not solely his fault, and the responsibility also lay with the Election Commission and the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) to ensure accurate data transmission. The court ordered the immediate enrollment of the petitioner as a voter in his constituency and the issuance of nomination forms for the MPA seat without further delay.This order sheet emphasizes the importance of ensuring that all eligible citizens have the opportunity to vote and participate in the democratic process, especially during the election season.",

The central issue is whether the property was gifted to one of the parties during the lifetime of Ch. Ghulam Ullah or if it should be divided among his legal heirs, particularly his daughters---The witness appeared in court to testify that Ch. Ghulam Ullah, her father, remained the owner of Kothi No.26-C Gulberg II throughout his life. She denied any gifting of the property during his lifetime, disputed the authenticity of certain documents (Ex.D1/1 and Ex.D1/2), and mentioned that her father was an Ahmadi by faith, which, according to Ahmadi practice, does not allow for oral gifts.The witness admitted that a property measuring 6 Kanals in K Block Model Town was owned by her mother, who transferred it to defendant No.1 during her lifetime.Dr. Sabahat Rizvi, another witness, confirmed that Kothi No.26-C Gulberg II was owned by her maternal grandfather, Ch. Ghulam Ullah. She claimed that the signature on the gift deed (Ex.D1/1 and Ex.D1/2) was forged and that her grandfather was Ahmadi, meaning that oral gifts were not permissible in their faith.Witnesses from the defendant's side presented contradictory accounts, with some supporting the claim of an oral gift and others presenting different versions of events.The court observed that the defendant had two contradictory stances in their pleading: one based on a will deed from 1983 and another based on an oral gift from 1991.The court ruled that the alleged gift did not fulfill the legal criteria, such as offer, acceptance, and possession delivery, as required under the Transfer of Property Act. Additionally, the lack of attesting witnesses and registration further undermined the validity of the gift.The court also noted that the defendant's claims of a family settlement through the 1983 will deed and the subsequent gift were self-destructive and lacked merit.The court emphasized that limitation does not apply to co-sharers in inheritance matters, which means that the plaintiffs' suit was not time-barred.Ultimately, the court allowed the appeal and declared the plaintiffs entitled to their 1/2 share in the suit property. The suit for partition filed by the plaintiffs was decreed in their favor.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The convicted individual in the case was tried in a court under charges involving murder, as stipulated in Sections 302/324/337-A/147/148/149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The charges were related to the killing of a person who was a relative of the complainant.After the trial, the convicted individual was found guilty under Section 302(b) of the PPC and sentenced to death. Upon appeal, the High Court upheld the conviction but commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment. This led to the filing of the criminal petitions seeking further appeal and enhancement of the sentence.The prosecution's case alleged that the convicted individual, along with others, had attacked the victim and his family members, resulting in the victim's death. The prosecution presented eyewitness accounts, and the testimonies of these witnesses remained consistent throughout cross-examination. Medical evidence also supported the prosecution's claims.The defense argued that there were contradictions in the prosecution's witnesses' statements and that these witnesses were closely related to the victim. However, the court rejected these arguments, finding the witnesses' accounts reliable and straightforward. The court noted that the convicted individual had been absent for a significant period before the trial, which could account for minor discrepancies in the witnesses' accounts.The Supreme Court heard both sides' arguments and reviewed the evidence. The court found that the prosecution's eyewitness accounts were consistent and reliable. It also noted that minor discrepancies could be attributed to the passage of time and the convicted individual's long absence.The court modified the judgment of the High Court, convicting the individual under a different section of the PPC and sentencing the individual to fourteen years of rigorous imprisonment. The court recognized that the crime was committed in the heat of the moment without premeditation and adjusted the sentence accordingly.As a result, one of the criminal petitions was converted into an appeal and partly allowed, modifying the sentence. The other criminal petition was dismissed.",

The appellant claimed ownership through purchased lands, while the respondents asserted inheritance rights based on family connections.The respondent No. 1 filed a suit for declaration, possession, and injunction regarding the lands. He claimed that his maternal grandfather owned 50% of the lands and that he should inherit them. The lower courts ruled in favor of the respondent No. 1. However, the appellant society argued that the suit was barred by limitation, and the sale of the lands to them was lawful.The Supreme Court considered various factors, including the timing of the suit, the knowledge of the respondent No. 1 about the transactions, and the application of relevant laws. It was noted that the respondent No. 1, by his actions and inactions, seemed to acquiesce in the title of the sellers and had waived his right to the lands. This led the appellant to believe that they were the legitimate owners.The Court invoked Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act, which protects a purchaser who buys property in good faith, for consideration, and without knowledge of any defect in the seller's title. The Court ruled in favor of the appellant, finding that they were entitled to protection under Section 41. The judgment of the Islamabad High Court was set aside.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: [The precedent cases and the best practices regarding the legal position in respect of a test identification parade are consolidated so that any confusion may be removed and all concerned may stand instructed and guided in future.---[Method of Identification parade, prosecution must prove case beyond a reasonable doubt] The precedent cases and the best practices regarding the legal position in respect of a test identification parade are consolidated so that any confusion may be removed and all concerned may stand instructed and guided in future.The case involves an alleged abduction for ransom and murder. The appellant, Asfand Yar Khan, was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder and terrorism charges but acquitted of other charges. In the judgment issued on 12.02.2019, the Supreme Court reviewed the evidence presented in the case. The court found that the prosecution had failed to prove the case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence, such as the last-seen evidence and witness testimonies, lacked the necessary proximity and reliability. The court also highlighted the deficiencies in the test identification parade conducted by Mr. Kanwar Anwaar Ali, a Special Judicial Magistrate. The court noted that the parade violated established legal principles by conducting a joint identification of multiple accused persons. The court criticized Mr. Kanwar Anwaar Ali for his lack of legal knowledge and dereliction of duty. Mr. Kanwar Anwaar Ali appeared before the Supreme Court and provided an explanation for his actions. He stated that he did not have extensive legal education or training, and his knowledge was self-taught. He expressed remorse and requested leniency, considering his career as a civil servant and his responsibilities as a breadwinner for his family. After considering Mr. Kanwar Anwaar Ali's explanation and the circumstances, the Supreme Court discharged the notice issued against him. The court found his explanation plausible and did not find grounds for proceeding against him or making adverse remarks. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of following proper procedures and safeguards in conducting test identification parades. It referred to previous judgments outlining the requirements and standards for holding such parades. The court reiterated the need for separate parades for each accused person and the importance of specifying the role of an individual accused in the offense. Supreme court stated that identification of an accused person before the trial court during the trial is generally considered unsafe, as witnesses may have multiple opportunities to see the accused. The court emphasized the need for witnesses to point out a specific accused person and specify their alleged role.",

Similarly, a pistol and shotgun, admittedly with the deceased and the complainant, lend credence to hypothesis of aggression; renunciation of crime report by the complainant goes a long way to tremor the very basis of his case. Suppression of injuries of an opponent is yet another intriguing circumstance. While the complainant was well within the remit of law to pursue his case through a private complaint, nonetheless, non-examination of investigating officer alongside some other witnesses cannot be countenanced without exposing the accused to a grievous prejudice. Prosecution case is not free from doubt and thus it wasw unsafe to maintain the conviction.---The prosecution's case relied on the testimony of a witness. According to the witness, a series of events took place on the day in question. One individual was reported to have assaulted the daughter of the witness. The witness's pistol fell during the altercation, and the accused allegedly used it. In the midst of this, another individual appeared with a firearm. The individuals involved were from the same family, and a motive for the crime was suggested.The accused were indicted and convicted, with different sentences for each based on their roles. The convictions were upheld by the Lahore High Court, albeit with modifications to the sentences.Despite the narrative presented by the witnesses, certain inconsistencies and shortcomings in the prosecution's case were identified. The familial relationship between the accused raised questions about potential bias, and the presence of firearms added complexity to the sequence of events. The complainant's renunciation of the crime report and the suppression of certain injuries were also noted as significant aspects.The Supreme Court concluded that the prosecution's case was not free from doubt and found it unsafe to maintain the convictions. As a result, the criminal appeal was allowed, and the convictions were set aside. The appellant was ordered to be released, if not required in any other case. The criminal petition for leave to appeal was dismissed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:The appellant appeals against the judgment dated 9.2.2015 of Lahore High Court, which upheld the appellant's conviction and sentence by the Anti Terrorism Court's judgment dated 23.2.2012.The case involves the abduction and subsequent death of Naveed alias Guddu. The appellant, along with co-accused Shahzad, was indicted for the crime. Nadeem Hussain, the third accused, was still at large.Naveed went missing after receiving a phone call on 22.8.2011. A ransom demand of Rs. 500,000 was made, leading to the family's encounter with the appellant at the designated place. Subsequently, the police arrested the appellant on 26.8.2011, and Naveed's dead body was found wrapped in a jute bag.The trial court convicted the appellant under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti Terrorism Act, sentencing him to death on three counts.---Issues:Whether the appellant's confession, which was retracted during trial, was admissible and reliable.Whether the evidence presented by the prosecution sufficiently proved the appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.Whether the quantum of sentence imposed on the appellant was appropriate given the circumstances of the case.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Court found that the appellant's confession, though retracted during trial, was voluntary, truthful, and free from duress or inducement. Therefore, it was admissible and reliable evidence.Considering the evidence presented, including witness testimonies and the appellant's confession, the Court concluded that the guilt of the appellant was established beyond reasonable doubt.While affirming the conviction, the Court modified the sentence, considering that the primary motive behind the crime was ransom extraction rather than premeditated murder. Thus, the death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment on each count, with fines and compensation upheld. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently.The appeal was dismissed with modifications to the quantum of sentence.---Citations/Precedents:Section 7(e) of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997Sections 201, 302(b), 365-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898---Quote:A retracted confession can form basis for conviction if found voluntary and truthful.",

Order of the Executing Court, to the extent of dismissing the execution petition as withdrawn on the basis of compromise was erroneous and did not depict the actual position pertaining to the facts of the case. Executing Court was required to pass an order in terms of statement of parties but it omitted to do so and added the words dismissed as withdrawn. Although presumption of correctness was attached to the judicial acts but such presumption was rebuttable and party could point out defect in the judicial record. Where Court had omitted to pass an order in the manner prescribed by law then the parties could not be penalized for such act or omission of the Court. Decree for maintenance allowance was based on recurring cause of action and the rights of the minors were involved whose execution petition could not even be withdrawn by their mother unless it was established on the record that the withdrawal of execution petition was for the benefit of the minors. Appellate Court had cured the defect and High Court ordinarily did not interfere in the order passed by the Court below which had cured illegality.",

The parties later separated, and the petitioner entered into a second marriage. The courts below had granted custody to Respondent No.3, who is the father, while the petitioner argued that the welfare of the children, particularly the minor daughter, should be considered paramount and that the lap of the mother is the best place for the children. The petitioner cited legal precedents to support her argument.On the other hand, Respondent No.3 contended that he should have custody because the petitioner had remarried and had not provided a suitable environment for the minors. He argued that he could provide better maintenance for the children.The judgment ultimately emphasized that the welfare of the minors is the most crucial factor in determining custody, taking into account various factors such as the age, gender, religion, character, and capacity of the parents. It was noted that the petitioner had remarried, and the father had not, which influenced the decision. The courts below had considered these factors and concluded that the minors' welfare was better served in the custody of their father. Visitation rights were also outlined for the mother to spend time with the children.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: Tanzeela Butt was married to the third respondent on February 3, 2010, with a dower amount of Rs. 50,000, of which Rs. 1,000 was paid initially, and the remaining Rs. 49,000 was deferred. An agreement was also made between the parties, specifying that a house would be transferred to Tanzeela Butt after the third respondent's demise.Divorce and Legal Proceedings: Due to strained relations, the third respondent divorced Tanzeela Butt on June 23, 2011, without paying the deferred dower. He later obtained a consent decree from the Civil Court Sargodha on October 15, 2010, based on an allegedly forged document.Legal Disputes: Tanzeela Butt filed a suit to recover the deferred dower of Rs. 49,000 in the Family Court, Sargodha. The suit was initially dismissed but later allowed on appeal. However, the third respondent appealed again, leading to a series of legal proceedings.Argument of the Petitioner: Tanzeela Butt argued that the judgment was against the law and facts of the case. She maintained that the Agreement and Nikahnama supported her claim to the house. She also contended that the third respondent had prepared a fraudulent document and obtained a consent decree.Ruling of the Court: The Court examined the evidence and found that the Agreement had no legal value in the absence of Tanzeela Butt as a signatory. Furthermore, the Agreement did not specify that the house would be given as dower. The Court also noted that Tanzeela Butt had received a portion of the dower and failed to establish her case.Conclusion: The Court dismissed the writ petition, finding it devoid of merit, and upheld the impugned judgment issued by the respondent. The Court ruled that there was no legal basis for the petitioner's claim to the house as dower.",

However, the respondents (No. 3 and 4) appealed this decision, and it was overturned by the Additional District Judge, Gujrat, on March 3, 2016.The petitioner argues that the appellate court failed to consider that a step-mother should not be preferred over the real mother. She contends that her second marriage should not disqualify her from having custody, especially since respondent No. 3, the father, often remains absent to earn a livelihood.The respondents argue that the petitioner waived her custody rights during a compromise reached in the court of the Judge Family Court, Wazirabad. They claim that her brother is involved in a criminal case, making it unsafe for the minors to stay with her.The judge notes that the welfare of the minors is of utmost importance in custody cases. Documents provided by respondents No. 3 and 4 indicate that the minors are receiving proper care and education under respondent No. 3's care.The judge cites legal precedent indicating that the mother's second marriage can impact custody rights, especially if the step-father is not within a prohibitory degree of relation with the minors.The judge also mentions that the compromise reached in the Judge Family Court, Wazirabad, was binding, and the petitioner was estopped from challenging it.Considering the growing age of the daughter and the financial stability of the parties involved, the judge determines that custody with respondent No. 3 is appropriate.The judge dismisses the petition, allowing the petitioner to file an application for visitation rights as per the observations of the appellate court.",

Despite the rule of thumb, evidence still had to be presented to corroborate any claim. In this case, the petitioner's list of dowry articles was not produced as evidence, and contradictory statements were made about its preparation. The Court underscored that even if the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order's rigorous principles were not in play, evidence was still necessary to support the petitioner's claims.The Court also observed that the list of dowry articles did not adhere to the prescribed format under the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Rules, 1976. The Court further scrutinized the receipts presented by the petitioner, but found them insufficient to establish her claim for dowry articles.Based on these considerations, the Court concluded that the petitioner's claim was unsupported by substantial evidence.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal Allowed---The central dispute in the case revolves around the death of Mst. Saima Kosar, who was married to Muhammad Rizwan. According to the complainant, there were domestic disputes, and Rizwan's family had been mistreating Saima. On August 4, 2013, Saima called her father, Bashir Ahmed, to inform him that she was being expelled from her marital home. Bashir Ahmed, along with some witnesses, went to reconcile the matter and arrived at the scene, where they heard Saima's cries for help. They witnessed an altercation between Abdul Shakoor (who was later acquitted) and Muhammad Rizwan, during which Rizwan fired a shot, fatally injuring Saima.The prosecution argued that this was a case of murder, while the defense contended that it was a case of suicide. The judgment discusses discrepancies in witness statements, including the delay in reporting the incident to the police, and the fact that none of the witnesses tried to apprehend the accused after witnessing the incident. The judgment also points out inconsistencies in the medical and ocular evidence.Ultimately, the court leans toward the view that the death may have been a suicide rather than a homicide. It highlights that the police investigators also believed it to be a case of suicide. The court considers the evidence and principles of benefit of the doubt, concluding that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and, as a result, acquits Muhammad Rizwan.''",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Shabbir Ahmad was married to respondent No.4 under The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and they had minor children. Respondent No.4 filed a suit for the recovery of dower, gold ornaments, and maintenance due to matrimonial disputes. The petitioner resisted the suit, and after various legal proceedings, the Family Court partially decreed the suit in May 2016. Both parties appealed this judgment.The petitioner's counsel argued that the suit should not have proceeded in court since the matter had previously been resolved by the Arbitration Council, and the maintenance awarded was excessive. The petitioner contended that the judgments were legally flawed and the court's jurisdiction had been misused.Conversely, the respondents' counsel argued that there was no illegality in the judgments, and the matter fell under the Family Court's jurisdiction.After reviewing the arguments and the evidence, the judge observed that the proceedings before the Arbitration Council, as per Section 9 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, were an additional legal remedy and did not prevent the suit from being filed in the Family Court. The judge found that the petitioner's contentions were baseless.The judge also ruled on the claims for dower, gold ornaments, and maintenance. Dower and gold ornaments claims were granted, and the maintenance amount was deemed justified. As a result, the petitioner's appeal was dismissed, and the judgment of the Family Court was upheld.In conclusion, the court dismissed Shabbir Ahmad's petition and upheld the judgments of the lower courts.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner's argument revolved around the Shia personal law, stating that divorce under Shia law requires specific Arabic sentences (Seeghajaat) to be read in the presence of two witnesses. He referred to an amendment in Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which stipulated the divorce process for Shia Muslims, emphasizing the importance of pronouncing Talaq in Arabic words in the presence of witnesses.The court considered various precedents and established that under Shia law, the divorce becomes effective when Seeghajaat are read in the presence of witnesses, and the presence of the wife is not mandatory. The court also cited past cases where it was established that Talaq must conform to Shia law's requirements to be valid.In conclusion, the court found that the divorce pronounced by the respondent No.1 did not comply with Shia law's requirements, as it did not involve the reading of Seeghajaat in the presence of witnesses. Therefore, the divorce was not valid under Shia law. The court advised the petitioner to pronounce a fresh Talaq in accordance with Shia law, and the matter should be handled accordingly. The writ petition was disposed of based on these findings.",

On the same day, they also filed an application under Section 21-A of the Act, obtaining a stay order on Rasool's property. Rasool contested the suit, and subsequently, the family court issued the impugned order.The petitioner's argument centered on the timing and necessity of the restraining order under Section 21-A of the Act. He claimed that such an order should only be issued after an interim or final decree and argued that the court had not followed proper procedure. Additionally, he asserted that the application had been filed prematurely, without sufficient evidence of his intent to sell the property.The Assistant Attorney General for Pakistan argued that while the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) does not apply directly to proceedings under the Act, CPC principles can be applied when the Act is silent on certain matters.The judgment emphasized that Section 21-A of the Act should be exercised sparingly and in strict accordance with the law. The court found that the family court had passed the restraining order hastily, based on presumptions and apprehensions rather than concrete evidence of Rasool's intent to sell the property. The court set aside the impugned order, concluding that it was not justified in the given circumstances.The judgment underscored the importance of proving the intent to dispose of property with evidence, and that mere claims or apprehensions are insufficient to pass a restraining order under Section 21-A of the Act.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner had previously approached the Family Court for the dissolution of her marriage, as well as for the recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, and dowry articles. The Family Court had partially granted her requests in a judgment dated March 3, 2016. After the decision, the respondent, Abid Jameel, filed an application under Section 476 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) alleging that certain receipts produced by the petitioner were forged. The application under Section 476 Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the Family Court on March 28, 2016, on the grounds that it was not maintainable.The petitioner challenged this order of the Family Court through a criminal revision, which was decided by the Additional Sessions Judge on October 22, 2016. However, the judge's decision to entertain the criminal revision was found to be erroneous, as it pertained to an order passed by the Family Court, which was not considered an inferior criminal court under Section 435 Cr.P.C. According to Section 14 of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, decisions or decrees passed by a Family Court can be appealed to the High Court or District Court. Therefore, the criminal revision under Section 435/439-A Cr.P.C. was deemed inappropriate.The Court also observed that the order passed by the Family Court was to be challenged under Section 14 of the Family Court Act, as it related to a decision, which was not limited to decrees. Furthermore, the order did not conclude that the receipts were forged, which was a prerequisite for initiating proceedings under Section 476 Cr.P.C. The Court emphasized that such proceedings should not be used as a tool for personal vengeance or settling personal scores. In the absence of evidence supporting the allegations of forgery, the Court set aside the order of the Additional Sessions Judge.In summary, the Court found that the criminal revision was not maintainable, as it pertained to an order of the Family Court and not an inferior criminal court. The order of the Additional Sessions Judge was set aside, and it was determined that the proceedings under Section 476 Cr.P.C. were unwarranted in the absence of evidence supporting the forgery allegations. The Court emphasized the need for a proper legal basis for initiating such proceedings.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The court carefully examined the record and noted that the lower courts' findings varied regarding the recovery of dowry articles and deferred dower. The Family Court decreed the respondent's (the wife's) suit for recovery of dowry articles but dismissed her claim for maintenance allowance and deferred dower. Subsequently, the District Judge modified the judgment and decreed the respondent's right to dowry articles and deferred dower in part, resulting in conflicting conclusions.The court observed that the wife's claim for maintenance allowance and recovery of deferred dower was not supported by cogent and confidence-inspiring evidence. Additionally, it noted that the wife's own statement in her examination-in-chief did not provide clarity on certain aspects of the case. The husband had sought restitution of conjugal rights, demonstrating his willingness to reconcile, but the wife had pursued divorce through Khula. This context led the court to uphold the Family Court's decision to deny maintenance allowance.Regarding deferred dower and dowry articles, the court found the wife's evidence insufficient to prove that the husband had taken these items from her. The husband's statement indicated that the wife had taken away a portion of her gold ornaments when she left the matrimonial home. As there was no compelling evidence that the husband possessed these items, the court upheld the Family Court's findings in this regard.However, concerning dowry articles, the court recognized that the wife was entitled to recover them or their equivalent value as specified in her list. The judgment concluded by partially allowing the writ petition, denying the wife's claim for dower, and granting her the right to recover dowry articles or their alternative value of Rs.3,00,000, without issuing any costs.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Respondent No. 3 originally filed a suit seeking dissolution of marriage, return of dowry articles, and maintenance. The Family Court initially granted her claims, dissolving the marriage, ordering the return of Rs. 60,000 by respondent No. 3 to the petitioner, and awarding maintenance and dowry compensation. Both parties appealed these decisions, and the appeals were consolidated. The appellate court modified the judgments, resulting in the dissolution of marriage and an increase in the dowry compensation from Rs. 1,25,000 to Rs. 1,50,000.Subsequently, respondent No. 3 filed another suit for the recovery of gold ornaments and a third suit for the recovery of personal belongings, both of which were contested by the petitioner. These suits were filed after the earlier judgment and decree. The petitioner claimed that these suits were not maintainable because the earlier suit had already been decided, and according to the principles of res judicata, respondent No. 3 should have raised these claims in the initial suit.In response, respondent No. 3 argued that the principles of res judicata did not apply in family suits and that her claims in the subsequent suits were distinct from those in the original suit. The court examined these arguments and found that res judicata did apply to family suits. The court also noted that respondent No. 3's claims in the subsequent suits overlapped with those in the original suit.Furthermore, the court found inconsistencies and errors in the judgments and decrees of the lower courts, particularly with respect to the nature of the claims and the amounts involved. The judges' decisions seemed inconsistent and lacking in legal acumen. As a result, the court set aside the lower courts' judgments and decrees, dismissing the suit filed by respondent No. 3.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The Appellant/Petitioner had been a resident/tenant of a property within the DHA for more than 24 years and sought permission to be buried in the DHA graveyard. However, their request was denied by the DHA.The central issues in this case revolve around whether land owned by an authority or society for specific purposes can be declared as waqf (an endowment for religious or charitable purposes) or public property, and whether the DHA has the authority to regulate and manage its own land allocated for specific purposes in its master plan.The Appellant/Petitioner argues that the restrictions imposed by the DHA are unreasonable and against their fundamental rights, as well as Shariah (Islamic law). They contend that once land is allocated and used as a graveyard, it becomes consecrated as waqf property and is for the benefit of humanity, and no one, including tenants, should be denied burial rights.On the other hand, the Respondent Authority asserts that the DHA graveyard is its private property, and only registered members and their immediate family can be buried there. They argue that the DHA has the right to regulate its land usage and protect the interests of its members.The court examined the statutory powers of the DHA and its regulations, which provide the DHA with the authority to manage and control the specified area. It found that the DHA has the right to make rules and policies for the proper development and management of the area, including the burial facilities.The court also discussed the concept of waqf and determined that even if the graveyard is considered waqf, it is intended for the benefit of DHA members and their families, and there is no provision to allow public burials.The judgment ultimately upheld the DHA's right to regulate the use of its graveyard and denied the Appellant/Petitioner's request for burial rights in the DHA graveyard. The court found no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgment and dismissed the appeal.",

witnesses---Scope---Accused was charged for committing murder of fatherof complainant by firing---Ocular account of the incident had been furnished bycomplainant/son and widow of the deceased---Complainant mostly reiterated the contents ofhis fard-e-bayan, wherein he had stated that on the day of occurrence, he along with his otherfamily members were present in his house, when the door of the house was knocked by theaccused deceased was prohibited by his mother not to go to the door due to extremeannoyance of accused but despite that deceased went out of, where scuffle took place---Complainant came out from his house, after hearing fire shot and found his father lying inthe pool of blood, while the accused holding pistol in his hand escaped from the place ofoccurrence in a motorcycle---Complainant contradicted his statement as contained in thefard-e-bayan, where he mentioned that on the way to the hospital his father succumbed to theinjuries, while in his court statement he stated that doctor after examination disclosed that hisfather had died---According to complainant at the relevant time the neighbours were gatheredat the spot but neither any neighbour was interrogated nor produced in the Trial Court by theprosecution---Prosecution had failed to produce the persons who had taken the deceased tohospital---Widow of the deceased also contradicted the statement of complainant and statedthat initially her husband was being shifted to a private hospital from where he was beingtaken to civil hospital but on the way to civil hospital he succumbed to the injuries---Widowof deceased in her cross-examination stated that complainant disclosed to her that initiallythe deceased was shifted to private hospital in injured condition and thereafter he was takento civil hospital---Statements of both the said witnesses had fully been contradicted byanother witness, who claimed to be the witness of disclosure of the accused recorded duringinvestigation, wherein allegedly the accused had not only confessed his guilt but also gotrecovered the crime weapon from the roof of the house of deceased---Statements of both thewitnesses were silent that the accused had thrown the pistol on their roof rather they in aspecific terms stated that the accused while holding the pistol escaped from the place ofoccurrence on a motorcycle---Comparative study of both the statements of complainant andwidow and the statement of other witness made the presence of both the witnesses doubtfulat the relevant time and also the recovery of crime weapon on the pointation was doubtful---Circumstances established that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against theaccused beyond any shadow of doubt---Appeal against conviction was allowed,

witness---Scope--- Accusedwas charged for committing murder of father of complainant by firing---In the present case, awitness had claimed to be the witness of disclosure of the accused recorded duringinvestigation, wherein allegedly the accused had not only confessed his guilt, but also gotrecovered the crime weapon from the roof of the house of deceased---Record showed that thealleged recovery of crime weapon was effected after 20-days of incident from the roof of thehouse of complainant party, thus, it was beyond imagination that the said pistol remained onthe roof of complainant party and no one had seen it and even after 20-days its condition wasnot deteriorated---Even otherwise, the Investigating Officer admitted in his crossexamination that the alleged recovery of pistol was not effected in his presence---Circumstances established that the prosecution had failed to prove its case against theaccused beyond any shadow of doubt---Appeal against conviction was allowed,

murder of father ofcomplainant by firing---In the present case, both the complainant and widow of deceased inspecific terms stated in their statements that on hearing the firing shots, when they came outfrom their house, they had seen the accused holding pistol in his hand---Admittedly both thesaid witnesses were also on the target of accused, but he let them free and escaped from theplace of occurrence---Said fact did not appeal to the logic that by killing a person in presenceof his blood relations, the accused being armed with sophisticated weapon would not attemptto cause any injury/kill the prosecution witnesses leaving them for evidence to be hanged---Ocular testimony of the related/interested prosecution witnesses and false implication of theaccused by the witnesses could not be ruled out of consideration as the accused whilerecording his statement under S.342, Cr.P.C., had taken specific plea of his false implicationby witnesses---Circumstances established that

Nazir Ahmad appealed to the District Judge, but the appeal was also dismissed, leading to the filing of this revision petition. The petitioners argued that the lower courts had made mistakes in their assessment of the alleged partition deed (Ex.P-1) and that the evidence supported its existence.The Lahore High Court reviewed the judgments and decrees of the lower courts and found that they had upheld the trial court's findings. The court noted issues with Ex.P-1, including the fact that it had not been affirmed by a Revenue Officer, as required by the law. Ultimately, the Lahore High Court concluded that there were no legal errors or irregularities in the lower courts' judgments and decrees. It held that the lower courts had correctly applied the law and considered the evidence. Therefore, the revision petition was dismissed, and no costs were awarded to either party.",

From the evidence and confessional statement of the accused it clearly transpires that the appellant in a cool and calculated manner wanted to kill his father, mother, two sisters and four brothers by firing while they were sleeping due to tranquillizer administered by him and they had no occasions to give any resistance whatsoever. The record clearly shows that the learned Magistrate told the appellant that he was not bound to make a confession and that if he confessed that confession would be used against him and he also told the appellant that he was appearing before a Magistrate and he also asked him that nobody has forced him in making the statement to which the appellant replied that he has recorded his statement with his own free consent. The medical evidence proved that the appellant gave Tranquillizer in the tea to his family members and by satisfying himself that they are not in their senses, he committed their murder.

Mst. Amena Gulnaz was convicted under Section 302(c) of the PPC and sentenced to fourteen years of simple imprisonment. She was also ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 1,00,000 to the legal heirs of the deceased. Her co-accused, Allah Ditta and Ijaz Hussain, were acquitted due to the benefit of doubt, and no appeal was filed against their acquittal. The motive alleged by the prosecution was a domestic dispute between Abu Bakar and Allah Ditta's family. However, the court found discrepancies in the prosecution's version, including inconsistencies in witness statements regarding the distance to the crime scene and variations in the motive presented. The medical evidence supported the fact that Abu Bakar sustained injuries, but it could not identify the assailant. Additionally, the recovery of a pistol at the appellant's instance and a positive report from the Forensic Science Laboratory were considered, but their evidentiary value was diminished due to delays in the process. Ultimately, the trial court rejected the prosecution's version of events and relied on the appellant's statement, where she admitted to shooting Abu Bakar in response to a claim that he had raped her at gunpoint. The court, however, acquitted the appellant, as it believed that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In conclusion, the appellant, was acquitted of the murder charge due to the prosecution's failure to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt, even though she had admitted to the killing in her statement.",

This initial suit was dismissed by both the Family Court and the Appellate Court, as it was deemed premature since the marriage was still intact. Subsequently, the petitioner filed a written statement, and several issues were framed, including whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover dowry articles and whether the suit was barred by the principle of res judicata. The petitioner argued that since the earlier suit had been dismissed, respondent No. 3 could not file a fresh suit on the same subject matter, citing Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which prohibits a second suit between the same parties on the same subject matter. The central legal question in the case was whether the principle of res judicata, as defined in Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, applied. This section prevents the re-challenging of a matter that has already been directly and substantially decided in a previous suit between the same parties. The court determined that the litigation was no longer under the same title because the parties were now ex-wife and ex-husband, and the nature of their claims had changed. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition, finding it to be meritless.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In the original suit, the appellant sought to recover one Coror as damages due to alleged mental torture suffered during a legal proceeding initiated by respondent No.1 for the maintenance of a minor. The appellant, who was the grandfather of the minor, had been included as a defendant in the maintenance suit at one point but was later removed as a defendant. The trial court, after hearing both parties and considering the evidence, granted a partial decree in favor of the appellant for Rs.10,000, noting that he had faced humiliation when receiving a summons related to the family suit, and this had damaged his reputation. The appellant, dissatisfied with the amount awarded, filed this appeal, arguing that the trial court should have granted the full claimed amount of damages. The appellate court examined the case and found certain critical aspects had not been considered by the trial court. Firstly, it noted that the maintenance suit was filed through the minor's mother as the next friend, and the appellant was not the target of the suit. Secondly, it highlighted a statement in the maintenance suit's plaint that mentioned the father's absence and lack of information about his whereabouts. The appellant had filed an application for custody of the minor in the same legal proceeding, indicating that he was not entirely opposed to being involved in the case. Therefore, the appellate court concluded that the appellant's complaint of damage to his reputation due to his inclusion in the suit lacked merit. It held that the appellant had instituted multiple lawsuits against the respondents, and his claim of damage to his reputation was unsubstantiated. The appeal filed by the appellant was dismissed, and the partial decree of Rs.10,000 granted by the trial court was set aside. The court ruled that the appellant's suit did not disclose a cause of action against the respondents.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case originated from an incident where respondents No.3 to 8 allegedly used weapons to assault the petitioner's family members, resulting in injuries. The petitioner filed an FIR, which led to the trial and conviction of the respondents under the relevant sections of the PPC. The petitioner's counsel contends that the judgments are illegal and unlawful, arguing that the petitioner has provided substantial evidence to prove the respondents' guilt. On the other hand, the respondents' counsel argues that the constitutional petition is not maintainable against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge and that there are contradictions in the prosecution's evidence. The judgment sheet goes on to address the issue of maintainability, citing legal precedents that suggest that a writ petition is generally not maintainable against an order passed by an Additional Sessions Judge in a criminal revision. It noted that the normal punishment for cases of hurt under the PPC is the payment of Arsh or Daman, and imprisonment is an optional additional punishment that can be imposed only under specific circumstances, such as when the offender is a previous convict, habitual criminal, or the offense was committed in the name of honor. The judgment finds that there is no evidence to suggest that the respondents fall into these categories, and therefore, the lower courts' judgments were appropriate. Consequently, the constitutional petition was dismissed by the Lahore High Court, and the judgments of the lower courts are upheld.",

The complainant, alleged that the appellant and his co-accused murdered his son due to multiple motives, including a land dispute and a family dispute over a potential marriage proposal. The prosecution's case relied heavily on circumstantial evidence, including eyewitness accounts, extrajudicial confessions, medical evidence, and the recovery of a firearm. However, the court found several inconsistencies and weaknesses in the prosecution's case. It questioned the reliability of the evidence of last seen, the alleged motives, and the credibility of the witnesses. Additionally, the court noted discrepancies in the inquest report and the location of evidence. Ultimately, the court concluded that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt against the appellant and acquitted him, extending the benefit of doubt. As a result, Criminal Appeal was accepted, and the appellant was ordered to be released if not required in any other case.",

The underlying lawsuit had been filed in a representative capacity under Order I, Rule 8, C.P.C. by individuals belonging to different tribes against members of other tribes. Noor Khan alleged that the judgment and decree had been obtained through fraud and misrepresentation. However, the Court pointed out that the burden of proving these allegations rested entirely on him and that he had not provided sufficient and specific details as required by Order VI, Rule 4, C.P.C.The Court also noted that proper publication in the newspaper had been carried out before proceeding with the case, indicating that the legal requirements for a representative suit had been met. Noor Khan's attempt to justify the 17-year delay in filing the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. by claiming a lack of knowledge was undermined when it was revealed that his uncle was a party to the judgment and decree. Furthermore, Noor Khan failed to meet the criteria of an aggrieved person, as he had not presented any revenue record or relied on any documents to establish his standing to file the application under section 12(2), C.P.C. The Court cited the Happy Family Associate v. Pakistan International Trading Company case (PLD 2006 SC 226), which emphasized that section 12(2) and section 151, C.P.C., should not be used as substitutes for regular appeal, revision, or review and should not be resorted to unnecessarily to frustrate decrees or their execution. Given these considerations, the Constitutional petition filed by Noor Khan was found to lack merit and was consequently dismissed by the Court.",

After trial and appeal, the current Civil Revision petition challenges the lower courts' judgments and decrees. The petitioner argued that the entries in the Nikah Nama are based on collusion and malafide and that the courts failed to consider the alleged tampering of crucial documents. Additionally, they contest the jurisdiction of the Family Court to adjudicate matters related to immovable property given as dower, asserting that such disputes should be resolved in the Civil Court. The court examined the evidence, emphasizing that when immovable property is documented as dower in the Nikah Nama, it becomes the property of the wife. It asserted that the deceased husband's lack of objection during his lifetime strengthens the credibility of the dower claim. The court relied on legal precedence and concluded that the judgments of the lower courts are in line with the evidence and the law. Moreover, it dismissed the petition, noting that the Family Court holds the jurisdiction to decide on dower matters, whether movable or immovable. The court also highlighted the lack of statutory provision for revision against judgments of the Appellate Court in the Family Courts Act, and subsequently dismissed the petition for lacking merit. The court dismissed the Civil Revision petition, upholding the lower courts' judgments regarding the dower property claimed by the respondent.",

Additionally, the court raised doubts about the alleged extra-judicial confessions, considering them weak evidence without sufficient corroboration. The Lahore High Court concluded that the prosecution's circumstantial evidence did not inspire confidence and lacked the necessary corroboration. The court emphasized the importance of reliable evidence in criminal cases, especially when based on circumstantial evidence. As a result, the appeal was dismissed as devoid of merit, upholding the acquittal of the respondents.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal allowed---The Accountability Court had convicted and sentenced the appellant under Section 10 of the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, to 8 years of rigorous imprisonment along with fines. The accusations revolved around his accumulation of substantial assets and properties that appeared to be disproportionate to his known sources of income. As a result, an investigation was conducted, which uncovered various assets, including foreign exchange certificates, properties, and bank accounts held by the appellant and his family members. It was found that these assets were obtained through corrupt practices and corruption, which led to the charges and convictions. The appellants were charged under Section 10 of the NAB Ordinance for corruption and corrupt practices due to their disproportionate wealth.The appellant, denied the allegations against him, particularly related to a deposit of US Dollars 1,27,277 by his family members in Deutsche Bank for obtaining a loan of Rs. 8.6 million. He claimed that the amount was from legitimate sources and used to adjust a loan in a Pak rupee account. Another appellant, also denied the allegations, stating that he was falsely implicated by the investigating officer. The defense raised several contentions, including defects in the framing of charges, improper conduct of the investigation, and failure to fulfill legal requirements in questioning the accused. They also argued that the prosecution did not establish that the assets of the accused were beyond their known sources of income. The court noted that the charges were defectively framed, and it was not clear from the prosecution's case that the accused had to explain the source of their income beyond the known sources. The court emphasized that the burden of proving the known source of income primarily falls on the prosecution before shifting to the accused to explain their resources. The court found that there was a lack of evidence regarding the misuse of authority by the accused to earn ill-gotten money or to build up assets illegally. Additionally, the prosecution did not adequately address the known source of income of the accused. The court also highlighted that the prosecution failed to provide any order by the Chairman of NAB declaring two witnesses as approvers, a requirement under the law. The court ultimately found legal deficiencies in the case and emphasized the need for the prosecution to prove the known source of income before shifting the burden to the accused. The court found that the prosecution failed to establish a clear connection between the properties and ill-gotten money, and there was insufficient evidence to support the forfeiture of these assets. The court also criticized the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for not properly investigating the sources of funds used to purchase these properties and emphasized the importance of transparently probing corruption to benefit national interests. Ultimately, the appeals were allowed, the conviction was overturned, and the properties were released. The appellants were acquitted, and their bail sureties were discharged.",

In contrast, the counsel for respondent No.3 argued that the decree was based on evidence, and the petitioner's negligence should not excuse their failure to appear at the hearings. The case timeline reveals that the suit was initially filed by respondent No.3, and ex-parte proceedings occurred when the petitioner failed to appear for a pre-trial reconciliation proceeding. The petitioner subsequently attempted to set aside the ex-parte decree, but their application was dismissed by the court. The court also referenced a warning issued by the Disciplinary Committee of the Punjab Bar Council to the petitioner's counsel, which was related to this case. The judge sets aside the order dismissing the petitioner's application and remands the case to the Family Court in Lahore. The petitioner is required to pay a specified amount to respondent, which may be adjusted as maintenance allowance. The Family Court is instructed to proceed expeditiously and make a decision, preferably within three months of receiving a copy of the order.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case revolves around the marriage between the petitioner and respondent No. 3, contracted under the Shia sect of Islam in 2013 and registered with Union Council No. 59 in Lahore. After their marriage encountered difficulties, respondent No. 3, exercising her delegated powers of divorce according to the Nikahnama, issued an undated divorce deed and sent it to respondent No. 2. The petitioner challenged this divorce through a legal suit in 2014. The petitioner argued that respondent No. 2 lacked territorial jurisdiction to handle the divorce case under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, as the Union Council No. 59 was not the place of residence of respondent No. 3. The petitioner also contended that, according to the Shia interpretation of Islamic law, divorce only takes place when specific conditions (\"Segheas\" in Arabic) are met in the presence of both parties. Conversely, respondent No. 3's counsel argued that the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance was enacted to protect women's rights and should be interpreted accordingly. They assert that previous court decisions cited by the petitioner do not override the legislative intent of facilitating divorce for women. They also presented a Fatwa issued by Dar-ul-efta & Shareat Board, which confirms that the necessary conditions for divorce were met. After hearing both arguments, the court concluded that the notice of divorce should be sent to the Union Council where the Nikah was registered, as it is considered the place of residence of the wife. The court finds no illegality in the certificate issued by respondent No. 2 and dismisses the petitioner's constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The case involves a dispute over the jurisdiction and legality of a divorce certificate issued in a Shia marriage, with the court ultimately ruling in favor of the certificate's validity.",

The judgment sentenced him to seven years of rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 25,00,000. Additionally, six different properties were forfeited to the Government, leading to his disqualification from public office for ten years after serving the sentence. The case revolved around allegations that, during his tenure as a Junior Clerk at the D.C. Office, Lahore, from 1966 to 2000, Sardar Muhammad Naseem had engaged in corrupt activities and acquired properties in his name and his dependents' names that exceeded his known source of income. Several properties were listed in the case as being acquired by him and his family members. The court found that the prosecution had only successfully proven four out of the eight properties alleged to have been purchased or acquired by the appellant. It was noted that the prosecution failed to adequately investigate the appellant's sources of income and did not issue notices to alleged Benamidars (those holding property on behalf of others) before confiscating the properties, which was a critical omission. The judgment ultimately acquitted the appellant of all charges, set aside the trial court's decision, discharged his sureties, and released the confiscated properties. The court criticized the trial court for not thoroughly examining the appellant's income and expenses and not providing a proper formula for assessing assets beyond means.",

The FIR alleges that the petitioner, was involved in a case of abduction and theft of gold ornaments, cash, and household articles. The petitioner's counsel argues that the FIR is based on false and fabricated facts. They claim that the petitioner never contracted a \"Nikah\" (marriage) with the complainant/respondent No. 4 and that she had actually married a person named Saif-ul-Malook. The petitioner's counsel also highlighted that the petitioner had voluntarily recorded her statement before a court, expressing her desire to live with her husband Saif-ul-Malook. They argued that the petitioner's rights to marriage and family life, as protected by Article 35 of the Constitution, are being violated. On the other hand, counsel for respondent No. 4 argues that the petitioner is misusing pre-arrest bail and that her \"Nikah\" with Saif-ul-Malook is a forged document. They contend that the petitioner herself had previously filed a suit for the dissolution of her marriage, admitting that she had entered into a marriage with the complainant/respondent No. 4. The Assistant Advocate General opposes the petition, stating that the FIR should not be quashed, especially since the challan (charge sheet) has been submitted to the trial court. Ultimately, the court dismisses the petition, citing the principle of res judicata (a matter already judged) and the fact that the trial is ongoing, with the petitioner having the option to seek premature acquittal under the relevant sections of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C).",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Mst. Amna had filed a suit in 1989 seeking a declaration of her inheritance rights to certain property, claiming a 1/5th share. The defendants, who were her brothers, contested the suit, arguing that their father had died in 1940 and that customary law of inheritance applied, which excluded their sister from inheriting the property. They claimed that any partition claims were related to their own property, not Mst. Amna's. The critical issue in the case revolved around whether the property had been inherited under customary law or Muslim Family Law of Inheritance. The trial court ruled in favor of the defendants, emphasizing that the plaintiff had not proven her entitlement under Muslim Family Law and had failed to produce relevant documents. The revision petition argued that the Addl. District Judge had made a material error in setting aside the trial court's judgment, and the judgment was not based on solid evidence or logical reasoning. The High Court agreed with the revision petitioner's argument, finding that the plaintiff had not adequately proved her entitlement, and the judgment of the trial court should stand. In conclusion, this legal document describes a revision petition against a property inheritance dispute case, focusing on the conflicting claims of inheritance based on customary law and Muslim Family Law. The High Court accepted the revision petition, ultimately dismissing the plaintiff's suit.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail denied---CrPC allowed an accused person to seek post-arrest bail if they have been in custody for more than two years continuously and if they are not considered a hardened, desperate, or dangerous criminal. The case involved an honor killing, where the petitioner was implicated in the murder of his own daughter. The court considered whether the act of killing one's own daughter in the name of honor constituted an act of a desperate and dangerous criminal. The court observed that such acts, where family members are involved in honor killings, must be strongly condemned. Granting post-arrest bail in such cases could lead to an increase in such incidents, and it would not be in line with the principles of justice and protecting women's rights. In this particular case, the girl had been murdered for contracting a marriage of her choice, and the court noted the brutal nature of the crime. Consequently, the court refused to grant post-arrest bail to the petitioner, stating that doing so would not be in the interest of justice. The petitioner's request for post-arrest bail was dismissed, and the court upheld the principle that honor killings should not be tolerated in society.",

The lower courts awarded Rs. 70,000/- as the alternate price for the dowry articles, considering wear and tear and the financial status of the petitioner's parents. The petitioner argued that the valuation of the dowry articles was too low, given the short duration of the marriage. The respondent's counsel countered by stating that a buffalo was given to the petitioner's parents in exchange for the dowry articles. The High Court noted that wear and tear on dowry articles depended on various factors, including the nature and quality of the items, their use, the relationship between the spouses, and the period of use. The court stated that there is no generalized formula to determine wear and tear precisely. It suggested methods for ascertaining wear and tear, such as physical verification through video calls, video footage, photographs, or employing modern technology. The court also recommended the appointment of a local commission for verification. Ultimately, the High Court allowed the writ petition, setting aside the previous judgments and directing the Family Court to reassess the tentative value of the dowry articles using one of the suggested methods.",

Additionally, respondent No.2 had filed an application for the custody of their minor children. After a series of legal proceedings, including the Family Court's decision to grant the petitioner a decree for dowry articles to the extent of a specific list, the matter was appealed. The petitioner's counsel argued that the appellate court should not have granted the full dowry articles without proper evidence, while respondent No.2's counsel contended that some items were admitted by the petitioner and therefore should be considered part of the dowry. The court found that the burden of proof regarding the return of dowry articles lay with the petitioner and that some of the dowry articles were indeed not retained by them, as per their written statement. The court excluded the claim for 25-tolas of gold ornaments but included a television and sewing machine in the list of dowry articles or set their tentative value at Rs. 1,00,000. This legal case involved a dispute over dowry articles and custody of minors, ultimately resulting in the adjustment of the dowry articles claimed by the parties involved in the case.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The petitioner claimed that these dowry articles were given at the time of her marriage to the respondent, but she was later turned out by him, and he retained the dowry articles. Initially, the Family Court had awarded a monthly maintenance allowance to Kalsoom Bibi and her child, along with maternity charges and the recovery of dowry articles or their price. However, the respondent filed an appeal, and the appellate court set aside the recovery of dowry articles while upholding the maintenance allowance. In this constitutional petition, the petitioner argued that she had provided substantial evidence regarding the financial status of the respondent, the description of the dowry articles, and the cultural custom of giving dowry. The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and noted that the respondent's defense was primarily an evasive denial. The petitioner and her father provided details about the dowry articles, and her father testified about his financial capacity to provide dowry. The court also considered the number of guests at the wedding and the custom of giving dowry in rural societies. Ultimately, the court reversed the findings of the appellate court, holding that the list of dowry articles (Ex-P1) was sufficient evidence, and the absence of receipts was not unusual in rural societies. The court decreed the suit for the recovery of dowry articles or their price at Rs. 1,00,000/- while upholding the maintenance allowance awarded by the Family Court.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The background of the case is that the petitioner and respondent No.2 were married in 1988 with certain financial arrangements, and they had a child named Muhammad Umair Tayyab. However, their relationship deteriorated, and respondent No.2 contracted a second marriage. The petitioner had previously filed various legal actions, including a suit for maintenance allowance and dowry articles, as well as appeals and writ petitions related to these matters. The main point of contention in this document is whether a DNA test is necessary to determine the parentage of Muhammad Umair Tayyab, who is now over 18 years old. The document cited relevant legal provisions, including Section 128 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, which deals with the presumption of legitimacy of a child born during a valid marriage. The document also references previous legal cases and their implications for the use of DNA tests in such situations. Ultimately, the document concluded by allowing the writ petition, setting aside the order for a DNA test, and directing the parties to continue their case before the learned Judge Family Court, where it is still pending.",

The petitioner argues that the respondent did not initially include these witnesses in the list appended with the plaint, hence claiming that such an application is not maintainable under the Family Courts Act, 1964.The judgment delves into the interpretation of Section 7 of The Family Courts Act, 1964, stating that the provision allows for the calling of witnesses at a later stage with the court's permission, if deemed necessary in the interest of justice. The judgment highlights that the Act doesn't specify consequences for non-compliance, implying a discretionary aspect for the court to decide the matter based on the requirement of justice.The judgment also distinguishes the application of The Family Courts Act, 1964 from the Civil Procedure Code, emphasizing the discretion vested with the Family Court. It cites previous cases supporting the court's power to permit the inclusion of witnesses even if not initially listed, provided it serves the interest of justice.Ultimately, the judgment rules that the impugned order was passed in the interest of justice and did not prejudice either side. Hence, the writ petition is dismissed, indicating that the order in question is an interim one and not illegally prejudicial to warrant intervention via constitutional jurisdiction.",

The petitioner argued that the Family Court had no authority to close his right of defense, but the court disagreed, stating that while there is no explicit provision in the Family Courts Act of 1964 allowing the closure of a party's defense, the court can take such action to promote the ends of justice. The court noted that the petitioner had ample opportunities to submit a written statement but failed to do so. Ultimately, the court found no merit in the petitioner's case and dismissed the petition, emphasizing that the petitioner's conduct had hindered the legal process.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The background of the case involved Mst. Shaista Jabin filing two separate suits against Wahab Ahmad, one for maintenance and restitution of conjugal rights and another for recovery of dowry articles. The Family Court consolidated these suits and framed consolidated issues. During the proceedings, Mst. Shaista Jabin applied to include additional witnesses in the list, which the petitioner, Wahab Ahmad, opposed. The key legal issue revolved around whether the Family Court had the authority to permit the inclusion of witnesses not initially listed in the plaint. Section 7 of The Family Courts Act, 1964 was cited, which allows parties to call witnesses at a later stage with the court's permission if it is deemed expedient in the interest of justice. The court concluded that the provision in section 7 of The Family Courts Act, 1964 was not rigid and allowed for the inclusion of witnesses later on if it served the interests of justice. It distinguished this provision from the corresponding provision in the Civil Procedure Code, emphasizing the discretionary nature of the Family Court's authority. The court also highlighted that the Family Courts Act aimed to provide a speedy mechanism for resolving family disputes and was exempt from certain procedural rigors, making it adaptable to the needs of the case. In the end, the court upheld the Family Court's order, stating that it was issued for the advancement of justice and did not prejudice either party. The writ petition was dismissed.",

The petitioner failed to pay the dower and maintenance allowance, and subsequently, the plaintiff filed a suit to recover these amounts. The court, after considering the arguments, noted that the claim of the respondent No.3 did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Family Court and was a contractual obligation. The court further mentioned that any condition imposed in the Nikahnama (Islamic marriage contract) for the award of damages in case of divorce was against the basic principles of law and marital ties. It followed the precedent set in another case, (2008 SCMR 186), and held that parties in a marriage should not be bound by stringent conditions to remain in the marital bond. Based on these findings, the court allowed the writ petition, setting aside the judgments and decrees of the trial court and appellate court. The suit filed by the respondent No.3 for the recovery of damages of Rs. 100,000/- as compensation for divorce was dismissed.",

The accused were charged with murder and other related offenses.During the trial, the witnesses' accounts were inconsistent and lacked credibility. The identification parade proceedings were also flawed, with some witnesses not being able to identify the accused. The recovery of weapons and other evidence from the accused was questionable, as they were allegedly kept in illegal custody prior to the arrests.Based on these doubts and contradictions in the prosecution's case, the Lahore High Court acquitted all the appellants, setting aside their convictions and sentences. The court held that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the appellants were acquitted of the charges. The death sentence awarded to Shoaib Habib and Saqlain Abbas was not confirmed, and they were ordered to be released if not required in any other case.",

The petitioner's argument was based on a contradiction in the respondent's pleadings and statements. However, the petitioner argued that the respondent had left these ornaments at his house when she went to her parents' house. The petitioner contended that the trial court did not frame the issue properly, and as a result, the evidence was not properly focused on the dispute regarding the quantity and possession of the gold ornaments. The Lahore High Court found that this was indeed a case of misreading of evidence and that the issue was not framed properly, leading to incorrect findings. The court cited a precedent that stated that a writ of \"Certiorari\" could be issued in cases where findings of fact were based on legally inadmissible evidence, where admissible evidence was not accepted, or where findings were not supported by any evidence at all. As a result, the court set aside both orders below relating to the issue of gold ornaments and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to reframe the issue and decide the case within two months. However, the issue of maintenance was not found to have jurisdictional defects or errors of law, so the petition was dismissed in that regard.",

The trial court summoned the respondents, but some absented themselves and were declared proclaimed offenders. After a trial, the respondents were acquitted by the learned Magistrate.In the Lahore High Court, the only argument put forth by the petitioner's counsel was that the trial court wrongly focused on the issue of possession while acquitting the respondents of the charge under section 440 PPC. However, the judge, after reviewing the evidence and arguments, was not convinced. The judge stated that the possession of the property was continuously with the respondents, and the petitioner's ownership was yet to be decided in the civil litigation pending between the parties. Without establishing wrongful loss or damage caused by the respondents, the charge of mischief under section 440 PPC could not be proven. The judge upheld the trial court's judgment, refused leave to appeal, and dismissed the petition as devoid of merits.",

Appeal No. 1825 of 2010 involves Razia Sultana, who was tried by the Special Court, CNS, Lahore, in a case registered under the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997. She was accused of possessing narcotics, including 10 kilograms of charas on her person and facilitating the recovery of additional charas, gardacharas, and opium from her residential room.During the trial, formal charges were framed against the accused, and the prosecution presented four witnesses, including police officers and the Investigating Officer, to establish the charges. The appellant denied the allegations, claiming that the raid was originally meant for her tenant, Muhammad Akram, who escaped during the operation. She further accused the Investigating Officer of falsely implicating her.The defense raised several contentions, including the legality and validity of the recovery proceedings, lack of search warrants, and the alleged involvement of other family members residing in the house where the recovery took place. The defense also challenged the absence of a crucial witness, Imtiaz Hussain Constable, who was responsible for transmitting samples to the Chemical Examiner's office.However, the court found the prosecution's evidence convincing and the defense's claims unproven. The court upheld the trial court's judgment, dismissing the appeal, and concluded that the appellant's involvement in the offense was established beyond doubt. The conviction and sentence were upheld.",

Recovery of Dower---The background of the case involved the petitioner's marriage to respondent No. 3, followed by the expulsion of respondent No. 3 four months into the marriage. The petitioner claimed that respondent No. 3 took her dowry articles and demanded maintenance. The petitioner's argument revolved around the interpretation of Section 7 of the West Pakistan Family Court's Act, asserting that no maintenance claim could be granted without a suit for dissolution of marriage. The petitioner also challenged the authenticity of the dowry articles and gold ornaments, contending that they were taken by respondent No. 3 in his absence. On the other hand, the respondent's counsel argued that the objection regarding the consolidated prayer was not raised earlier, and that a claim for dowry articles and maintenance could be made together. They also pointed out contradictions in the petitioner's statements. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioner, setting aside the judgments and allowing respondent No. 3 to recover Rs. 1,20,000 worth of dowry articles (already deposited by the petitioner) and maintenance at the rate of Rs. 1,000 per month during the subsistence of the marriage. No costs were awarded. The court partially ruled in favor of the petitioner, allowing the recovery of a specified amount of dowry articles and maintenance.",

The petitioner's father, served in the respondent department for approximately 26 years and retired on medical grounds in 2013. The petitioner applied for an appointment as a Fisheries Watcher BS-1, a position vacated by his father, invoking Rule 17-A of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974. However, the appointment was denied based on the petitioner's Matriculation result, which was in the third division. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of Rule 17-A, as his father was the family's sole source of livelihood and has been retired on medical grounds. The counsel asserted that the petitioner should be dealt with in accordance with the law, as guaranteed by Article 4 of the Constitution of Pakistan. The court, after considering the arguments and the relevant rules, determines that the petitioner's Matriculation certificate, which shows grade-E, does not specifically disqualify him under Rule 17-A of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment and Condition of Service) Rules, 1974. Additionally, the court observed that there is no other competitor for the said post, and the rule should be interpreted to provide benefit to the petitioner. Therefore, the court directed respondent No.3 to consider the petitioner for his appointment under Rule 17-A and not disqualify him based on his educational qualification.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Sajjad Akhtar Kiani filed a petition seeking post-arrest bail in a case registered against him under section 489-F, PPC (Pakistan Penal Code). The case was based on a complaint that he had issued a cheque worth Rs. 4,300,000/-, drawn on Faisal Bank, which had been dishonored thrice due to insufficient funds.The petitioner's counsel argued that there was a civil suit in which the complainant, who was the petitioner's sister, had received her share from the family's property in the form of money. The petitioner issued the cheque as part of this arrangement, and the police investigation had found him innocent. The petitioner requested bail since the challan (charge sheet) had already been submitted, and his presence was no longer required for further investigation.On the other hand, the complainant's counsel contended that the petitioner was guilty, and the complainant had been deprived of her rightful share of the property. The counsel argued that the cheque had been issued without any business deal as a guarantee and requested the dismissal of the bail petition.After hearing the arguments and examining the available record, the judge found that the case involved a dispute over inheritance share, which fell under the domain of the civil court. The judge noted that the dishonest intention to issue the cheque was not apparent, and it seemed to have been issued as security rather than to discharge any liability. The investigating officer's report also favored the petitioner.Relying on precedents, the judge granted bail to Sajjad Akhtar Kiani, emphasizing that the case fell within the non-prohibitory clause, and bail should be granted unless there were exceptional circumstances. The bail was set at Rs. 10,000,000/-, and the petitioner was required to furnish two sureties in the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.",

However, the court disagreed, stating that the petitioner could challenge the ex-parte judgment by filing an application to set it aside or by filing an appeal. The court cited Section 14 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which outlined the appeal process against decisions or decrees passed by a Family Court. The court clarified that there was no mention of a suit for jactitation of marriage in Section 14(2) of the Act, and as such, the petitioner's case fell under Section 14(b), making it appealable to the District Court. The court referred to a previous case ruling, stating that the appropriate remedy against the dismissal of a suit on the question of jactitation of marriage was through an appeal to the District Judge. Therefore, since the petitioner had an alternate remedy available in the form of an appeal, the writ petition was deemed not maintainable and was dismissed by the court.",

The background of the case involved the petitioner filing a composite suit for maintenance, dowry articles, and dower, while respondent No. 3 filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. The trial court issued a judgment and decree which granted maintenance to the petitioner but dismissed her claims for gold ornaments, buffaloes, cows, and dower. The petitioner appealed the decision to the higher court (respondent No. 1) but was unsuccessful, leading to the current writ petition. The petitioner's counsel argued that both lower courts erred in law by not awarding the dower amount despite the husband's second marriage without the first wife's permission. They cited section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which states that a husband must immediately pay the entire amount of dower to the first wife in such cases. After examining the evidence and relevant legal provisions, the High Court judge concluded that the lower courts indeed overlooked the requirement to pay dower upon the husband's second marriage without permission. The court partially accepted the petition, setting aside the judgments and decrees of the lower courts concerning the dower amount and remanded the case to the trial court for reconsideration on this specific issue within two months. The judgments of the lower courts on other matters were upheld.",

Despite various notices and publications, Muhammad Fazal Rasool, the petitioner, did not participate in the proceedings. As a result, he was proceeded against ex parte, and the court issued judgments and decrees in favor of the respondents. The petitioner later filed an application to set aside these judgments and decrees, which was ultimately dismissed.The petitioner argued that the suit and judgments against him were obtained through improper means and that he was not properly served with notices. He also claimed that he was divorced from respondent No. 3 before the suit was filed. However, the court found that the petitioner's address was correctly mentioned in various documents, including the Nikahnama and the application he filed himself. The court also concluded that the petitioner had opportunities to defend himself but deliberately chose not to participate in the proceedings.Ultimately, the court dismissed the petition and ordered that an amount deposited by the petitioner be released to respondent No. 3 for the maintenance of the minors. The court noted that the petitioner had not paid any maintenance despite the previous judgments and decrees in favor of respondent No. 3.",

Court constituted with two membersand a President, whereas the reference to words 'President of Majlis-e-Shoora' was limitedonly to President of Majlis-e-Shoora---Provincial Government while defining

The principle that the Court should lean infavour of adjudication of causes on merits, appears to be available for invocation only whenthe person relying on it himself comes to the Court with clean hands and equitableconsiderations also lie in his favour. High Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction is bound toproceed on maxim \"he who seeks equity must do equity\". Constitutional jurisdiction is anequitable jurisdiction. Whoever comes to High Court to seek relief has to satisfy theconscience of the Court that he has clean hands. Writ jurisdiction cannot be exercised in aid of injustice. The High Court will not grant relief under Article 199 when the petitioner doesnot come to the Court with clean hands. He may claim relief only when he himself is notviolating provisions of law, especially of the law under which he is claiming entitlement whois guilty of bad faith and unconscionable conduct. The right is in the nature of ex debitojustitiae, but will only be granted if the petitioner can show that his conduct has not beensuch to disentitle him of such a relief. This jurisdiction of the High Court should not beexercised if it leads ultimately to a patent injustice.Manzoor Hussain v. Zulfiqar Ali 1983 SCMR 137; Abdul Wahid Khan v.

In such case, immediate report shall be made to the District and Sessions Judgeconcerned and also to the Chief Justice of the High Court. But the burden would be on thepolice to establish necessity for effecting physical arrest and handcuffing the judicial officer.If it was established that the physical arrest and handcuffing of the judicial officer wasunjustified, the police officers causing or responsible for such arrest and handcuffing wouldbe guilty of misconduct and would also be personally liable for compensation and/ordamages as may be summarily determined by the High Court.Delhi Judicial Service Association v.

Hamad Hassan, and Respondent No. 1, Mst. Isma Bukhari, who had filed a suit for the recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, and dowry articles, among other claims, following her marriage to the petitioner in 2014.The trial court decreed the suit in favor of Respondent No. 1, granting her various rights and benefits, such as dower, property shares, maintenance, and medical expenses. The petitioner challenged this decision in the district court, which upheld the judgment. Subsequently, the petitioner filed a writ petition before the High Court, alleging factual errors in the lower courts' decisions.The Supreme Court's judgment emphasized the limited scope of the High Court's constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, especially in cases involving appellate decisions. The court clarified that the High Court's constitutional jurisdiction was intended to rectify wrongful or excessive exercise of jurisdiction by lower courts and address procedural irregularities. It should not be used to re-examine or reconsider the facts of a case already decided by lower courts.The judgment also cited relevant case law to establish the legal position that the High Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the appellate court, except in cases of jurisdictional errors, misreading or non-reading of evidence, arbitrary exercise of powers, or violations of the law.In this specific case, the High Court had wrongly adjudicated on the facts, essentially acting as an appellate court, despite being tasked with constitutional oversight. The Supreme Court pointed out that allowing such re-argument amounted to entertaining a second appeal, which was not the intent of the legislature, particularly in family cases where expedient dispute resolution is paramount.Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed the petition and declined to grant leave for further appeal, stressing the importance of finality in appellate court decisions and the need to prevent unnecessary litigation. This judgment highlighted the need for legal proceedings to provide definitive resolutions and uphold the legislative intent for efficient legal dispute resolution.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The practice of Swara/Vani and similar customs to be un-Islamic, unconstitutional, and illegal --- the Federal Shariat Court dealt with a legal challenge regarding the practice of Swara/Vani in Kurram Agency, Pakistan. The petitioners sought to declare the custom of Swara/Vani as null and void, alleging that it was un-Islamic, unconstitutional, and repugnant to the principles of natural justice.The case revolved around the following key points:Mst. Sakeena Bibi, an adult Muslim girl, had contracted a Nikah with Syed Mushahid Hussain with her consent. Her family had initially refused the marriage proposal from the groom's side, but Mst. Sakeena proceeded with the Nikah independently.After the Nikah, Mst. Sakeena's family members, along with others, took her away with a promise to resolve the matter within a month. Various local jirgas were convened, but their decisions were not accepted by the parties.Eventually, a council of elders decided the matter in accordance with Rewaj-e-Kurram, a local custom. This decision was also endorsed by the Additional District Magistrate.The petitioners challenged the practice of Swara/Vani and the decision of the Additional District Magistrate in the Federal Shariat Court, claiming that they were against the principles of Islam, the Constitution, and natural justice.The Court noted several significant developments that affected the legal landscape of the case:The 25th Constitutional Amendment merged the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, resulting in the abrogation of the Frontier Crime Regulations (FCR) and the extension of national and provincial laws to the merged areas.The Court cited a 2019 Supreme Court judgment, declaring that no individual or group could assume the jurisdiction of a civil or criminal court without lawful authority.The Court highlighted the introduction of Section 310-A of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribed penalties for giving a female in marriage or otherwise as part of practices like Swara/Vani. This section aimed to eradicate such practices.Ultimately, the Court found the practice of Swara/Vani and similar customs to be un-Islamic, unconstitutional, and illegal, aligning with the principles of the Quran and Sunnah. Given the changes in legal status due to the constitutional amendment, the Court disposed of the petition.",

Here's a summary:The text begins by emphasizing that the Act is aimed at protecting women from domestic violence, and the focus is on the \"aggrieved person\" being a female, while the \"defendant\" could be male or female.It addresses various provisions of the Act, including protection orders, the use of GPS trackers, and the overall legal framework. The court concludes that these measures do not violate the teachings of Islam, as they are designed to protect the lives and dignity of women.The text also mentions the importance of reconciling disputes and amicably settling family issues, as encouraged by the Holy Quran and Sunnah. The Act includes provisions for mediation and reconciliation, which are in line with Islamic principles.Furthermore, the Act contains checks and balances to prevent its misuse, including penalties for filing false complaints and provisions for summary trials and appeals.The use of GPS trackers is discussed, and it is emphasized that such measures are taken in exceptional situations where a woman's life is at risk, and they are considered acceptable to protect life and dignity, which are primary goals in Islamic teachings.The text includes statistics on cases handled under the Act, showing a high percentage of successful resolutions, which underscores the Act's effectiveness.The text highlights that the Punjab Protection of Women against Violence Act aims to protect women from domestic violence while remaining in line with Islamic principles and values.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Judgement on Khulla --- The central issue revolved around the legality of Khula (dissolution of marriage initiated by the wife) and whether the Family Court's judgment was in accordance with Islamic law. The petitioner argued that the Family Court's decision was influenced by a provision, Section 10(5) of the Family Courts (Amendment) Act, 2015, which had been declared null and void by the Federal Shariat Court in a previous judgment.The court clarified several key points related to Khula in Islamic law:Khula is an absolute right granted to women by Islamic law, allowing them to seek the dissolution of their marriage through a court.A wife can claim Khula without the necessity of proving mistreatment or ill-treatment. She only needs to state her inability to continue living with her husband within the limits set by Allah.The amount of compensation (Badl-e-Khula) to be paid by the wife to her husband should not exceed the total amount of Mahar (dower) received at the time of marriage. However, this amount can be reduced depending on the circumstances of the case.The court can grant Khula even if the husband does not agree to it, provided that the wife meets the necessary conditions.The court emphasized that Khula is a fundamental right for women and cannot be denied. Once a judgment attains finality, it becomes binding on high courts and all subordinate courts.Ultimately, the Shariat Petition was dismissed because it was not maintainable. The court's decision was based on the principles of Islamic law and the assertion that the right of Khula for women is absolute and protected by the Quran and Sunnah. The court provided a detailed analysis of Khula and its legal implications within the framework of Islamic jurisprudence.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The Supreme Court of Pakistan established a JIT to investigate allegations related to the acquisition of Avenfield Apartments by the Sharif family and their ownership of offshore companies.The JIT's task was to examine how the Gulf Steel Mills came into existence, what led to its sale, what happened to its liabilities, and the details of its sale proceeds.The JIT also looked into the ownership of flats in London by the Sharif family, the sources of funds for companies like Flagship Investment Ltd, and significant financial transactions between family members.The JIT's work was to be completed within 60 days.JIT's Activities:The JIT initiated investigations, collected evidence, and conducted interviews with relevant parties.They obtained information from various institutions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), banks, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and National Accountability Bureau (NAB).The JIT also sought Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAs) from foreign jurisdictions and recorded witness statements, including those of the accused family members.Key Evidence and Documents:The JIT analyzed various documents, including affidavits provided by individuals like Mr. Tariq Shafi and letters from foreign parties.They reviewed share sale contracts, partnership agreements, and bank documents related to Gulf Steel Mills and its sale.The JIT investigated the alleged transfer of bearer shares of offshore companies to the Sharif family in 2006.Legal Analysis:Bearing of the JIT on Legal Proceedings: The JIT's formation and investigation were based on an order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, emphasizing the importance of a legal framework in conducting investigations involving high-profile individuals. The JIT's authority and scope of its work were clearly defined by the court.Burden of Proof and Accused's Right to Defend: The JIT's findings shifted the burden of proof onto the accused. The accused were provided with notices and opportunities to defend themselves, present evidence, and produce supporting documents. Failure to do so can be seen as detrimental to their legal position.Ownership of Offshore Companies: A critical issue in the case was the ownership of offshore companies and the Avenfield Apartments. The prosecution argued that the accused failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of legitimate ownership.Hearsay and Documentary Evidence: The JIT examined various documents, including affidavits and letters, some of which were found to be based on hearsay. This highlights the legal importance of verifying the authenticity and credibility of evidence in a case.Concurrent Sentences: The accused were convicted of various offenses, and their sentences were ordered to run concurrently, reflecting the legal principle that multiple convictions should not result in cumulative sentences.Proclaimed Offenders: The two accused individuals who remained absconding were declared as proclaimed offenders, and non-bailable warrants for their arrest were issued.Disqualification from Public Office: The accused were also disqualified from contesting elections or holding public office for a specified period following their convictions. This serves as a legal consequence of criminal convictions for public officials.In summary, this case involves a complex legal investigation conducted by the JIT under the orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. It underscores the importance of legal procedures, burden of proof, and the need for accused individuals to provide compelling evidence to defend themselves in high-stakes cases.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The judge in his 131-page judgment in Al-Azizia corruption reference concluded that the prosecution (NAB) successfully established all the ingredients of the offence of corruption and corrupt practices against Nawaz Sharif as defined under section 9 (a) (v) of the NAO 1999 read with section 14 (c).\u00ecThereof as per the charge framed for holding and being true and real beneficial owner of the assets, the Al Azizia Steel Company Limited (ASCL), the Hill Metal Establishment (HME) and related remittances, beyond his known sources of income as he failed to establish contrary thereto.\u00eeThe court said it is satisfied and conclude that Sharif as a stratagem avoided appearing before the investigation officer so as to avoid to respond to questions with regard to the issues which are now the subject matter of this reference and avoid being confronted with the glaring absence of money trail documentary evidence and material divergence, gaps and inconsistencies in the version of Nawaz Sharif.The court noted that Sharif elected not to produce a single witness in the defence.The order said Nawaz Sharif and his sons \u00f1 Hussain and Hassan \u00f1 are very closely related and members of a tightly knit, monolithic, patriarchal family with close association and jointly held financial business interests. There is nothing on record to suggest that there is any hostility between the three.It also held that claim of Sharif that he has no beneficial interest or share in ASCL is unsubstantiated, false and fabricated and his son Hussain Nawaz was never the exclusive nor real and beneficial owner.The latter essentially being a mere benamidar of his father who was holding his father\u00eds share in ASCL but in reality for the benefit of his father who was true and real beneficial owner,\u00ee said the judgment.The court is not satisfied that pattern and manner in which remittances were made between 2010 and May 2017 cannot reasonably be characterised as genuine and bonafide gifts from a son to his father.The remittances are made at regular intervals at times almost on monthly basis suggesting these are not a regular source of income from an owned business without which Sharif could not be able to maintain himself.It said Sharif ostensibly received these gifts to free him from any financial constraints given his full time involvement in politics but in actual fact admits to having utilised about 70 percent thereof as owned disbursement to his daughter, Maryam.\u00ecThe record suggests that money was circulated through HME and Hussain Nawaz to the accounts of Nawaz Sharif under the garb of gifts and factually it was a device for equitable shares in the assets and money of accused (Nawaz) being father to his children,\u00ee said the order.The court said evidences shows that Nawaz over a sustained period received the lion\u00eds share (in excess of 88 per cent) of the stated net profit of the HME and this fact establishes that Nawaz is a beneficiary of major portion the fruits (net profit) of HME.\u00ecThe true and real beneficial owner of ASCL was and HME is the accused No1 (Nawaz Sharif) his elder son and absconding co-accused was merely an ostensible owner holding the said assets for the benefit and enjoyment of his father,\u00ee said the orderThe court said it is established from the record that an aggregate amount of Rs272.54 million and $52,460 dollar have also been remitted by the HME to the account of its employee Muhammad Hanif Khan during the period 2010 to 2015 and an amount of Rs173.455 million was remitted by HME to one Anjum Iqbal Ahmed Akhtar during 2013 to 2017.\u00ecAn amount of Rs36.715 million has been sent by HME into account of Abdur Razzaq from November 2016, Rs11.991 million remitted by HME to Muhammad Anees and $52,460 remitted by the HME to Khawaja Haroon Pasha.\u00eeThe order said throughout the trial proceedings Sharif raised legal objections regarding the banks documents but he neither during cross examination nor his statement under section 342 CrP C he has questioned the correctness of the figured amounts having been remitted from HME or Hussain Nawaz in his accounts being maintained in different banks.Remittances of dirham 12,67,856 and $1,02,19,155 were received by Sharif from his elder son Hussain Nawaz and from the HME during the period from January 2010 to June 2017 and these foreign currency receipts were converted and credited to his rupee accounts which translates to Rs1.187 billion.\u00ee",

The court emphasized that such obligations and defenses are factual matters requiring proper legal proceedings. It stressed the importance of a fair trial and due process, asserting that evidence for claims of maintenance against the grandfather should be presented in a suit, not in execution proceedings. The court rejected the notion that a maintenance decree against the father could be directly executed against the grandfather.Consequently, the court declared the orders attaching the petitioner's property as illegal, emphasizing that the petitioner, not being a party to the original suit, could not be subjected to the decree. The court allowed the petitioner's application for the release of his property from attachment, emphasizing the need for lawful authority in court decisions. However, it clarified that if the child decided to pursue maintenance against the grandfather, a suit could be filed in accordance with the law, and the Family Court might order interim maintenance if the conditions for the grandfather's liability are met.",

Compensatory costs imposed on failure to pay it ----- The petitioner argued that since the marriage was still ongoing, the mehr was not payable. However, the court, led by Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, rejected this argument, citing Islamic principles and relevant legal provisions.The court highlighted the significance of mehr as an Islamic concept and pointed to Section 10 of The Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which stipulates that the entire amount of the dower shall be payable on demand if no details are specified in the nikahnama. The judgment emphasized that mehr can be demanded during the marriage, and the husband is obligated to pay it.The court found that the impugned judgment aligns with the law, and the petitioner's defense was untenable. It criticized the petitioner for involving the respondent in litigation and causing unnecessary delays in reaching the Supreme Court. The court expressed concern about frivolous litigation hindering the judicial system.Leave to appeal was declined, and the petition was dismissed. The court imposed costs on the petitioner, including compensatory costs of one hundred thousand rupees, emphasizing the importance of making the petitioner act reasonably.

The petition addressed his alleged forced exile, restrictions on his return to Pakistan, and legal issues related to a criminal case against him.According to the petitioner, he faced detention after the 1999 military takeover, was acquitted in an airplane hijacking case, and was subsequently deported to Saudi Arabia in 2000. The government contended that there was an agreement for the Sharif family to live in exile, but the petitioner denied such a deal. Shahbaz Sharif asserted his constitutional right to participate in politics and claimed that laws were amended to bar him from contesting elections.The petitioner argued that the government, through statements by officials like Faisal Saleh Hayat and General Pervez Musharraf, indicated that he would not be allowed to return. He expressed apprehensions about boarding a plane to Pakistan and alleged instructions to prevent any Sharif family member from landing in Pakistan. The petition also referenced a criminal case against Shahbaz Sharif and his efforts to address the charges.The Supreme Court dismissed the petitions on April 7, 2004, stating that Shahbaz Sharif could return from abroad, subject to the country's laws. The judgment discussed the jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, emphasizing the need for a public importance element in cases involving fundamental rights. The court found that the petitioner failed to raise questions of public importance and that his apprehensions were insufficient grounds for the court's intervention.The judgment highlighted the petitioner's constitutional right to enter and remain in Pakistan but noted that he had not taken concrete steps earlier to return. The court deemed the petitions not maintainable, emphasizing that Shahbaz Sharif could return, subject to the law of the country.",

Section 147 of the Act ibid provides a mechanism for affirmation of partitions privately effected.

In other words in absence of any order of affirmation in terms of Section 147 of the \"Act, 1967\" party relying upon private partition would be precluded to claim any right thereunder. It would not be out of context to mention here that Chapter 18 of the Land Record Manual provides a procedure in partition cases and clause 18.1 especially deals with private partitions.

Section 7 of the \"Act, 1964\" prescribes the manner of institution of suits before the Family Court whereas section 8 deals with the procedure of intimation to defendant on presentation of plaint before the Family Court. Section 9 deals with the written statement and sub-section 5 of section 9 postulates that if the defendant fails to appear on the date fixed by the Family Court for his appearance, and it is proved that summons or notice was duly served on the defendant, the Family Court may proceed ex-parte. Since the suit was decreed ex-parte, so sub-sections 6 and 7 of section 9 of the \"Act, 1964\" would be quite relevant for the resolution of matter in issue. It is an oft repeated principle that when law provides a specific manner for performing an act, then it should be performed in such manner but in no other way. Needless to mention that limitation of 30 days for filing an application for setting aside ex-parte decree would start from the service of notice under sub-section 7 as added by the Ordinance LV of 2002. Though Rule 13 of the Family Court Rules, 1965 postulates that an ex-parte decree or proceeding may for sufficient cause shown be set aside by the Court on application made to it within 30 days of the passing of the decree or decision but this rule is apparently showing scorn and derogative of the basic provision of \"Act ,1964\". It is trite law that whenever there is an inconsistency between the rule and the basic provision of statute, the latter will prevail.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Defamation & perjury route differently for trial; concept of judicial proceeding during investigation --- The case involves Sumera Rasheed, the petitioner, seeking special leave to appeal against the acquittal of Abida Shahid and Muhammad Sajjad (respondents No.2 & 3) in a private complaint under sections 500, 193, 195, 196, 211, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The petitioner alleges defamation and malicious prosecution due to false accusations made in an FIR related to a property dispute.Abdul Razaq, Sumera Rasheed's husband, had purchased two plots in Evergreen Housing Colony, Haroon Abad. The dispute arose when suspicions arose that the plot was sold to multiple individuals by Shahid Iqbal, the owner of the colony. Legal actions were taken, including securing status quo through a civil court and a subsequent FIR against the petitioner's family.The petitioner contends that the lower court's order, dated 15.12.2022, under section 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which led to the acquittal of the respondents, was not correctly interpreted. The petitioner's counsel argues that the lower court failed to appreciate the law, emphasizing that statements made during investigation also constitute giving or fabricating false evidence.The prosecutor counters, citing section 502-A of the PPC, which grants the Court of Session the authority to entertain complaints directly, and that other offenses can be tried along with the offense under section 500 PPC.The judge, after reviewing the legal arguments, discusses the nature of perjury and the distinctions between lying and perjury. The judge emphasizes that the mode of trial is a crucial aspect, questioning whether offenses under sections 193/195/196/211 PPC can be tried along with section 500 PPC.The judge concludes that the lower court's order was justified, dismissing the special leave to appeal and declining leave to appeal. The decision is based on the understanding that statements made during the investigation, at this premature stage, cannot be the basis for defamation, and the lower court correctly applied the law.The detailed order delves into legal interpretations, emphasizing the importance of eradicating perjury and ensuring justice. The judge expresses concern about the manipulation of cases by powerful elites and the need for a study to understand how cases are structured with the help of police.",

The Family Court consolidated the suits and framed several issues to be addressed.After evaluating evidence from both parties, the Family Court dismissed the Petitioner's suit and decreed the Respondent's suit, granting her 120 Tolas silver ornaments, Rs. 1,500,000/- as dower, Rs. 10,000/- per month as pocket money, Rs. 10,000/- per month as maintenance allowance, and dowry articles.The Petitioner challenged the judgment, arguing that the maintenance allowance and pocket money were excessive, the dower had been paid through a cheque, and the value of dowry articles was wrongly determined.The judgment provides a detailed analysis of the evidence, concluding that the Petitioner failed to prove the payment of dower through a cheque and that the Respondent was entitled to the decreed amounts.

Similarly, writ petition against order of acquittal is also not competent in the light of section 417(2), Cr.P.C. --- The petitioner, Hajra Javaid Makhdoom, initiated the petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, seeking redress, specifically requesting a retrial and criminal revision in a case involving the respondent, Muhammad Tehmas Nasir.The petitioner's grievance revolved around a private complaint filed under section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, alleging that the respondent had contracted a second marriage without her consent. Subsequently, the Judicial Magistrate in Sargodha summoned the respondent to face trial under section 6(5) of the Ordinance. However, during the proceedings, the respondent submitted an application under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., contending that the petitioner's complaint was baseless and driven by ulterior motives.The magistrate accepted the respondent's application, leading the petitioner to file a criminal revision. This revision was later dismissed by the Additional Sessions Judge. The petitioner, dissatisfied with both decisions, filed the present writ petition, urging the Lahore High Court to refer the case back to the Judicial Magistrate for retrial and the criminal revision back to the Additional Sessions Judge.In the judgment dated December 19, 2023, Judge Muhammad Tariq Nadeem meticulously examined the legal aspects raised in the petition. The judge acknowledged the petitioner's contention that against an order of acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., a criminal revision was competent, citing \"The State through Advocate-General, Sindh High Court of Karachi v. Raja Abdul Rehman\" (2005 SCMR 1544) as a precedent.However, Judge Nadeem went on to analyze the relevant legal provisions, emphasizing section 417(2), Cr.P.C., which stipulates that an appeal lies against an order of acquittal. The judge observed that the petitioner had not satisfactorily addressed whether the order of acquittal under section 249-A, Cr.P.C., was amenable to criminal revision or could be challenged through a petition for special leave to appeal under section 417(2), Cr.P.C.The judgment delved into the interplay between sections 439, 439-A, and 417(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, clarifying that while an appeal could be filed against an order of acquittal, no proceedings by way of revision could be entertained if an appeal was available. Additionally, the judgment underscored the distinction between criminal appeals and revisions, highlighting that a revision against an order of acquittal was not competent under section 439(4)(a), Cr.P.C.Judge Nadeem concluded that the criminal revision before the court of the Additional Sessions Judge was not competent, as the order of acquittal could only be challenged through the remedy provided in section 417(2), Cr.P.C. The judge dismissed the writ petition, asserting that a constitutional petition was not maintainable when a specific alternate remedy of appeal against acquittal existed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, invoked the constitutional jurisdiction of the Lahore High Court to challenge the orders dated 03.06.2022 and 31.10.2023 passed by the Judge Family Court, Lahore, and the Additional Sessions Judge, Lahore, respectively. The petitioner filed a complaint under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, accusing respondent Feroz Usmani of contracting a second marriage without permission while still married to her. Other respondents were accused of facilitating the marriage. ----Issues: 1- Whether the complaint against the remaining respondents, aside from Feroz Usmani, disclosed any offense under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. 2- Whether the trial court and the additional sessions court erred in dismissing the complaint against the other respondents. 3- Whether the orders passed by the courts below are in accordance with the law and facts of the case. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: ---Application of Mind by the Magistrate: The Additional Sessions Judge emphasized that the magistrate must be satisfied that a trial is necessary based on the available record before issuing a process to summon the respondents. The court found that no incriminating material was available on record against the respondents, except for Feroz Usmani. ---Strict Interpretation of Criminal Statutes: The court noted that the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, specifically Section 6(5), does not prescribe any offense or penalty against anyone other than the husband who contracts another marriage without permission from the Arbitration Council. The ordinance does not provide for any inchoate offenses such as attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy in relation to polygamy. ---Evidence and Cursory Statements: The complaint and cursory statements did not provide sufficient material to justify summoning the other respondents. The evidence provided by the petitioner was deemed insufficient to establish a prima facie case against them. ---Non-Applicability of Pakistan Penal Code: The court held that, being a special statute, the provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, such as Section 109 for abetment, cannot be read into the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance to broaden the scope of the offense prescribed under Section 6(5). The Lahore High Court dismissed the writ petition, finding no illegality or jurisdictional error in the orders passed by the Family Court and the Additional Sessions Judge. The complaint against respondents other than Feroz Usmani did not disclose any offense under Section 6(5) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. The petition was dismissed in limine for being devoid of merit. -----Citations/Precedents: Mirza Shaukat Baig and others vs. Shahid Jamil and others (PLD 2005 Supreme Court 530) Ex-Lance Naik Mukarram Hussain and others v.

Journalists are criticized for not conducting due diligence before reporting news of significant importance, leading to the spread of rumors and insinuations. Statements from media persons, including Mir Ibrahim Rehman, Chief Executive of Geo Network, and Kamran Khan, are scrutinized for lacking thorough checks and contributing to a damaging media onslaught on the judiciary.The document points out the absence of professional thoroughness and due diligence in media reporting, citing examples of incomplete evidence and lack of verification in the alleged bribery case involving Malik Riaz.--- The Suo Moto case initiated on June 6, 2012, in response to talk shows implicating individuals in illegal acts, casting doubt on the judiciary's independence. Media personalities like Kamran Khan and Hamid Mir reported on alleged misconduct by Dr. Arsalan Iftikhar, son of the Chief Justice, involving blackmail and financial improprieties. --- Concerns are raised about media ethics and responsibility. Media coverage, driven by baseless allegations, led to public apprehension about the judiciary's integrity. The Court critiques journalists for lack of due diligence, emphasizing the need for fairness and objectivity in reporting. --- The Court, while not making a final judgment on guilt, concludes that the judiciary's integrity remains intact. Malik Riaz's admission that no favors were granted dispels doubts cast on the Court. The case highlights the importance of due diligence in media reporting and the need for discretion in private and public dealings, especially for family members of public functionaries. the Court urged the Attorney General to pursue legal action against individuals involved in any illegal acts, emphasizing the rule of law. The judgment concludes with hope for a brighter future and quotes from the poet Hafez, underlining the significance of justice and equality before the law.",

(2) A mere denial by the executant of a registered sale deed is insufficient to shift the burden onto the beneficiary to prove the valid execution of the registered document.'' ---- The appellants claimed ownership of a piece of land, alleging that the respondents obtained it fraudulently from their minor family members.The respondents, in response, contended that the property was legally transferred to them, and they denied any fraudulent activity. The dispute was initially heard by a trial court, which conducted a visual comparison of signatures on the relevant documents.In the trial court's judgment, it was found that the appellants failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove their claim of fraud. The trial court relied on the principles of Muhammadan Law by Mulla and various articles of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (Q.S.O.) to establish the burden of proof and evidentiary requirements. The court cited precedents such as Ghulam Ghous v. Muhammad Yasin (2009 SCMR 70) to emphasize that fraud allegations needed to be proven and that a simple denial was not sufficient.The trial court also referred to the case of Zar Wali Shah v. Yousaf Ali Shah (1992 SCMR 1778), which supported the practice of visual comparison of signatures. This comparison did not favor the appellants' case.As a result, the trial court ruled in favor of the respondents, emphasizing that the appellants failed to discharge the burden of proof. The appellants appealed to the High Court, which allowed the respondents' civil revision under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (C.P.C.).The appellants then brought this appeal before the Supreme Court of Pakistan under Article 185(2)(d) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. The Supreme Court considered various precedents, including Ahmed Hassan Khan v. Naveed Abbas (1998 SCMR 346), Mehr Manzoor Hussain v. Muhammad Nawaz (2010 SCMR 1042), Abdul Ghani v. Mst. Yasmeen Khan (2011 SCMR 837), and Yar Muhammad Khan v. Sajjad Abbas (2021 SCMR 1401) to examine the burden of proof, the shifting of that burden, and evidentiary requirements in property disputes.In the final judgment, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the lower courts, emphasizing that the appellants failed to meet the requisite burden of proof. The material official witness, Muhammad Aslam, the Sub-Registrar, did not support the appellants' version, further weakening their case. The Court concluded that the respondents had established their legal ownership of the property in question.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The crux of the matter involved a dispute over the determination of dower, specifically pertaining to five tolas of gold ornaments or their price equivalent to Rs. 2,25,000/-. The appellant had initially filed a suit seeking the recovery of this dower, as well as maintenance for herself and a minor child, and both the Family Court and the District Judge had ruled in her favor.However, the Peshawar High Court, in the writ petition filed by the respondent, set aside the judgments and decrees of the lower courts, except for the maintenance allowance. The High Court accepted the respondent's claim for the recovery of five tolas of gold ornaments or Rs. 2,25,000/- as the price thereof.The appellant argued that an Iqrarnama (agreement) dated 21st November 2012, which stipulated the dower as five tolas of gold ornaments, was still valid and had not been canceled by a subsequent Iqrarnama dated 9th April 2013. The respondent contended that the later Iqrarnama had an overriding effect and canceled the earlier agreement.The Supreme Court examined the legality of these agreements in light of Islamic law and statutory provisions. It emphasized that dower is a fundamental right granted to wives under Islamic law and cannot be waived through agreements. Additionally, agreements related to the custody of minor children, like the one in question, were found to be violative of the law and public policy.The Court cited precedents, such as the case of Bahadur Khan and others v. Federation of Pakistan [2017 SCMR 2066] and Zulfiqar Ali v. Musarrat Bibi and others [2006 SCMR 1136], which upheld the rights of wives regarding dower and agreements affecting those rights.Ultimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the High Court had not correctly assessed the evidence on record and set aside the judgments of the lower courts with respect to the recovery of dower (five tolas of gold ornaments or their price). However, it upheld the judgment regarding maintenance allowance for Mst. Haseena Bibi and the minor child.",

It involved the detention and alleged mistreatment of certain individuals by Pakistani security forces. The petitioners, Mst. Rohaifa (deceased) and her sons, alleged that their family members were unlawfully detained and subjected to torture, leading to the deaths of some detainees.Judicial Analysis and Key Issues:Jurisdiction of Supreme Court Over Tribal Areas:The Court examined its jurisdiction in relation to tribal areas under Article 247(7) of the Constitution. The Court?s jurisdiction was found to be limited, particularly in cases where the cause of action and the subject matter of the dispute originated in tribal areas.Allegations of Illegal Detention and Torture:The petitioners alleged that their relatives were unlawfully detained by Pakistani security forces and subjected to torture, resulting in the deaths of some detainees. The respondents, including the Ministry of Defence, denied these allegations, attributing the deaths to medical conditions and not to torture or maltreatment.Legal Status of Detainees:The detainees were initially acquitted by the Anti-Terrorism Court but were later arrested in the tribal areas and tried under the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR). This shift in legal proceedings highlighted the complexity of jurisdictional issues in Pakistan, especially concerning tribal areas.Constitutional Rights and Detention under FCR:The Court deliberated on the detainees' constitutional rights in the context of their detention and trial under the FCR. It recognized the right to life and liberty but also acknowledged the constraints imposed by the tribal justice system and the FCR.Treatment of Detainees in Custody:The Court issued directives to ensure the detainees' welfare in custody, including proper medical treatment, and allowed regular family visits, emphasizing the detainees' rights to health and humane treatment.Conclusion and Orders:The Supreme Court disposed of the petition, noting that the detainees were no longer under illegal detention as they were being tried under the FCR in the tribal area. The Court directed the prison authorities to provide proper care and treatment to the detainees and allowed regular family visits. The Court also dismissed related criminal petitions, finding no substantial evidence of contempt of court by the respondents. The case underscored the challenges of balancing constitutional rights with the realities of law enforcement and security operations in tribal areas.",

The provincial government had also sent a reference to the federal government to reconstitute the Board of Trustees of the Shaikh Zayad Bin Sultan An-Nahyan Trust. The Secretary of Health dismissed the concerns of the hospital's faculty members about potential adverse effects on the salary structure. He mentioned the formation of a Managing Committee, chaired by Mr. Ishaq Dar, Federal Minister for Finance, as an interim arrangement to oversee the hospital's operations.The court expressed concern about the long period without a meeting of the Managing Committee, suggesting potential issues with the hospital's functioning. However, the court decided not to constitute a committee or commission at that time, relying on the assurance of the Secretary of Health that the matter would be resolved, and the reference sent to the federal government would lead to a more permanent arrangement. The case was adjourned to a date to be determined in the second week of January 2014.Regarding Efroz Chemicals, their counsel stated that they were willing to pay compensation to each bereaved family in line with C.M.A. No. 1624-L/2013. They also expressed a willingness to increase the compensation to Rs. 400,000 per bereaved family if the state dropped the prosecution of criminal cases related to the incident. The court issued notices to the Prosecutor General of Punjab and the Advocate General of Punjab, instructing them to examine the matter and seek instructions from the competent authority.

All the provisions of the Ordinance, therefore, should beread and interpreted in the light of this title and preamble and terms not defined in theOrdinance itself, must be construed and interpreted in accordance with the `Injunctionsof Islam as set out in the Holy Qura'n and Sunnah'. The words `validly married'occurring in the definition of `Zina' in section 4 of the Ordinance have not been definedin the Ordinance. The definition, therefore, will be sought from the Injunctions ofIslam because the Ordinance intends to bring the existing law relating to Zina inconformity with them.Moreover, section 3 of the Ordinance has given the provisions of the Ordinance anoverriding effect on `any other law for the time being in force'.The logical result of this scheme of the provisions of the Ordinance is that if there is aclash between an existing law and the Injunctions of Islam with regard to the validityof a marriage, the Injunctions of Islam shall prevail for the purpose of this Ordinance.Thus, if a marriage is valid in Shariah, it shall be held valid for the purpose of thisOrdinance, even though it is not recognised as valid in any other law for the time beingin force.(d) Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance (VII of 1979)???????Preamble???All the provisions of the Ordinance have to be read and interpreted inthe light of the title and preamble which are not defined in the' Ordinanceitself???Ordinance must be construed and interpreted in accordance with the Injunctionsof Islam as set out in the Holy Qura'n and Sunnah.(e) Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance (VII of 1979)???????S. 4???`Zina'???Definition???Word `Zinc' having not been defined in the Ordinancethe definition of the word was to be sought from the Injunctions of Islam.(f) Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance (VII of 1979)???????S. 4???Validity of marriage???Where there is clash between an existing law and theInjunctions of Islam with regard to the validity of marriage, the Injunctions of theIslam shall prevail for the purpose of the Ordinance.(g) Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance (VII of 1979)?????S. 4???Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (VIII of 1961), S.7???Allegation ofZina???Plea of valid marriage by accused???Provision of S.7, Muslim Family LawsOrdinance, cannot affect the validity of a marriage contracted according to Shariah atleast to the extent of the criminal liability envisaged in the Ordinance.Mirza Qamar Raja v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case involves an inheritance dispute over the legacy of Qaim Khan, with the claimants being the great-grandchildren of Qaim Khan through his daughter Mst. Khanzadi, who passed away about 30 years ago. The legal heirs of Qaim Khan include the respondents, who are descendants of his son Hafeezullah.The appellants argued that the right of inheritance is not bound by any law of limitation under Islamic law. They claimed that fraud was committed to exclude Mst. Khanzadi from the family pedigree, resulting in the transfer of the disputed property to the respondents. They cited several precedents in support of their contentions.The respondents argued that the appellants' claim is time-barred, given the long period that has passed since the death of Qaim Khan and the sale of property to third parties. They also referred to legal precedents to support their position.The Supreme Court reviewed the cited judgments and highlighted the distinction between cases where an heir is deprived of their share before third-party interests are created and cases where third-party interests are already established. In cases with third-party interests, the burden of proof rests on the claimant heir to demonstrate their lack of awareness of the fraud and their rights. The Court noted that the appellants' claim is time-barred, as the third-party transactions occurred several decades ago.The Court concluded that the appellants' appeal lacks exceptional circumstances warranting interference with the lower courts' decisions. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Law related to paternity claims '' challenges to paternity could not be brought by third parties'' --- The court discouraged the use of criminal law in family matters by not only quashing the criminal case, but also directing the IGP Islamabad for holding police officers accountable for the malpractice. ----- The FIR alleged that Shafqat Hussain had facilitated the falsification of NADRA records to show his son, Mohsin Shafqat, as his own child. Shafqat Hussain's counsel argued that the charges were baseless, motivated by malice, and initiated by a retired police officer who was trying to benefit from the distribution of property left by Shafqat Hussain's former wife, who had subsequently married the complainant. They also mentioned that the deceased wife of the complainant had claimed to be the mother of Shafqat Hussain's son in a guardian petition.The judgment, delivered by Babar Sattar, J., emphasized the legal precedents established in previous cases, particularly highlighting Article 128 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 (\"1984 Order\"), which stated that challenges to paternity could not be brought by third parties. The court cited cases like Mst. Laila Qayyum Vs. Fawad Qayum and others (PLD 2019 SC 449) to support this principle.Furthermore, the judgment noted that even the petitioner, Shafqat Hussain, could not challenge the paternity of his son, Mohsin Shafqat, due to the expiration of the prescribed period. The court cited various legal cases, such as Mohammad Nawaz Vs. Additional District and Sessions Judge (Civil Petition No.2414-L/2015), Urooj Tabani Vs. Federation of Pakistan, Suhail Abbasi Vs. Mst. Khushboo and others, and others to emphasize the legal protections in place for the legitimacy and paternity of a child.Given the legal precedents and the absence of any valid grounds for the charges in the FIR, the court allowed the petition, quashed the FIR, and invalidated any related proceedings. The court also ordered the complainant/respondent No.1 to pay costs of Rs. 100,000 to the petitioner within 30 days and directed the Inspector General of Police Islamabad to conduct an inquiry into potential abuse of authority by the police officer who registered the FIR. Disciplinary proceedings would be initiated if abuse of authority was confirmed.",

It referred to Article 128 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, which stipulates that a child born within a valid marriage is presumed legitimate, and the denial of paternity must be immediate post-birth to be considered under Islamic law. The Court also noted the lack of immediate denial of paternity by the respondent, rendering his subsequent claims invalid. The judgment underscored that legal and societal norms prioritize the protection of the family unit and the integrity of children born within a marriage.Key Citations and Precedents:Article 128 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order: Establishes the presumption of legitimacy for children born within a valid marriage.Section 2 of the West Pakistan Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962: Stipulates that Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) governs issues of legitimacy and bastardy among Muslims.References to Islamic jurisprudence, particularly the works of Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Muhammad, and Imam Yousaf, regarding the denial of paternity.The case of Muhammad Shahid Sahil Vs. The State (PLD 2010 FSC 215) was distinguished as it pertained to a criminal case involving rape, not applicable to the civil context of paternity within a marriage.Conclusion:The Supreme Court of Pakistan dismissed the respondent's suit and the request for a DNA test, emphasizing the legal and societal importance of protecting the legitimacy of children born within a marriage. The judgment reinforces the legal framework that prioritizes family integrity and the protection of children's rights in paternity disputes.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: In a case of first instance, an international custody order under the Hague Convention was enforced in Pakistan and the mother was ordered to return the child to US as that was in the child's best interest ---- Issues:1) Whether the wrongful retention of the child by Respondent No.1 justifies the enforcement of the US custody order under the Hague Convention in Pakistan. ---- 2)Whether the child's welfare is best served by being returned to the petitioner father, aligning with both international conventions and Pakistani family law. ---- Holding:The court directed the respondent mother to transfer custody of the minor to the petitioner father, facilitating the child's repatriation to the United States. This decision is in line with the Hague Convention and previous court orders, marking a landmark enforcement of an international family judgment in Pakistan.ReasoningThe court's deliberation focused on:The paramountcy of the child's welfare, in line with the UNCRC principles, which advocate for a nurturing upbringing.Evaluations by the Council for Children?s Rights and US court, which favored the petitioner's ability to provide a superior environment for the child.Legal obligations under the Hague Convention and Pakistani statutes, particularly the incorporation of the Hague Convention into the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, to address international child abduction.Precedents from Pakistani and international jurisdictions, advocating for the child's return to their habitual residence to resolve custody disputes, with this case setting a novel precedent in Pakistan for the enforcement of international family judgments.Citations and Precedents Relied UponHague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980UNCRC, 1989Key Pakistani and international cases, such as PLD 2007 Lahore 293 (Ms. LOUISE ANNE FAIRLEY v. SAJJAD AHMED RANA) and 2019 CLC 1311, which underscore the significance of the child's habitual residence and well-being in custody conflicts. --- The incorporation of the Hague Convention into the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, to address international child abduction is a significant legal development that bridges international law and Pakistani family law, particularly in the context of cross-border child custody disputes. This section will delve into the legal obligations under the Hague Convention, its integration into Pakistani law, and the implications of such incorporation.The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child AbductionThe Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, 1980, is an international treaty aimed at securing the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any contracting state. The Convention seeks to protect children from the harmful effects of abduction and retention across international boundaries by providing a procedure to bring about their prompt return.Key Provisions of the Hague Convention:Article 3: Defines the wrongful removal or retention of a child as a breach of custody rights under the law of the child's habitual residence.Article 12: Stipulates that a child should be promptly returned to their habitual residence unless a year has passed and the child has settled into their new environment.Article 13: Provides exceptions to the return, including if there is a grave risk that the return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm.Incorporation into Pakistani StatutesPakistan's accession to the Hague Convention and its subsequent incorporation into domestic law, specifically the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, represents a commitment to aligning with international legal standards regarding child abduction. This incorporation allows for the Hague Convention's provisions to be applied within Pakistani legal proceedings, enabling Pakistani courts to handle cases of international child abduction more effectively.Implications of Incorporation:Jurisdiction of Family Courts: By including the Hague Convention within the scope of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, Pakistan has granted its family courts the jurisdiction to hear cases related to international child abduction. This means that such matters can be adjudicated within the family court system, providing a clear legal pathway for the resolution of cross-border custody disputes.Enforcement of International Custody Orders: The incorporation enables Pakistani courts to recognize and enforce custody orders made by courts in other Hague Convention signatory countries, provided that such enforcement is in line with the Convention's principles and respects the child's welfare.Legal Recourse for Abducted Children: Parents or guardians seeking the return of a child abducted to Pakistan from another Hague Convention country now have a legal framework to pursue their case within the Pakistani legal system. This framework ensures that the child's return is handled expeditiously and in accordance with international standards.Balancing International Obligations with Domestic Law: The integration of the Hague Convention into Pakistani law represents a balance between respecting international legal obligations and the domestic legal framework, particularly in light of Pakistan's cultural, religious, and social norms. It allows Pakistan to fulfill its international commitments while providing flexibility to consider the local context in custody disputes.",

The High Court set aside the lower courts' decisions, holding that the respondent was not entitled to any dower. The suit for recovery of dower filed by the respondent was dismissed.---- Reasoning:The Court noted the established facts of non-consummation of marriage and dissolution via decree under section 10(4)(5) of the Family Courts Act, 1964. The Court relied on Islamic law principles and precedents, including \"Shajar Islam v. Muhammad Siddique\" (PLD 2007 SC 45) and \"Mst. Tayyeba Ambareen and another v. Shafqat Ali Kiyani and another\" (2023 SCMR 246), to conclude that since the marriage was dissolved at the respondent's instance without consummation or valid retirement, she was not entitled to any dower. The Court also highlighted that the petitioner did not pronounce divorce, and the dissolution was through a court decree on the basis of Khula.---- Precedents Cited:\"Shajar Islam v.

The High Court's reliance on established precedents and Islamic jurisprudence illustrates the integration of religious law within Pakistan's legal framework.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, an overseas Pakistani woman, was married to the respondent in 2011. The marriage was registered in both Pakistan and Norway. The respondent later moved to Norway with a spouse visa, and the couple had a child together. In July 2022, the respondent contracted a second marriage in Pakistan without seeking formal permission from the petitioner. This prompted the petitioner to file a complaint under Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO), through her special attorney, seeking action against the respondent for marrying without permission. The Family Court dismissed the complaint for being filed through an attorney, and the Additional District Judge upheld this decision on appeal. The petitioner then filed a constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan. -----Issues: Whether a complaint under Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, can be filed and prosecuted through an attorney. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Filing of Complaint through Attorney: The court held that under criminal law, including Section 6 of the MFLO, complaints and criminal proceedings cannot be initiated or pursued through an attorney. Criminal law requires the personal involvement of the complainant, as the complainant must be someone who has personal knowledge of the facts and can testify to the offense. The court emphasized that criminal matters cannot be delegated to an attorney, as the attorney's testimony would be based on hearsay rather than personal knowledge. Relevance of Family Courts Act, 1964: The court referred to the Family Courts Act, 1964, which governs family matters, including those arising under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961. While the act allows for representation through an agent in certain matters, it does not extend to criminal complaints like the one filed under Section 6 of the MFLO. The court cited relevant precedents that clarified that criminal complaints cannot be filed through attorneys. Dismissal of Petition: The court found that the lower courts were correct in dismissing the complaint for being filed through an attorney. The petitioner failed to show any legal error or irregularity in the lower courts' decisions. As a result, the constitutional petition was dismissed. -----Citations/Precedents: Muzaffar Nawaz v.

His sentences were directed to run consecutively. Akram sought to have his sentences run concurrently through a writ petition at the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, which was granted. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court.---Issue:The main issue was whether the sentences awarded to Akram for the murder of his family members should run consecutively or concurrently.---Judgment:The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the Lahore High Court's judgment that allowed the sentences to run concurrently.---Reasoning:The Supreme Court emphasized that the discretion to direct sentences to run consecutively or concurrently must be exercised based on the facts and circumstances of each case, the nature of the offense, and its gravity. The Court found it unreasonable for the Lahore High Court to have exercised its writ jurisdiction to alter the conditionality of the sentences for such heinous crimes. The Supreme Court also noted that the precedents relied upon by the Lahore High Court were reviewed and upheld by a larger bench, reinforcing the principle of not offering leniency for grave offenses.Citations and Precedents:The judgment referenced several key cases to support its decision, including:Javed Shaikh v. The State (1985 SCMR 153)Shah Muhammad alias Manna v. State (1994 SCMR 582)Bashir v. The State (PLD 1991 SC 1145)Muhammad Arshad v. The State (PLD 2011 SC 310)Ali Khan Kakar v. Hammad Abbasi (2012 SCMR 334)The Court also ordered that the deposited Diyat amount of Rs. 8,50,000 by Akram be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased, as mandated by law.Conclusion:The Supreme Court's decision underscores the judiciary's stance on not mitigating the sentences for severe crimes, particularly those involving the murder of family members, and reaffirms the principle that sentences should reflect the gravity of the offense.Court: ''The discretionary power vested in the Court to direct that the awarded sentences shall run consecutively or concurrently is to be exercised in the light of the facts and circumstances of each case, keeping in view the scope of section 35 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1908, the nature and manner of occurrence and the gravity of the offence. Thus, it seems quite strange and unreasonable that through impugned judgment, the learned Division Bench of the High Court had done away with the conditionality of such sentences to run consecutively while exercising writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, which is equitable and discretionary in nature and not meant to give premium to a criminal for commission of heinous crime.''",

The Lahore High Court upheld this conviction on June 6, 2011. Jamshaid appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which granted leave to appeal on December 14, 2012.--- Issue: Whether the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jamshaid was guilty of the murder of Mirza Yaqoob.---- Holding: The Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed the appeal, setting aside the conviction and sentence, and acquitted Muhammad Jamshaid, granting him the benefit of the doubt.---Reasoning:The Supreme Court observed that the murder was unwitnessed and the prosecution's motive was disbelieved by the trial court. The primary evidence against Jamshaid was the discovery of Yaqoob's body in his house, which was also inhabited by other family members. The Supreme Court found this approach by the lower courts speculative, emphasizing that suspicion, however grave, cannot substitute for the proof required in a criminal case. The Court noted the absence of evidence directly linking Jamshaid to the murder and criticized the lower courts for concluding that the prosecution had met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.---Conclusion:The Supreme Court highlighted the need for courts to rely on concrete evidence rather than speculation in criminal cases. By acquitting Jamshaid due to the lack of direct evidence against him, the Court underscored the principle that the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, a cornerstone of criminal jurisprudence.",

It noted inconsistencies in the petitioner's claims regarding the return of dowry articles through a 'panchiat' (community council) and the absence of written proof for such return. The court found no misreading, non-reading, or illegality in the impugned judgments and emphasized that the appraisal of evidence is primarily the function of the Family Court. The court also addressed the petitioner's objection regarding the non-appearance of the respondent in person, stating that her representation by a special attorney who withstood cross-examination was sufficient, and the procedural norms for family suits do not necessitate the personal appearance of the claimant.---Conclusion:The Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, dismissed the petition for lack of merit, upholding the concurrent findings of the lower courts regarding the partial decree for the recovery of dowry articles in favor of the respondent.",

The court reasoned that:The jurisdiction for divorce matters lies with the Union Council where the wife was residing at the time of the divorce pronouncement. In this case, both the petitioner and his wife were residing in Germany, placing the jurisdiction with the Pakistani Mission in Germany as per S.R.O.No.1086(K)61.The Islamabad High Court's ruling striking down the S.R.O. does not affect its applicability in Punjab, as judicial decisions are confined to the territorial jurisdiction of the issuing court.----Conclusion:The Lahore High Court found that the Union Council in Lahore lacked jurisdiction over the petitioner's divorce proceedings, given the couple's residence in Germany. The court upheld the procedural requirements and jurisdictional mandates of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, and associated rules, leading to the dismissal of the petition for a divorce effectiveness certificate.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The original suit filed by Mat. Zebun Nisa and her daughter sought declaration for their shares in the property against their dower and legal/sharia rights, respectively. The defendants resisted the suit, leading to multiple remands and the eventual dismissal of the suit.---Issue:Whether the offer by plaintiff No.1 (Mat. Zebun Nisa) to resolve the dispute through an oath on the Holy Quran and the subsequent acceptance and fulfillment of this offer by the defendants barred plaintiff No.1 from pursuing her claim further?Whether plaintiff No.2 (Ms. Hurmat) had a competent claim to her share in the property during the lifetime of Muhammad Sherin (her grandfather), given the provisions of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961?---Holding:The court held that plaintiff No.1 was estopped from pressing her claim further due to her offer to resolve the dispute through an oath, which was accepted and fulfilled by the defendants.The court found plaintiff No.2's claim to be incompetent and premature, as she had no locus standi to claim her share in the property during the lifetime of her grandfather, Muhammad Sherin.--Reasoning:The court reasoned that the principle of estoppel and the doctrine of election barred plaintiff No.1 from retracting her offer, which was duly accepted and fulfilled by the defendants. Additionally, the court referenced multiple precedents, including the Supreme Court cases, to reinforce the doctrines of estoppel, election, and the rights of property owners to alienate their property. For plaintiff No.2, the court noted that the suit was filed during the lifetime of Muhammad Sherin, making her claim for a share in his property incompetent and premature, as her legal right to inheritance had not yet materialized.---Rule of Law:The judgment relied on the principles of estoppel and election to bar claims that have been resolved by mutual agreement or where the claimant has made a definitive choice in resolving a dispute. It also emphasized the legal right of a property owner to alienate their property and the timing of inheritance claims under the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961.---Precedents relied by the court: Stir Miviib-Rehman Muhammad Hassani Washuk and others (PLD 2020 Supreme Court 718): This case established that once a litigant has chosen a certain course of action or abandoned a particular plea, they cannot reopen the matter simply because the initial choice did not yield favorable results.---Silver Star Insurance Company Limited Lahore through Chief Executive Vs. Messrs Kamal Pipes Industries, Lahore and another (2028 CLD 1342, Lahore): This case likely deals with the principles of estoppel and/or the finality of decisions made based on chosen remedies.---Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited Vs. Devan Sugar Mills Limited and others (PLD 2018 Supreme Court 828): This case might discuss the implications of legal choices and the consequences of such choices on subsequent legal actions.---Lucky Cement Ltd. through Authorized Attorney Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Revenue Division and 03 others (2021 PTD 835): This precedent might be related to the legal doctrine of estoppel or the principles governing the finality of decisions in commercial or tax-related disputes.----Ghulam Muhammad Vs. Mian Muhammad and another (2007 SCMR 231): This case affirmed the right of a Muslim owner to dispose of their property by way of gift, and such action cannot be contested by the heirs who are deprived of their shares as a result.---Br. Muhammad Javaid Shah Vs. Syed Rashid Arshad and others (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 212): This case likely discusses the principles of estoppel and waiver, particularly in the context of failing to object to a fact or action that could affect one's legal rights.",

When the provisions of sections 16 to 20 of the C.P.C. stand excluded from the proceedings before the Family Court then, the question of its territorial jurisdiction would never arise, provided that the Family Court where the wife resides, shall have the exclusive jurisdiction over all such matters as Rule 6 of the West Pakistan Family Court Rules, 1965 so provides.''---Background:Mst. Yasmeen Bibi filed two suits in the Family Court, Multan, following her divorce from Muhammad Ghazanfar Khan. The suits were for the recovery of arrears of maintenance, dower, and dowry articles. The divorce, pronounced thrice, was deemed irrevocable. The Family Court ruled in favor of Bibi, including a decree for the land promised in the marriage contract. However, the District Appeal Court modified this decree, excluding the land and dowry articles. The Lahore High Court upheld this decision, deeming such issues beyond the Family Court's jurisdiction, which Bibi challenged in the Supreme Court.Issue:Whether the Family Court has jurisdiction over matrimonial disputes involving dower, maintenance, and dowry articles, including property stipulated in the marriage contract.Judgment:The Supreme Court, led by Justice Dost Muhammad Khan, overturned the decisions of the lower courts. It was held that the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over all matrimonial disputes, as per the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964, and subsequent amendments aimed at expediting such cases. The Court emphasized the legislative intent to provide a streamlined process for matrimonial disputes to avoid lengthy litigation in Civil Courts. The Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, for decision on merit, in accordance with their findings.Key Points:The Supreme Court confirmed the Family Court's exclusive jurisdiction over matrimonial disputes, including property issues stipulated in marriage contracts.The judgment highlighted the legislative intent behind the establishment of Family Courts and subsequent amendments to ensure the expedited resolution of matrimonial disputes.The Supreme Court's decision underscores the importance of interpreting statutory laws in a manner that aligns with legislative intent and the practical realities faced by litigants in matrimonial disputes.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:This case concerns the interpretation of Section 4 of the Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, regarding the inheritance rights of grandchildren through their predeceased parents. The appellant, Mst. Zainab, is the granddaughter of Sufaid Khan, who passed away in 1972, leaving behind his estate. Zainab, being the daughter of Raju (Sufaid Khan's predeceased son), was transferred the entire estate after Raju's death. Kamal Khan, claiming to be the nephew and therefore a legal heir of Sufaid Khan, contested this transfer, asserting his ownership of the property. The case escalated from the trial court to the Lahore High Court and finally to the Supreme Court.----Issues:The primary issue was whether the intention of the lawmaker in Section 4 of the Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, was solely to ensure that children of a predeceased son or daughter of the deceased (propositus) are entitled only to the Islamic Law shares they would inherit from their direct parent, and not to increase their share beyond what Islamic Law prescribes.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court held that the interpretation of Section 4 of the Ordinance by the High Court was correct. It was determined that the intention of the law was not to enhance the shares of the grandchildren beyond what is prescribed by Islamic Law, but rather to ensure they are not deprived of their rightful share through their predeceased parent. The Court emphasized that the law must operate fairly and equitably, aligning with the principles of Islamic Inheritance Law, which prioritizes closer kin in the distribution of an estate. Consequently, Mst. Zainab was entitled only to the share her father would have inherited, not the entire estate of Sufaid Khan. The appeal was dismissed, and each party was ordered to bear their own costs.----Citations/Precedents:Mst. Zarina Jan v. Mst. Akbar Jan [PLD 1975 Pesh. 252]: Referenced to support the appellant's argument regarding the interpretation of Section 4 of the Ordinance.Yusuf Abbas v. Ismat Mustafa [PLD 1968 Kar. 480]: Cited to support the appellant's contention on the literal interpretation of the Ordinance's provisions.Ibrahim v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Facts: Syed Amir Raza (petitioner) and Mst. Rohi Mumtaz (respondent) were married on October 20, 2017, with the dower agreed upon as 50 tolas of gold ornaments and a house. After facing unpleasant and cruel treatment from the petitioner, the respondent filed for dissolution of marriage on the ground of khula on September 22, 2018, which was granted by the Family Court on November 28, 2018, with the condition of the respondent surrendering 50% of her deferred dower and 25% of her prompt dower. The respondent also filed a suit for recovery of dower, maintenance, and dowry articles, which was partially decreed in her favor by the trial court on August 27, 2020. Both parties appealed the trial court's decision, but the appellate court dismissed the appeals on March 31, 2022. The petitioner's subsequent writ petition was dismissed by the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, on June 13, 2022, leading to this petition for leave to appeal.---Issue: Whether the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, erred in dismissing the writ petition challenging the appellate court's decision regarding the recovery of dower, maintenance, and dowry articles.---Holding: The Supreme Court allowed the petition, converting it into an appeal, and modified the impugned order regarding the deferred dower, holding that the respondent is entitled to only fifty percent (50%) share in the house (deferred dower) or its market value.---Reasoning: The Supreme Court observed that the trial court's judgment on August 27, 2020, disregarded its earlier judgment on November 28, 2018, which directed the respondent to surrender 50% of her deferred dower upon obtaining a khula dissolution. The Court noted that the house mentioned in the Nikahnama as deferred dower should only entitle the respondent to fifty percent (50%) of its share or market value, in line with Section 10(5) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, which stipulates that a wife must forego a portion of her dower in the case of khula. The Supreme Court referenced its judgment in Muhammad Arif v. Saima Noreen (2015 SCMR 804) to support this position.----Judgment: Petition allowed; impugned order modified regarding the deferred dower entitlement.---Commentary: This case underscores the application of Section 10(5) of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, in cases of marriage dissolution through khula, particularly regarding the division of deferred dower. It highlights the judiciary's role in ensuring equitable distribution of matrimonial assets upon dissolution of marriage while adhering to statutory requirements and previous judicial precedents.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:The appellant, Amanullah, along with two co-accused, was tried for the murder of Din Muhammad, the brother of the complainant, under Sections 302/34 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) following an FIR registered on 31.05.2011. The Trial Court acquitted the co-accused but convicted Amanullah under Section 302(b) PPC, sentencing him to death and a fine of Rs.200,000 as compensation to the deceased's heirs, with a default sentence of six months in case of non-payment. The Lahore High Court upheld the conviction but commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment, maintaining the compensation and default sentence, and extending the benefit of Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) to the appellant. Aggrieved by this judgment, Amanullah appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan.---Facts:On 31.05.2011, the complainant, along with the deceased and others, visited the residence of his maternal uncle. The appellant, armed and accompanied by others, arrived at the scene. Following a provocation, Amanullah shot Din Muhammad, causing fatal injuries. The motive was rooted in a matrimonial dispute involving the complainant, his sister, and the appellant's family.---Legal Proceedings:The prosecution presented eleven witnesses, while the appellant denied all allegations, also providing a defense witness. The appellant's counsel highlighted contradictions in the prosecution's case, including the credibility of eyewitnesses, delayed postmortem, and unproven motive. Conversely, the state and complainant's counsel argued the credibility and presence of the eyewitnesses, the naturalness of their presence at the crime scene, and the consistency of ocular and medical evidence.---Judgment:Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, delivering the judgment, meticulously analyzed the evidence. The court noted the prompt reporting of the crime, the daylight occurrence ensuring no misidentification, and the reasonable explanation of the eyewitnesses' presence. The court found the ocular account reliable, supported by medical evidence, dismissing the defense's arguments about the postmortem delay and the credibility of the complainant's testimony due to familial relations.",

The Court found no evidence of fraud or forgery and noted that Ghause did not pursue any legal action against the alleged wrongdoers. The Court also rejected Ghause's argument that the stipulation was against Islamic injunctions, noting that such agreements are permissible and do not restrict the right to divorce or remarry.----Reasoning:The Court reasoned that the stipulations in the Nikah Nama were agreed upon by both parties and were akin to deferred dower, becoming payable upon specific events like divorce or remarriage. The Court found no jurisdictional error or blatant illegality in the lower courts' decisions and emphasized the finality of appellate courts' findings to prevent unnecessary litigation.---Disposition:Petition dismissed for lack of merit.---Key Points:Stipulations in a Nikah Nama regarding additional dower in the event of divorce or remarriage are enforceable if agreed upon by both parties.Claims of fraud or forgery in marriage contracts must be substantiated with evidence and legal action against the alleged perpetrators.The Lahore High Court emphasizes the importance of respecting the finality of appellate courts' decisions to ensure the expeditious resolution of family disputes.",

It directed the Prosecutor General to convene a meeting with senior police officials and the Director General of Local Government and Community Development to develop a more comprehensive mechanism.

The trial court convicted Ishtiaq Hussain under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code, sentencing him to death, while acquitting his sons.

The criminal petition seeking reversal of acquittals and reinstatement of the death penalty was dismissed.----Reasoning:The Court found discrepancies between the ocular accounts and medical evidence, notably regarding the nature of Muhammad Shoaib's injury, which was testified as a stab wound but medically recorded as a gunshot wound.The collective accusation against Ishtiaq Hussain and his sons, with the fatal assault described as involving only a single gunshot, was viewed skeptically by the Court, suggesting an overzealous attempt to implicate the entire family.The prosecution's narrative, including the positioning of the accused during the shooting, was found implausible and inconsistent with the initial crime report and autopsy findings.The Court concluded that the prosecution's case was fraught with doubts, leading to the failure to meet the required standard of proof for criminal conviction.----Judgment: The criminal appeal was allowed, resulting in the acquittal of Ishtiaq Hussain due to insufficient and unreliable evidence.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: The case presented revolves around the petitioner's appeal against his conviction under section 6(5)(b) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, for contracting a second marriage without permission. The petitioner argues that under Muslim personal law, he has the right to marry up to four times without limitation and that his first wife had given him consent for the second marriage. The court first delves into the validity of section 6 of the Ordinance, which requires prior permission from the Arbitration Council for a man to contract another marriage during the subsistence of an existing one. They cite previous rulings and Quranic verses to establish that the condition of justice (adal) prescribed in Islam should be satisfied in polygamous situations. They conclude that section 6 of the Ordinance does not violate Islamic injunctions. Marbury v. Madison (1803): This landmark case established the principle of judicial review in the United States, empowering federal courts to review the constitutionality of legislative and executive actions. Brown v. Board of Education (1954): In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, overturning the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). Miranda v. Arizona (1966): This case established the requirement for law enforcement officials to inform suspects of their constitutional rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney, during custodial interrogations. Roe v. Wade (1973): In this case, the Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy, legalizing abortion nationwide. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963): The Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of legal counsel applies to state criminal defendants, establishing the principle that states must provide counsel for defendants who cannot afford to hire their own. These cases represent significant legal precedents that have shaped the development of law and influenced subsequent court decisions. They illustrate how judicial rulings can have far-reaching implications for society and the legal system as a whole.Regarding the specific case, the petitioner failed to seek permission for his second marriage as required by law. The court dismisses his claim of obtaining consent from his first wife due to lack of evidence.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Bail granted --- Issue: Whether a company and its CEO can be held criminally liable for dishonestly issuing a bad cheque under section 489-F of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).----Facts: NORD, a family-owned limited liability company, with the petitioner as its CEO and one of its directors, is involved in a transaction with DSML. DSML alleges that a cheque issued by NORD, represented by the petitioner, was dishonored, leading to the filing of FIR No. 73/2019 against the petitioner and NORD. The petitioner asserts that the FIR is motivated by malice.---Legal Doctrine and Analysis:---Identification Doctrine: The legal doctrine states that a corporation acts through its officers and agents, and their actions and intent may be attributed to the corporation itself. The controlling individuals within a company, such as directors or managers, are considered the company's \"directing mind and will.\"---Criminal Liability of Corporations: In the context of criminal liability, corporations can be held accountable for the actions of their officers and agents, subject to certain exceptions. The liability depends on the role, position, and authority of the individuals within the company, and proof of mens rea is necessary for penal consequences.---Interpretation of Statute: The term \"whoever\" in section 489-F PPC encompasses all offenders without distinction, including both natural and juristic persons, allowing for the prosecution of corporations.----Decision: The court accepts the petitioner's contention that the FIR may be motivated by malice. Pre-arrest bail is confirmed for the petitioner, subject to furnishing a bail bond.---Conclusion: The court affirms that both the petitioner, as CEO of NORD, and the company itself can be prosecuted for the alleged offence under section 489-F PPC. The decision is based on the application of the identification doctrine and the interpretation of the relevant statute, which allows for the prosecution of corporations for criminal offences.",

The FIR narrates an event on 24.9.2023, where Kousar Bibi was apprehended with 1420 grams of charas. Subsequent to this, allegations surfaced about the police, especially regarding a historical grudge from an incident in 2016 involving the petitioner's family. An inquiry revealed mixed findings about the police's conduct, leading to the current legal proceedings.-----Issues:The validity of the post-arrest bail request by Kousar Bibi given the circumstances of her arrest and the evidence presented.The impact of historical grievances and police conduct on the current case.The role of video evidence in ensuring transparency and accountability in narcotics control enforcement.-----Holding/Reasoning:The court granted Kousar Bibi post-arrest bail, subject to furnishing a bail bond worth Rs. 500,000 with two sureties. The decision was influenced by the lack of a criminal record for Kousar Bibi, the historical context of police conduct towards her family, and the broader implications of ensuring fairness in law enforcement. The court emphasized the importance of videography in narcotics control operations to prevent false accusations and enhance evidence integrity. It directed law enforcement to adopt technological tools like body-worn and dashboard cameras, and to ensure all operations are videotaped.----Directions on Videography:The court directed the government to equip the Punjab Police with body-worn and dashboard cameras to foster public trust, facilitate investigations, and support court proceedings. This includes mandatory videography of all police operations, particularly those involving narcotics, to prevent false accusations and ensure the integrity of the evidence collected. The Punjab Safe Cities Authority was highlighted for its role in crime control through modern technology, with instructions to extend such infrastructural support to more cities and ensure the availability of CCTV footage for investigative purposes.----Citations/Precedents:The international conventions on narcotics control and human rights, including the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988), alongside human rights treaties like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.Supreme Court of India's acknowledgment of videography's importance in Shafhi Mohammad vs State of Himachal Pradesh (2018) 5 SCC 311.Supreme Court of Pakistan's stance on videography in law enforcement in Zahid Sarfaraz Gill vs The State (Criminal Petition No. 1192 of 2023).Provisions within the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997, emphasizing the procedural integrity in narcotics seizure and legal proceedings.",

The appellant, Syeda Sakina Riaz, sought family pension following her husband's death in a car accident. Her husband, an Assistant Controller at the University of Karachi, had served for only about five years, falling short of the minimum qualifying service for pension under the University's regulations. The appellant claimed entitlement to family pension under the Prime Minister?s Family Assistance Package.----Issues:Whether the appellant is entitled to family pension under the Prime Minister?s Family Assistance Package despite her husband not meeting the minimum qualifying service requirement for pension under the University of Karachi Service Pension Statute, 1972.Whether the appellant's petition seeking family pension is maintainable considering her husband's service tenure and the university's pension regulations.----Holding/Reasoning:The Supreme Court held that entitlement to pension, including family pension, is contingent upon an employee meeting the minimum qualifying service requirement. The Court emphasized that pension rights are earned benefits, not akin to insurance policies. Therefore, the appellant's late husband, having not fulfilled the minimum qualifying service, did not qualify for pension, including family pension. The Court further noted that the family assistance package merely enhanced pensionary benefits but did not convert non-pensionable service into pensionable service. As the appellant's husband had served for only five years, well short of the requisite tenure, the appellant was not entitled to claim family pension. Thus, the Court dismissed the appeal.----Citations/Precedents:University of Karachi Service Pension Statute, 1972 - Referenced for the minimum qualifying service requirement for pension eligibility.Prime Minister?s Family Assistance Package - Discussed in relation to its applicability to employees' families but not overriding pension regulations.Principles of pension entitlement - Emphasized the need for employees to fulfill minimum qualifying service for pension eligibility.----Quote:The right to claim pension is a right connected with the tenure of service which under the applicable pension rules has to be served by an employee in order to make him eligible for pension. Where a deceased employee has put in pensionable service, only then his family becomes entitled to pension.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:This case involves multiple petitions filed by Ibrahim Khan against judgments made by the Peshawar High Court, Abbottabad Bench. The High Court had dismissed Ibrahim Khan's writ petition and allowed those filed by Respondent No.1, Mst. Saima Khan. The dispute originated from two suits filed by Mst. Saima Khan in 2014, seeking dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty, recovery of dowry articles, maintenance, and possession of a house or its market value. The trial court decreed dissolution of marriage based on khula, subject to waiver of dower (half portion of the house), awarded maintenance, and partially decreed the recovery of dowry articles. The appellate court later enhanced the maintenance and dowry article costs. Mst. Saima Khan challenged these decisions, arguing that she never sought khula but dissolution on grounds of cruelty and demanded her dower. The High Court agreed, noting evidence that Ibrahim Khan had already divorced her, making the grant of khula unnecessary and upholding her right to dower.Issues:The central issue was whether a court could convert a plea for dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty into a plea for dissolution by khula when khula was not explicitly sought by the wife. Additionally, the case questioned whether Mst. Saima Khan was entitled to dower if the dissolution was based on khula or cruelty.-----Holding/Reasoning:The Supreme Court held that khula is a specific right available to women, which requires explicit consent to waive dower. As Mst. Saima Khan did not seek khula and instead sought dissolution on grounds of cruelty under DMMA, the trial and appellate courts erred in granting khula and making her waive her dower. The Supreme Court found that the High Court's judgment, which recognized that Ibrahim Khan had already divorced Mst. Saima Khan and upheld her right to dower, was in accordance with the law. The Supreme Court also noted that whether through divorce or dissolution on grounds of cruelty, Mst. Saima Khan was entitled to her dower. The factual findings regarding maintenance and dowry articles by the lower courts were not contested for legal interference.------Citations/Precedents:Principles of Mahomedan Law by Dinshah Fardunji Mulla, specifically Paragraph Nos. 319(2) and 320, detailing the concept of khula and its implications on dower.Khurshid Bibi v.

The Court found that the Release Deed was indeed secured through fraud and misrepresentation by Ihtisham-ul-Haq, who was in a dominant position and manipulated his sisters into signing the document under the pretense that it was for the transfer of the property to all legal heirs. The evidence suggested that no consideration was paid to the sisters for relinquishing their shares, nor was there any family settlement to justify the execution of the Release Deed. The Supreme Court emphasized that a release deed and a gift deed are distinct instruments with specific legal requirements, and in this case, the elements of a valid gift were absent.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:Pakistan is facing a severe population growth crisis, with its population projected to reach 306 million by 2050 if the current growth rate continues unchecked. This rapid population growth has led to numerous challenges, including poverty, famine, unemployment, high mortality rates, and inadequate access to basic amenities like clean water and education. Despite historical efforts to implement family planning programs, progress has been hindered by factors such as religious opposition and centralization of efforts.---Issues:Whether Pakistan's population growth crisis constitutes a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution?What measures can be taken to address the population growth crisis and promote family planning effectively?---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court held that Pakistan's population growth crisis indeed constitutes a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including the right to life and access to basic amenities. The court reasoned that unchecked population growth undermines the country's socio-economic progress and threatens the well-being of its citizens. To address this crisis, the court recommended various measures, including increasing access to contraceptives, implementing conditional cash transfer schemes for family planning, integrating family planning services into healthcare facilities, and incorporating family planning education into medical and nursing curricula. The court emphasized the urgent need for collaborative efforts from all stakeholders, including government agencies, religious leaders, civil society, and the public, to effectively tackle the population growth crisis.---Citations/Precedents:Proclamation of Teheran, 1968Barrister Zafarullah Khan Vs.

Asim appealed the decision, and the Appellate Court modified the judgment by increasing the maintenance amount annually by ten percent and awarding additional haq mehr to Samro Begum.Asim and Samro Begum both filed writ petitions before the Peshawar High Court, which were dismissed.---Issues:Whether the Appellate Court had jurisdiction to modify the judgment in favor of Samro Begum and her daughter, despite them not filing cross-objections.Whether the increase in maintenance and the award of haq mehr were justified.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Appellate Court had jurisdiction to modify the judgment in favor of Samro Begum and her daughter, even without cross-objections, under Rule 33 of Order XLI of the Code of Civil Procedure.The increase in maintenance by ten percent annually was reasonable to account for inflation, and the award of haq mehr was based on evidence presented.Muhammad Asim's intentional non-disclosure of his earnings warranted an adverse inference against him. His failure to disclose his salary suggested that the awarded maintenance was well within his means.The petition for leave to appeal lacked merit, and leave was declined. The petition was dismissed with costs awarded to Samro Begum.---Citations/Precedents:Family Courts Act, 1964---Quote:An appellate court, in an appeal against the judgment of family court, has the power to modify the judgment and decree of family court by relying on Order XLI Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:Saif-ur-Rehman, the appellant, and Respondent No.3 were married, but their matrimonial relationship ended in dissolution. Respondent No.3 filed a suit for the dissolution of marriage and for the return of dowry articles. The suit for dissolution of marriage was decreed, and the marriage was dissolved. Another suit for the return of dowry articles was also decreed, with the amount initially set at Rs. 25,000. Respondent No.3 appealed this decision, and the appellate court enhanced the amount to Rs. 4,00,000. Saif-ur-Rehman then filed a writ petition, which led to the reduction of the dowry amount to Rs. 3,00,000. Saif-ur-Rehman appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.---Issues:Whether the appellate court had jurisdiction to enhance the dowry amount.Whether the wife's right to appeal is curtailed under Section 14(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, if the amount awarded is less than the specified limit.---Holding/Reasoning:The Supreme Court held that the appellate court had the jurisdiction to enhance the dowry amount. Section 14(2) of the Family Courts Act, 1964, curtails the husband's right to appeal if the amount awarded is less than the specified limit. However, this provision does not extinguish the wife's right to appeal if she is dissatisfied with any decree in a suit for dower or dowry. The Court emphasized the gender-sensitive nature of the Family Courts Act and the need to interpret it liberally to advance its beneficial objectives.---Outcome:The appeal was dismissed as devoid of merit.---Precedents/Citations:Tayyaba Yunus v.

Before the charge could be framed, the petitioner's counsel claimed that he was unfit to stand trial due to his mental illness. After an inquiry and medical examination confirming his mental state, the trial court postponed the proceedings and ordered his detention in a mental health hospital instead of granting bail. The High Court upheld this decision, leading to the current petition for leave to appeal. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court exercised its discretion reasonably under Section 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by choosing to detain the petitioner in a mental health facility rather than releasing him on sufficient security. 2- The principles that should guide the exercise of discretion in such cases. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court held that the primary course under Section 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is to release an accused of unsound mind on sufficient security, with detention as an exception. In this case, the court found no justification for detaining Khan in a mental health facility given his family's readiness to ensure his care and prevent harm to himself or others. The Supreme Court found the trial court's discretion to be exercised unreasonably and capriciously. Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the lower courts, and ordered Khan's release on bail under specific conditions. ----Citations/Precedents: Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (PPC) regarding blasphemy laws.Sections 465 and 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (CrPC) concerning the procedure for dealing with accused persons of unsound mind.Lunacy Act, 1912, which provides rules for the detention of mentally unsound individuals.FIR No.227/21, Police Station Shafiq Abad, Lahore, which initiated the case.",

Respondent No.1 was declared the Returned Candidate. The Appellant challenged Respondent No.1's nomination papers, alleging false declaration of assets. The Election Tribunal dismissed the petition, prompting the current appeal.---Issues:Whether Respondent No.1's failure to disclose all assets warrants his disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.Whether the Election Tribunal's judgment dismissing the petition was sustainable in light of the evidence presented.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court found that Respondent No.1 failed to disclose all of his assets, including land holdings, in his nomination papers. Despite Respondent No.1's argument of misunderstanding and family settlement arrangements, the court held that the omission amounted to a false declaration of assets. Citing precedents such as Speaker, National Assembly of Pakistan v. Habib Akram (PLD 2018 SC 678) and Muhammad Ahmad Chatta v. Iftikhar Ahmad Cheema (2016 SCMR 763), the court reasoned that intentional misstatement or concealment of assets justifies disqualification under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution. Therefore, the court set aside the Election Tribunal's judgment, declared Respondent No.1's nomination invalid, and ordered fresh elections in the constituency.---Citations/Precedents:Speaker, National Assembly of Pakistan v.

After the Partition of British India in 1947, the properties were declared evacuee and allotted to displaced persons. However, in 1948, the family of the deceased owner applied for restoration of the properties under Section 17 of the West Punjab Protection of Evacuee Property Act of 1948, which was granted subject to certain conditions.---Issues:Whether properties declared as evacuee, which were later restored to the original owners, could re-acquire the status of evacuee property due to the movements of some or all of the owners.Whether the restoration order was subject to reasonable conditions and whether there was any evidence of mala fide action by the Custodian.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court held that once the properties were restored to the original owners, they ceased to be evacuee property unless certain conditions were satisfied, such as the owners' absence from West Punjab. The power of the Custodian to impose conditions on restoration was subject to the condition of reasonableness. In this case, the restoration order was subject to reasonable conditions, and there was no dispute regarding the title after restoration. Additionally, there was no evidence of mala fide action by the Custodian. Therefore, the Court upheld the impugned judgment, concluding that the disputed properties had re-acquired the status of evacuee property due to the movements of some of the owners.

The plaintiffs, legal heirs of Muhammad Din, argued that while their predecessor sold 126 Kanal 10 Marla of land to Abdullah, the sale did not include the Shamlat of Caste Sikhani, which they maintained possession of. However, during consolidation proceedings, the Shamlat land was erroneously transferred to the defendants, the legal heirs of Abdullah, prompting the plaintiffs to seek legal redress to reverse this transfer and assert their rights.-----Issues:Whether the Shamlat land of Caste Sikhani in Moza Tubb was legally transferred to the defendants as part of the sale of land by Muhammad Din to Abdullah.The validity of the mutations and transactions conducted by the defendants within the family, which the plaintiffs alleged were mala fide.Whether the civil court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on matters related to the consolidation of land and the correction of entries in the revenue record.-----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Lahore High Court held that the Shamlat land was not included in the original sale transaction, as evidenced by the absence of any mention of Shamlat land in the sale deed and subsequent mutations. The court relied on the West Pakistan Dispositions (Saving of Shamilat) Ordinance, 1959, which stipulates that Shamlat land cannot be presumed to be part of any land disposition unless explicitly mentioned. The appellate court's decision to decree the suit in favor of the plaintiffs was upheld, with the court noting that the plaintiffs remained in possession of the Shamlat land and that every new entry in the revenue record creates a fresh cause of action.

The court reasoned that while medical science supports different ages of puberty for males and females, this does not justify different legal ages for marriage. The government is empowered to set a minimum age for marriage, and doing so is within its constitutional powers. The court directed the Government of Punjab to issue and publish a revised version of the 1929 Act in accordance with the judgment.-----Citations/Precedents:Reference to Islamic jurisprudence on the age of puberty.UNICEF data on child marriage in Pakistan.Article 35 of the Constitution, which mandates state protection for marriage, family, mothers, and children, supporting the legislation against child marriage.Article 25(1) of the Constitution, which mandates equality before the law and prohibits discrimination based on sex.The decision reflects principles of affirmative action, acknowledging special provisions for the protection of women and children but emphasizing that such provisions should not lead to discrimination.----Conclusion: The court emphasized the detrimental effects of child marriage on education, health, and the socioeconomic status of girls, supporting the legislative intent to prevent child marriage. The judgment aligns with constitutional mandates to protect children and women and ensures equal treatment before the law, irrespective of gender.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:In the Lahore High Court case No. CO No.74580/2023, Sohail Nisar initiated a legal proceeding against Nadeem Nisar and others concerning disputes over a family business. The family business, governed by an informal set of rules, became the center of conflict due to allegations between the brothers and a breakdown of trust, primarily driven by significant financial interests. The court observed that the resolution of this dispute would require complex orders, potentially leading to the severance of the brothers' commercial relationship and impacting their personal relations and the business detrimentally.----Issues:How to resolve the family business dispute without causing irreparable damage to personal relationships and the business itself.Whether mediation is an appropriate method for dispute resolution in this case.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court proposed mediation as a means to resolve the dispute, supported by statutory backing from Order IX-B of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended by the Lahore High Court in 2018. This approach aligns with the judicial precedent that mandates mediation in cases where it's deemed feasible and beneficial, especially in family disputes involving business matters. Justice Mushir Alam, a former Supreme Court Judge, was appointed as the mediator to facilitate the resolution process focusing on allegations related to specific business transactions and the future managerial structure of ATS Synthetic (Pvt.)

The Taxation Officer added amounts withdrawn from a firm and gifts received under relevant sections of the Ordinance.---Issues:Whether the Taxation Officer was justified in adding amounts withdrawn from the firm and gifts received by the respondent under specific sections of the Income Tax Ordinance.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court found no merit in the appeal. It analyzed the relevant sections of the Income Tax Ordinance and concluded that the provisions were not applicable to the transactions in question. The Court noted that no cash had exchanged hands, and the transactions were reflected in book entries without immediate transfer of funds. Thus, it affirmed the lower courts' decisions.

The documents lacked credibility and validity, and it was concluded that Zahida Sabir's rights were not lawfully relinquished. The Court emphasized the importance of upholding the rights of vulnerable family members, especially women, in matters of inheritance.

The incident occurred during a gathering of family elders to settle disputes between Mehboob Alam and his wife, who was the sister of the petitioner.

Despite the absence of casings from the crime scene, forensic evidence confirmed the presence of human blood, validating the occurrence of the incident. The autopsy report corroborated the use of the weapon recovered from the petitioner. The prompt reporting and subsequent medical examinations were deemed adequate. Hakeem Nazeer Ahmad, an independent witness, testified to the events and was found credible. The prosecution's evidence, coupled with witness testimony, left no room for doubt regarding the petitioner's guilt. The defense's alternate theories were rejected as unsubstantiated.

However, a forensic examination by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) yielded negative results, failing to link the petitioner to the alleged dissemination of explicit material. The Investigating Officer exonerated the petitioner based on this report.The court found that although there may be animosity between the petitioner and the complainant, independent evidence is required to sustain the charge.

The petitioners argued that the cases had been improperly assigned to the Family Court, which, as per the Family Courts Act, 1964, should only handle family-related disputes.----Issues:Whether civil cases unrelated to family matters can be legally assigned to a Family Court that primarily handles family disputes under the Family Courts Act, 1964.Whether the transfer of civil cases to the Family Court exceeded the jurisdictional authority granted under the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Lahore High Court allowed the civil revision, setting aside the District Judge's order. The court held that the Family Court, designated under the Family Courts Act, 1964, possesses exclusive jurisdiction to handle only those matters specified within the Act. Civil cases that do not fall under the Act's specified categories cannot be transferred to or decided by the Family Court. The court emphasized that the jurisdictional boundaries set by the Family Courts Act and the Punjab Civil Courts Ordinance must be respected, indicating that civil matters unrelated to family issues should be handled by civil courts with general jurisdiction.-----Citations/Precedents:Mian Umar Ikram-Ul-Haque vs. Dr. Shahida Hasnain and another [2016 SCMR 2186]Mirza Daud Baig vs. Additional District Judge, Gujranwala and others [1987 SCMR 1161]Piao Gul vs. The State [PLD 1960 Supreme Court (Pak.) 307]Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:In the High Court of Sindh, Karachi, a common order was issued to address two Criminal Revision Applications, No. 219 of 2021 and No. 262 of 2022. These applications were related to disputes over property ownership and possession involving family members. The dispute primarily concerned the legal standing of a gift deed and subsequent possession of a property originally owned by Iftikhar, now deceased. After Iftikhar's death, his brother Muhammad Aijaz (respondent No.1), who was gifted the property, faced opposition from another brother, Niaz Ahmed (applicant No.1), and his wife (applicant No.2).-----Issues:Whether the proceedings under the Illegal Dispossession Act 2005 were applicable to a family dispute involving property claimed as inherited.Whether the gift deed favoring Muhammad Aijaz was valid and the subsequent actions taken under it were lawful.Whether the applicants were wrongfully dispossessing Muhammad Aijaz, justifying the enforcement of the Illegal Dispossession Act.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court dismissed the Criminal Revision Applications, upholding the decisions made by the lower court. The court found that the proceedings under the Illegal Dispossession Act were correctly applied despite the familial relationship among the parties. It was emphasized that the Act could be invoked against anyone unlawfully dispossessing or attempting to grab property, not just against external land grabbers or \"Qabza Mafia.\" The court supported the legitimacy of the gift deed granted to Muhammad Aijaz, noting the failure of the applicants to pursue civil remedies effectively, including a dismissed suit challenging the deed.----Citations/Precedents:Mumtaz Hussain vs. Dr. Nasir Khan and others [2010 S C M R 1254]: Discussed the Illegal Dispossession Act?s scope and enforcement.Muhammad Akram and 9 others vs. Muhammad Yousuf and another [2009 SCMR 1066]: Emphasized the mandatory and salutary provisions of the Illegal Dispossession Act.Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Matrimonial dispute, recall of khula decree---Interference under Section 12(2), Code of Civil Procedure, 1908---Petition challenging the recall of khula decree on grounds of misrepresentation---Petitioner, Fozia Mazhar, contested the reinstatement of marriage decree originally dissolved on grounds of khula, which was recalled on a purported joint application, later claimed to be misrepresented---Family Court initially granted dissolution based on khula with dower return, subsequently reversed on alleged joint application, despite lack of respondent?s signature or proper representation---High Courts upheld the decision, confirming no misrepresentation in the initial decree recall---Evidence from attorney and witnesses of the respondent supported claims of no compromise or consent for the joint application, leading to restoration of original khula decree---Supreme Court found no grounds to interfere with concurrent findings of lower courts, thereby dismissing the appeal and upholding the original dissolution of marriage. Key judicial precedents cited included Muhammad Arshad Anjum v. Mst. Khurshid Begum and others (2021 SCMR 1145), and Allah Dad v. Mukhtar and another (1992 SCMR 1273)---Petition dismissed, confirming no misrepresentation in recalling of khula decree.-----Issues:Whether Section 12(2) of C.P.C. can be invoked to challenge the judgment and decree passed by a Family Court under the Family Courts Act, 1964?Whether the High Court in the exercise of its constitutional writ jurisdiction rightly declined to not interfere in the concurrent findings of facts recorded by the courts below?Whether the recall of the decree of dissolution of marriage on the ground of khula was in violation of Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, read with Section 21 of the Family Courts Act, 1964?----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, upholding the decisions of the lower courts. It ruled that:Section 12(2) of C.P.C. is applicable in proceedings before Family Courts as per established jurisprudence allowing the general principles of C.P.C. to be applied.The High Court properly exercised its jurisdiction by not interfering with the concurrent factual findings of the lower courts, as such findings were based on substantial evidence indicating misrepresentation in the recall application.Addressing the recall of the decree under Section 7 of the Ordinance, in conjunction with Section 21 of the Act, was deemed unnecessary as the case was decided on the misrepresentation found in the recall application, making further discussion academic.-----Citations/Precedents:Syed Ali Nawaz Gardezi v.

The appeal challenged the acquittal of Ghulam Rasool and Ghulam Haider, sons of Imam Din, by the Lahore High Court. The case stemmed from an incident where the petitioner's husband, Muhammad Ishaq, was allegedly murdered by the respondents due to a previous family dispute involving the murder of Hakim Ali, the elder brother of Ghulam Rasool.Issues:Whether the Lahore High Court erred in acquitting Ghulam Rasool and Ghulam Haider, despite the conviction by the trial court.Whether the prosecution's evidence was sufficient to prove the guilt of the respondents beyond a reasonable doubt.-----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court of Pakistan, composed of Mr. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Mrs. Justice Ayesha A. Malik, and Mr. Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, reviewed the case. The court noted discrepancies in the witnesses' testimonies and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, as highlighted by the Lahore High Court. These included discrepancies in the timing of the incident, improvements in witness statements during the trial, and lack of corroborative evidence.The court cited legal precedents emphasizing the importance of extending the benefit of doubt to the accused when uncertainties exist in the prosecution's case. It stressed that even a single doubt in the prosecution's story should favor the accused. Given the doubts raised by the High Court and the principles of criminal jurisprudence, the Supreme Court concluded that the acquittal by the Lahore High Court did not warrant interference.As a result, the Supreme Court refused Leave to Appeal, affirming the Lahore High Court's judgment and dismissing the Criminal Petition No. 412-L/2014.-----Citations/Precedents:Muhammad Riaz v Khurram Shehzad (2024 SCMR 51)Tariq Parvez v The State (1995 SCMR 1345)Muhammad Akram v The Sate (2009 SCMR 230)Muhammad Imran v The State (2020 SCMR 857)Mst.

The Family Judge initially granted custody to the mother, but the Peshawar High Court set aside this decision, relying on an agreement between the parties wherein Beena relinquished custody rights. Beena appealed to the Supreme Court against this decision.---Issues:Whether an agreement relinquishing custody rights as part of a khula (dissolution of marriage) is legally valid.Whether a mother's physical disability can be a ground for denying custody.Whether the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in custody disputes.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court held that agreements surrendering custody rights as part of khula are void as they contravene Islamic principles of custody and public policy.The Court emphasized that a mother's physical disability cannot automatically disqualify her from custody, as the law prioritizes the best interest of the child.Relying on constitutional principles and Islamic teachings, the Court reaffirmed the importance of a mother's role in a child's upbringing and condemned derogatory language against disabled individuals.The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's decision, ordering the respondent to hand over custody of Muhammad Rayyan to the petitioner within seven days.---Citations/Precedents:Razia Rehman v.

The petitioner was tried for a murderous assault on his estranged wife, Mst. Sabiha, and brother-in-law, Abdul Majeed, in the District Court premises on 8th February 2013. The incident allegedly occurred after proceedings before a Family Judge, where the petitioner confronted them in the parking lot and attempted to fire shots. He was subdued and disarmed by witnesses with the assistance of a police official on duty.---Issues:Whether the conviction of the petitioner was based on sufficient evidence?Whether the inclusion of the petitioner's brother in the array for being in the community of intention was justified?Whether the seizure of the pistol and bullets presented by the complainant qualified as corroboration of the prosecution's case?---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court found the complainant's narrative to be based solely on word of mouth, with inherent missing links and inconsistencies. The investigating officer did not secure missed bullets from the crime scene nor associate the police official who allegedly intervened to disarm the petitioner. The inclusion of the petitioner's brother in the array was deemed oblique and suspect. Additionally, the seizure of the pistol and bullets did not qualify as corroboration under Article 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Given the persisting animosity and the flawed nature of the prosecution's case, the petition was converted into an appeal, and the petitioner was acquitted of the charge.",

The petitions arose from separate FIRs (Nos. 691/2022 and 693/2022) registered at Police Station Badber, District Peshawar, under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (P.P.C.), including 452, 427, 354, 506, 148, and 149, among others.??Issues:Whether the offenses listed in the FIRs fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.), which would generally restrict the granting of bail.Whether there is potential enmity that might have led to the wrongful implication of Faheem Ullah in the alleged crimes due to familial disputes related to another criminal case.?Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court observed that the offenses mentioned in both FIRs do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C., which means that bail cannot be automatically denied based solely on the nature of the offenses. The Court also considered potential motives for the petitioner?s implication arising from family disputes and previous criminal proceedings involving relatives. Notably, the petitioner?s mother is an eyewitness in a related murder case, suggesting possible motives for retaliation or wrongful implication.Both petitions were converted into appeals and allowed.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:The petitioner, Khalid Pervaiz, married respondent No.1, Samina, on February 10, 2017, with a mehr (dower) of five hundred thousand rupees mentioned in the Nikahnama. However, the petitioner failed to pay the mehr, leading respondent No.1 to file a suit on January 8, 2018. The Family Court ruled in her favor on February 23, 2019, directing the petitioner to pay the mehr and maintenance. The petitioner appealed, but the High Court restored the Family Court's judgment. The petitioner, still married to respondent No.1, has not paid the mehr, citing the pendency of the petition.---Issues:Whether the petitioner is obligated to pay the mehr despite the marriage subsisting.Whether the High Court's decision regarding the payment of mehr is lawful.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Court affirmed that mehr is an Islamic concept recognized by Pakistani law. The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962, and the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, mandate the payment of mehr on demand by the wife. The Supreme Court precedent in Syed Muhammad v Mst. Zeenat (PLD 2001 SC 128) established that mehr can be demanded during the marriage, and the husband is obliged to pay it. The petitioner's failure to pay the mehr despite demand led to unnecessary litigation, burdening the judicial system. The petitioner's defense was untenable, and the High Court's decision aligns with the law. Leave to appeal was declined, and the petition was dismissed. The Court imposed costs and compensatory costs of one hundred thousand rupees on the petitioner, to be paid along with the mehr within one month. Failure to comply would lead to the Family Court executing the order, possibly by attaching the petitioner's properties.---Citations/Precedents:Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1962Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961Syed Muhammad v Mst.

Discrepancies emerged in the prosecution's case, particularly regarding the injuries sustained by the petitioner and his family members, which contradicted the narrative presented in the crime report.The court found it suspicious that the deceased did not provide a statement to the police despite being conscious and stable.

The court dismissed the argument that Muhammad Ashraf was innocently caught in the brawl, noting that the witnesses' testimonies were corroborated by medical evidence.The court also addressed the defense's attempt to discredit the witnesses' testimonies by selectively quoting a statement from one witness. It clarified that the quoted statement, when read in context, did not support the defense's argument of Muhammad Ashraf's absence during the incident.Furthermore, the court considered the recovery of a weapon, consistent with the injuries sustained by the victims, as evidence supporting Muhammad Ashraf's culpability.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Petitioner, challenging an order from the Lahore High Court which had dismissed his writ petition. The original dispute stems from a maintenance allowance suit filed by Mst. Sobia Amir Farid (respondent No.1 and the petitioner's wife) for herself and their minor children. The Family Court had initially ordered Shahzad to pay interim maintenance under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. Shahzad's failure to comply with this order led to the striking off of his defense and a decree in favor of Mst. Sobia based on the plaint's averments and the evidence.---Issues:Whether the Family Court acted within its rights under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964, to strike off the petitioner's defense and decree maintenance due to his non-payment.Whether there was any procedural or substantial illegality in the High Court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's appeal against the Family Court's ruling.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court dismissed the petition, finding no illegality, impropriety, or irrationality in the decisions of the lower courts. The Family Court was deemed correct in its decision to strike off the defense and decree maintenance due to Shahzad's repeated failure to comply with the interim maintenance order. The High Court's refusal to interfere with the Family Court's findings was also upheld. The Supreme Court noted the petitioner's conduct as an abuse of the judicial process, characterizing his actions as vexatious litigation that burdened the courts unnecessarily. As a result, the Court imposed a penalty of Rs. 1,00,000 against Shahzad to deter similar behavior in the future.---Citations/Precedents:Section 17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 - Allows the court to enforce interim maintenance orders and take punitive measures for non-compliance.",

Consequently, all proceedings against Justice Isa in the SJC, including a show-cause notice, were abated.The court ordered the Inland Revenue to individually reassess the legality of the assets held by Justice Isa's family in the UK, setting specific deadlines and procedures for this reassessment, separate from the judicial review process.It underscored the constitutional protection of judicial independence and the right of judges and other citizens to be treated according to the law, emphasizing that no individual or institution is above the law, including judges.Justice Yahya Afridi dissented in part, finding Constitutional Petition No. 17/2019 non-maintainable.---Citations/PrecedentsArticle 209 of the Constitution, regarding the procedure for the SJC.Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, under which the assets in question are to be reassessed.Various constitutional principles concerning the independence of the judiciary and the legal protections afforded to judges and citizens.",

The incident occurred on 8th July 2010, within the precincts of Police Station Chatiana District Toba Tek Singh, Pakistan. Imran was convicted under clause (b) of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, and sentenced to death on three counts by the Sessions Judge Toba Tek Singh on 8th March 2011. This judgment was upheld by the High Court on 29th September 2015. Imran now appeals against the High Court's decision.---Issues:Whether the witnesses' testimony is credible and sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Whether the motive asserted by the prosecution is plausible.Whether the sentence of death is appropriate given the circumstances of the case.---Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The prosecution's case primarily relied on the eyewitness accounts of Abdul Sattar (PW-6) and Abdul Ghaffar (PW-7), who were close relatives of the deceased. Their testimonies detailed the events leading up to the murders and implicated Imran as the perpetrator. The court found their accounts to be credible and consistent, dismissing Imran's argument that their presence at the crime scene was improbable.The motive presented by the prosecution, relating to Imran's troubled marital relationship and his violent response to his wife seeking help from her family, was deemed plausible by the court. Imran's disproportionate reaction and the brutality inflicted on his wife and daughters supported the prosecution's narrative.Additional evidence, such as the recovery of a bloodstained weapon (Toka) consistent with the injuries suffered by the victims, further corroborated the prosecution's case. The investigating officer (Ghulam Qadir, SI) provided testimony that contradicted Imran's defense.Considering the overwhelming evidence against Imran and the heinous nature of the crime, the court upheld the death sentence imposed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court. Imran's appeal was disallowed.",

The Court found:The appellate court was justified in admitting the death certificate of Mst. Malookan Bibi as additional evidence under Order XLI, Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code, as it was necessary to clarify the factual dispute regarding the date of her death.The compromise deed executed in 1969 was not given due consideration because it was marked but not exhibited in evidence, and the appellate and High Courts were correct in their treatment of this document.The judgments of the lower courts were based on a proper assessment of the evidence, including the legally admitted death certificate which was decisive in determining the heirs entitled to the estate.----Citations/Precedents:Order XLI, Rule 27, Civil Procedure Code ?

The petition challenges the decree that required the petitioners, who are the paternal uncles of the respondent's child, to pay maintenance following the death of the child's father, Muhammad Farooq Ahmad, and grandfather, Muhammad Bashir.---Issues:The primary issue was whether paternal uncles are responsible for providing maintenance to their niece, especially when the child?s father and grandfather are deceased, and the uncles are benefiting from inherited property.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court dismissed the petition, holding that the paternal uncles are responsible for the maintenance of their niece. The reasoning was based on interpretations of Islamic law and previous court decisions, emphasizing that relatives benefiting from an inherited estate have obligations towards other heirs, particularly minors. The court found that the maintenance should be provided from the estate until the minor?s share is duly handed over.----Citations/Precedents:TAHIR MAHMOOD vs. ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, BUREWALA and others (PLJ 2024 Lahore (Note) 19)Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants filed an appeal against the judgment of the Additional District Judge/Judge Family Court, Muzaffarabad, dated 04.08.2022. The judgment dismissed their application for adjustment of gold ornaments in the execution of a decree for dower and maintenance allowance filed by the respondent, Mst. Asima Bashir Abbasi. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court erred in dismissing the application for adjustment of gold ornaments in the execution of the decree. 2- Whether the executing court is bound to adhere strictly to the contents of the decree. 3- Whether the judgment and decree regarding the dower and maintenance allowance are final and executable as decreed. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Application for Adjustment of Gold Ornaments: The appellants argued that the trial court should have considered the gold ornaments allegedly taken by the respondent as part of the dower payment. However, the court found that the trial court had only observed that the respondent had taken gold and deposited it in the bank as a surety against a loan. There was no conclusive finding that this gold should be treated as part of the dower payment. --Executing Court's Boundaries: The court reiterated the settled principle that an executing court is bound to execute a final decree in its letter and spirit and cannot deviate from its terms. The executing court correctly followed this principle by dismissing the appellants' application for adjustment of the gold ornaments, as the decree specified the payment of Rs. 5,00,000/- in cash or kind (rooms, bathroom, kitchen), without any mention of the gold ornaments. --Finality of Judgment and Decree: The court noted that the judgment and decree had been appealed and upheld by both this Court and the Supreme Court, thus attaining finality. The executing court was right in observing that any grievance regarding the gold ornaments should be addressed through a separate legal action rather than through the execution proceedings. The court concluded that the appeal lacked merit and was dismissed with no order as to costs. The judgment of the trial court was upheld, and the execution of the decree was to proceed as originally decreed. ----Citations/Precedents: PLD 2003 Supreme Court (AJ&K) 14 PLD 2011 Lahore 450",

The petitioner sought to set aside this order and to direct the Family Court to accept his application and record the remaining evidence of witnesses regarding the correct date of birth of the minor. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court erred in dismissing the petitioner\u2019s application regarding the minor's date of birth. 2- Whether the writ petition is maintainable given the existence of another adequate legal remedy. 3- Whether the Family Court has the jurisdiction to correct entries in birth certificates. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Family Court's Dismissal of Application: The Family Court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s application, favoring the respondent\u2019s evidence, which included a NADRA-issued \"Form B\" showing the minor's date of birth as 04.04.2009. The petitioner presented a birth certificate issued by the Municipal Corporation Kotli on 22.07.2006, stating the minor's date of birth as 09.06.2006. The court found the NADRA record to have a presumption of truth unless proven otherwise. --Maintainability of Writ Petition: The court highlighted that writ jurisdiction under Article 44 is not akin to a civil suit and should be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances where no other adequate remedy is available. The petitioner has the option to approach the Civil Court for a declaratory judgment regarding the correct date of birth, making the writ petition unnecessary. --Jurisdiction of Family Court: The court confirmed that the Family Court does not have the authority to correct entries in birth certificates. This responsibility lies within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court, which can adjudicate on disputed questions of fact requiring evidence. The court dismissed the writ petition, affirming that the Family Court's order was just and correct.

The plot, located in Mangla Hamlet Phase II, Mirpur, had been allotted on 15.09.2008. The petitioners claimed that the cancellation was illegal and sought the restoration of the allotment. The respondents argued that the plot had been canceled following due procedure and subsequently re-allotted. ----Issues: 1- Whether the cancellation of the allotment of plot No. 269 was lawful. 2- Whether the re-allotment of the plot to respondent No. 7 was valid. 3- Whether the simultaneous allotment of two plots to one family was fair and transparent. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court found that the cancellation of the plot was based on a decision by the MDA Board dated 04.03.2006, which was not included as a respondent. The court held that without the necessary party, the order could not be effectively challenged. The court noted the arbitrary practice of the MDA in passing wholesale allotment orders without adherence to relevant laws. The allotment of two plots to one family was deemed arbitrary and a colorable exercise of power. The court held that the dual allotment was not sustainable and directed the petitioners to file an application against the allotment of plot No. 270 to the husband of respondent No. 7.

The Court below properly assessed the evidence and applied the law correctly in decreeing the maintenance allowance in favor of the respondent. ---Provision of Maintenance: The appellant failed to provide sufficient evidence to refute the claims of non-payment of maintenance allowance. The Court found that the appellant, despite having the financial capacity, did not provide maintenance to his wife and daughter. ---Justifiability of Maintenance Allowance: The maintenance allowance decreed by the Court below, Rs.7,000 per head per month along with a 10% annual increment, was found to be reasonable and justifiable. The Court emphasized that the demand for maintenance by the wife was legitimate, especially given the circumstances of desertion and inhuman treatment.

The appellant had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, while the respondent, Syeda Muneeba Gillani, had filed suits for dower and maintenance allowance. ----Issues: 1- Whether the respondent was entitled to maintenance allowance despite leaving the appellant's house. 2- Whether the dower amount was outstanding and should be paid by the appellant. 3- Whether the trial court's decree for restitution of conjugal rights in favor of the appellant was justifiable. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Maintenance Allowance: The court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to grant maintenance allowance to the respondent. It was determined that the respondent had left the appellant\u2019s house due to mental and physical cruelty, making her entitled to maintenance. --Dower: The court confirmed that the dower amount of PKR 100,000 was outstanding and should be paid by the appellant. The contents of the \"Nikahnama\" indicated the dower as deferred, and the appellant\u2019s witness admitted that the dower was unpaid. --Restitution of Conjugal Rights: The court set aside the trial court\u2019s decree for restitution of conjugal rights in favor of the appellant. The evidence showed that the respondent had suffered mental torture and cruel treatment, making it unreasonable to compel her to return to the marital home. The court upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to grant maintenance allowance and the outstanding dower to the respondent.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, while the respondent filed four suits seeking dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty, dower, maintenance, and recovery of dowry articles. The Family Court consolidated the suits and decreed the dissolution of marriage on the basis of khula, awarding maintenance from April 22, 2021, to the period of iddat, and dismissed other suits, including the appellant's suit for restitution of conjugal rights. The appellant appealed against the dissolution of marriage and the maintenance allowance decree. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court erred in dissolving the marriage on the basis of khula. 2- Whether the Family Court correctly awarded maintenance allowance from April 22, 2021, to the period of iddat. -----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Dissolution of Marriage (Khula): The court upheld the dissolution of marriage on the basis of khula, referencing Verse No. 229 of Surah Baqarah from the Holy Quran, which allows a wife to seek divorce by returning consideration to the husband if they cannot keep within the limits of God. The court emphasized that a judge can order khula even without the husband's agreement, based on precedents from the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), where khula was enforced upon the wife's request for separation due to incompatibility or extreme dislike. The evidence presented showed sufficient grounds for mental cruelty and an irreparable breakdown of the marital relationship, justifying the khula decree. --Maintenance Allowance: The court upheld the award of maintenance from April 22, 2021, to the period of iddat, citing the husband's failure to provide maintenance and evidence of mental cruelty and neglect. The court reasoned that the husband's duty to maintain his wife continues unless there is clear evidence of disobedience or wrongful abandonment, which was not substantiated by the appellant. The appeal challenging the dissolution of marriage was dismissed, and the award of maintenance allowance was upheld. -----Citations/Precedents: Verse No. 229 of Surah Baqarah, Holy Quran Instances of khula enforced by the Holy Prophet (PBUH) Abid Hussain v.

The petitioner also requested medical facilities and a thorough checkup for the convict, claiming that the convict did not recognize family members due to a serious ailment. ----Issues: 1- Whether the death warrant for the execution of the convict should be set aside. 2- Whether the convict is mentally fit for execution. 3- Whether Rules 443, 444, and 445 of the Prison Rules, 1978, were violated. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Death Warrant and Mental Health: The court found that the convict was not mentally ill, based on the medical examination conducted by a Medical Specialist and a Psychiatrist. The convict was suffering from Hyperventilation (ABP) due to the stress of his impending execution, but he was not found to be mentally unfit. The court noted that the petitioner had withdrawn the application for the convict's medical treatment before the Jail Superintendent, making it impossible for the Superintendent to act on it. --Prison Rules Compliance: The court examined Rules 443, 444, and 445 of the Prison Rules, 1978, which deal with the treatment of convicted prisoners of unsound mind. Since the convict was not found to be mentally ill, these rules were not applicable. --Extraordinary Jurisdiction: The court emphasized that extraordinary jurisdiction is only exercised in cases where there is a violation of law. The petitioner failed to demonstrate any violation or departure from the law in this case. The writ petition was dismissed in limine, meaning it was dismissed without requiring a detailed response from the respondents because it lacked merit. -----Citations/Precedents: Relevant Statutes and Rules: Article 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution, 1974 Sections 302/341, APC and 13/20/65, AA Rules 443, 444, and 445 of the Prison Rules, 1978 \"Tayyab Abbasi Vs.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case concerns a murder that occurred on June 23, 2009. The prosecution alleged that the accused, along with several accomplices, ambushed and killed the victim due to personal animosity rooted in a family dispute. The trial court convicted the primary accused of murder, sentencing them to death as 'Qisas' under Section 302(a) of the Azad Penal Code (APC). Another accused was sentenced to one year of imprisonment under Section 147 of the APC. Both the conviction and sentence were appealed by the convicts, while the complainant filed a counter-appeal seeking an enhancement of the sentence. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction and death sentence under 'Qisas' were justified based on the evidence presented. 2- Whether the sentence imposed on the second accused was appropriate or should be enhanced. 3- Whether legal procedures, including the acceptance of statements and the handling of evidence, were properly followed. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Conviction and Death Sentence Justified: The court upheld the conviction and death sentence of the primary accused. The prosecution's case was supported by consistent and corroborative eyewitness testimonies, as well as medical and forensic evidence. The court found that the evidence established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Sentence for Second Accused: The court dismissed the appeal for enhancing the sentence of the second accused, maintaining the sentence as awarded by the trial court. The evidence did not warrant an increase in the sentence. Procedural Validity: The court rejected the argument that legal procedures were not properly followed. It noted that the statement of a legal heir, who initially forgave the primary accused, was later retracted under allegations of coercion. The court chose to decide the case based on the merits and disregarded the retracted statement. ----Citations/Precedents: 2006 SCR 365: Addressed the reliability of testimony from witnesses who are close relatives of the victim.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellants filed a civil appeal challenging the judgment and decree passed by the Additional District Judge Sehnsa on May 29, 2012, which had reversed the decision of the Civil Judge Sehnsa from April 30, 2009. The respondents had initially filed a suit for declaration, claiming ownership of ancestral land in Thalyara, Tehsil Sehnsa, District Kotli, and sought the cancellation of mutations No. 71 and 82, which they alleged were fraudulent. The trial court dismissed the suits, but the appellate court reversed this decision, leading to the current appeal by the appellants. ----Issues: 1- Whether mutation No. 71, related to the inheritance of Lal Khan\u2019s property, was justified and legally valid. 2- Whether the suits filed by the respondents were barred by limitation. 3- Whether the family of Lal Khan was governed by custom or by Muslim personal law regarding inheritance. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of the Additional District Judge Sehnsa. The court reasoned that: Mutation No. 71: The mutation was found to be unjustified and fraudulent. The appellants claimed that the mutation was made according to custom, but they failed to provide satisfactory evidence to prove that the family of Lal Khan followed any custom that derogated from Muslim personal law. The court presumed that, being Muslims, the family of Lal Khan was governed by Islamic law, under which the daughters and widow of Lal Khan were rightful inheritors. Limitation: The court held that the suits were not barred by limitation, as the matter involved inheritance rights. It is a well-established principle that no limitation runs against a party for claiming their inheritance rights. Custom vs. Muslim Law: The court emphasized that custom must be proved by solid and reliable evidence, and there is no presumption in favor of custom over personal law. Since the appellants could not prove the existence of a valid custom that would override the Muslim law of inheritance, the court applied Muslim personal law, declaring the mutation fraudulent. The court concluded that the Additional District Judge Sehnsa had correctly assessed the evidence and legal principles, and the appeal had no merit. ----Citations/Precedents: 1998 SCR 333 1985 CLC 217 2000 SCR 328 2002 CLC 1539 2006 MLD 1422 Ishaq\u2019s case, PLD 1983 SC 273 Ms. Shela Zia & others V.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 44 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution, 1974, challenging an order passed by the Justice of Peace/District and Session Judge, Muzaffarabad, on January 14, 2021. The petitioner sought the quashing of an FIR that was registered based on this order, alleging that the order was issued without proper judicial consideration and was intended to harass the petitioner and his family. ----Issues: 1- Whether the order passed by the Justice of Peace directing the registration of a second FIR related to the same incident is legally valid. 2- Whether the second FIR is permissible under the law, given that it pertains to the same occurrence as the first FIR. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir dismissed the writ petition, upholding the order passed by the Justice of Peace. The court reasoned as follows: Permissibility of Second FIR: The court held that the registration of a second FIR is permissible under the law, particularly when it involves a different version of the same occurrence. The court referred to various precedents, including decisions from the Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which establish that a second FIR can be registered if it presents a counter-version of the incident that differs from the first FIR. The court noted that criminal law does not place any restriction on filing a second FIR, especially when the information provided in the second FIR portrays a different angle of the incident. Judicial Consideration and Due Process: The court found that the Justice of Peace had acted within his legal authority by directing the police to register the second FIR. The court rejected the petitioner's argument that the order was issued without due judicial consideration, noting that the petitioner has multiple legal remedies available to challenge the FIR and any subsequent investigation. Stare Decisis: The court emphasized the importance of adhering to established legal precedents, including the principle of stare decisis, which requires lower courts to follow the legal principles established by higher courts. The court cited several precedents supporting the registration of multiple FIRs in cases where different versions of the same incident are presented. The court concluded that there was no legal basis to interfere with the order of the Justice of Peace, as it was in accordance with the law. The petition was therefore dismissed. ----Citations/Precedents: Ch. Muhammad Younas Arvi and 2 others Vs. Abdul Aziz and 04 others, 2011 SCR 50 Kh. Muhammad Naeem Vs.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case arose from a long-standing land dispute that escalated into violence. The accused, along with his co-accused, attacked the complainant's family, resulting in the death of one individual and injuries to another. The trial court convicted the main accused under Section 302(B) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and other relevant sections, sentencing him to death, among other penalties. The convict appealed the decision, while the state sought confirmation of the death sentence. The convict had absconded after the trial court's judgment and filed an appeal after a significant delay. ----Issues: 1- Validity of the Trial Court's Judgment: Whether the trial court's judgment convicting the appellant was legally justified. 2- Delay in Filing Appeal: Whether the delay in filing the appeal by the convict affects its validity. 3- Conduct of the Convict: Whether the convict\u2019s absconding behavior and subsequent criminal activities impact the appeal. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Validity of the Trial Court's Judgment: The High Court upheld the trial court's judgment, finding that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence provided by the eyewitnesses was consistent, and medical reports corroborated the prosecution's account. The court found no irregularities in the trial court's decision. Delay in Filing Appeal: The appeal was filed after a delay of over nine years. However, the court chose to address the merits of the case rather than dismiss the appeal solely on the grounds of delay, given the severity of the death penalty involved. Conduct of the Convict: The court noted the convict's deliberate absconding and involvement in other criminal activities. This conduct was found to be relevant and indicative of a criminal mindset, which further justified the upholding of the trial court's decision. ----Citations/Precedents: 2000 S.C.R. 123: Addressed the principle that a court can rely on prosecution witnesses' statements against some accused while rejecting them against others. 2001 S.C.R. 240: Reinforced the principle that a criminal court must sift the truth from falsehood, allowing reliance on certain aspects of witness testimony while discarding others.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Acquittal granted----Background: The case involves two criminal appeals stemming from a single judgment passed by the Additional District Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Mirpur, on April 24, 2017. The case revolved around a night-time robbery and murder where masked assailants entered the complainant's home, leading to the death of the complainant's wife and injuries to other family members. Following the investigation, several individuals were arrested, charged, and subsequently convicted by the trial court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction and sentencing of the appellants by the trial court were justified based on the evidence presented. 2- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting one of the accused, Nazir Mehdi, and in convicting the appellant Muhammad Zaroob based on allegations of abetment. 3- Whether the sentences handed down by the trial court should be enhanced given the severity of the crime. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Conviction and Sentencing of Appellants: The trial court's decision to convict the appellants\u2014Jamil, Sabir, Faisal, and Ilyas\u2014was based on solid evidence, including identification through an identification parade and witness testimony. The court found that the involvement of these individuals in the crime was established beyond reasonable doubt, and their convictions under sections 392 and 302 of the PPC were upheld. The appeals by the complainant seeking enhancement of the sentences were dismissed, as the court determined that the evidence did not warrant harsher penalties. Acquittal of Nazir Mehdi and Conviction of Muhammad Zaroob: The court upheld the acquittal of Nazir Mehdi, noting that the evidence against him was insufficient to establish his involvement in the crime. Regarding Muhammad Zaroob, the court found that the trial court's conviction under section 109 of the PPC for abetment was not supported by the evidence. The alleged recovery of gloves and a rifle from Zaroob's residence did not conclusively link him to the crime, as the prosecution failed to prove that these items were used during the commission of the offense. Consequently, Zaroob's appeal was accepted, and his conviction was overturned. Request for Sentence Enhancement: The court dismissed the complainant's appeal for sentence enhancement, reasoning that while the crime was severe, the evidence did not support a more stringent punishment. The possibility of mistaken identification and the nature of the evidence presented led the court to conclude that the trial court's sentencing was appropriate. The appeal of Muhammad Zaroob was accepted, and his conviction was overturned, leading to his acquittal. The convictions and sentences of the other accused persons were upheld. The appeal seeking enhancement of the sentences was dismissed.",

The case revolves around the murder of Zahoor Ahmed, who was allegedly killed by a group of men due to a personal grudge. The appellants in the case are Ghaffar Hussain and others, who were convicted of various charges, including murder, while the complainants, including the deceased's family members, sought a review of the judgment to enhance the punishment and convict additional accused. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction and sentencing of the appellants by the trial court were justified based on the evidence presented. 2- Whether the trial court erred in acquitting some of the accused and in determining the extent of the punishment for those convicted. 3- Whether the death sentence awarded to Ghaffar Hussain as Qisas should be confirmed. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: Conviction and Sentencing: The court upheld the trial court's conviction of Ghaffar Hussain for the murder of Zahoor Ahmed, sentencing him to death as Qisas, along with additional penalties for other offenses. The court found that the evidence, including eyewitness testimony, forensic reports, and the recovery of the murder weapon, supported the conviction. The court also upheld the convictions of Imran Hussain and Abrar Hussain for their roles in the crime, including the illegal possession of firearms. Acquittal and Lesser Sentences: The court examined the evidence against the other accused who were acquitted by the trial court. The court found that the trial court had correctly assessed the lack of evidence against these individuals, particularly with regard to their involvement in the murder. The court noted that the evidence did not establish a common intent among all the accused to commit the murder, which is necessary to apply the doctrine of vicarious liability under Section 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). As a result, the acquittal of these accused was upheld. Confirmation of Death Sentence: The court affirmed the death sentence awarded to Ghaffar Hussain under the principle of Qisas, finding that the evidence clearly established his guilt as the principal offender in the murder of Zahoor Ahmed. The court found no mitigating circumstances that would warrant a reduction in the sentence. The appeals filed by Ghaffar Hussain and others (Criminal Appeal No. 70/2017) were dismissed, and their convictions and sentences were upheld. The appeal filed by the complainants (Criminal Appeal No. 72/2017) seeking enhanced punishment and the conviction of additional accused was also dismissed. The death sentence awarded to Ghaffar Hussain was confirmed. ----Citations/Precedents: The judgment was primarily based on the evaluation of the evidence presented during the trial, including eyewitness testimony, forensic reports, and legal principles governing the application of Qisas and vicarious liability under the PPC. The court relied on established legal doctrines regarding the conviction of individuals in cases involving unlawful assemblies and the application of Section 149 of the PPC.",

The respondents had filed two separate suits\u2014one for the dissolution of marriage and the other for the recovery of maintenance allowance. The respondent-wife claimed that the appellant-husband went abroad shortly after their marriage, did not provide maintenance for her and their minor daughter, and had not contacted her since March 2015. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Family Court correctly decreed the dissolution of marriage based on non-payment of maintenance and failure to perform marital obligations. 2- Whether the maintenance allowance awarded to the respondent-wife and minor daughter was justified. 3- Whether the father of the appellant (grandfather of the minor) was wrongly held responsible for the maintenance payments. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The High Court upheld the judgment of the Family Court, affirming the dissolution of marriage and the award of maintenance. The court reasoned that the appellant-husband\u2019s failure to maintain contact with his wife and minor daughter since 2015, coupled with his failure to provide maintenance, justified the dissolution of marriage under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. The court also found that the amount of Rs. 8000 per month for maintenance was reasonable given the appellant\u2019s residence abroad, where earnings are typically higher. The court clarified that the father of the appellant (grandfather) was not held responsible for maintenance, dismissing the appellants' argument as misconceived. ----Citations/Precedents: 2011 SCR 224 - Evasive denial in written statements can be deemed as admission. 1996 SCR 82 - General principles of Qanoon-e-Shahadat and C.P.C apply in Family Court proceedings. 2020 SCR 378 - Failure to maintain contact and perform marital obligations amounts to cruelty. 2001 CLC Kar. 507 - No right of appeal exists in cases of dissolution of marriage under Section 14(2) of the Family Court Act.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:This case involves a constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, presented by Syed Zain Muntazar Mehdi (Petitioner) against Mst. Sara Naqvi and others (Respondents). The petition challenges the judgments of the lower courts, which upheld the family court's decision granting the respondent recovery of maintenance, dowry articles, and delivery expenses. The petitioner contends that the decisions of the lower courts suffer from misreading and non-reading of material evidence, particularly ignoring his financial incapacity to meet the maintenance demands set by the courts.----Issues:Whether the maintenance awarded to the respondent and their children was excessive considering the petitioner's financial status.Whether the judgments by the lower courts were valid for consideration under a constitutional petition.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Lahore High Court dismissed the constitutional petition, affirming the decisions of the lower courts. The court found that:The petitioner's arguments regarding his financial status and the excessive nature of the maintenance were insufficient to overturn the findings of the lower courts.The evidence provided by the petitioner, including his salary slip, was deemed inadequate to challenge the established maintenance claims effectively.The court emphasized that findings of fact by a competent court exercising lawful jurisdiction cannot be revisited in writ jurisdiction unless there is a legal infirmity or a jurisdictional error causing a serious miscarriage of justice, which was not evident in this case.-----Citations/Precedents:Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 - Allows for constitutional petitions but limits interference with factual findings of lower courts unless exceptional circumstances exist.Supreme Court decisions on maintenance obligations underline that such obligations are not only legal but also moral and religious, and must be fulfilled unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.",

Shazia Hassan. Shazia Hassan filed three suits against Hameed for recovery of dower, maintenance allowance, and dowry articles following their marriage, which ended with her alleged desertion. Hameed contested these claims and filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, claiming his wife had left without justification.----Issues:Whether the Family Court properly assessed the evidence in awarding dower, maintenance allowance, and dowry articles to the respondent.Whether the respondent was entitled to maintenance allowance despite allegedly leaving the appellant's home without justification.Whether the Shariat Appellate Bench correctly upheld the Family Court's decision without a detailed discussion of the evidence.----Holding/Reasoning/OutcomeThe Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir dismissed the appeal, affirming the decisions of the Family Court and the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court.The Family Court's decision was based on substantial evidence indicating that the appellant failed to pay the deferred dower and maintenance allowance as agreed. Witnesses corroborated the respondent's claims of mistreatment and unjustified desertion. The court also noted that the appellant did not seriously attempt to reconcile with his wife.The Shariat Appellate Bench, though not detailed in its judgment, applied judicial mind and reviewed the evidence sufficiently. The Supreme Court found no misreading or non-reading of evidence by the lower courts. The Supreme Court upheld the award of Rs. 400,000 as dower, Rs. 3,000 per month as maintenance allowance from the date of desertion, and the recovery of dowry articles or their monetary equivalent.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:The appellant, Shahzad Rauf, filed a civil appeal against the judgment of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court dated 05.04.2018. The respondent, Mst. Shabana Yaseen, had filed four suits in the Senior Civil Judge/Judge Family Court, Rawalakot on 22.11.2012 for:Dissolution of marriageRecovery of maintenance allowance at Rs. 15,000 per monthRecovery of dower amounting to Rs. 600,000Recovery of dowry articles or an alternative amount of Rs. 89,135Shahzad Rauf also filed a counter-suit for the restitution of conjugal rights. The Family Court decreed in favor of the respondent, dissolving the marriage, and granted the requested financial amounts. The appellant filed an appeal against the decree, but the High Court dismissed it, leading to this appeal.----Issues:Whether the order passed by the Family Court fixing monthly installments for the payment of decretal amounts is a final order or an interlocutory order.Whether the Family Court's fixation of installments is beyond the appellant?s capacity to pay and requires re-evaluation.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:Interlocutory vs. Final Order: The Supreme Court concluded that the Family Court's decision on the execution applications was final and not an interlocutory order. It was determined that the Family Court?s order conclusively resolved the matter of the payment schedule, making it a final decision appealable under section 14 of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Family Courts Act, 1993.Installments and Financial Capacity: The Court emphasized the need for the Family Court to reassess the financial capacity of the appellant. The current fixed installment of Rs. 50,000 per month was found to be potentially excessive given the appellant's alleged monthly income of Rs. 10,000. The Supreme Court directed the Family Court to gather more evidence on the appellant's financial situation and determine reasonable installments for the payment of the decretal amounts.The Supreme Court remanded the case to the Family Court for reassessment of the installment amounts, while temporarily setting a reduced installment of Rs. 10,000 per month for the decretal amount, in addition to the Rs. 3,000 per month maintenance allowance.----Citations/Precedents:Noreen Akhtar vs. Liaquat Hussain [2004 SCR 143]Muhammad Ramzan vs. Rukhshana Kausar and another [2006 SCR 104]Ali Haider and others vs. Syed Muhammad Ashgar Shah [2014 SCR 1004]Muhammad Zaheer-ud-Din Babar vs. Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background:Khadam Hussain, the appellant, challenged the dismissal of his writ petition by the High Court. He sought directions for the de-award of his land acquired for the construction of the Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences. Hussain argued that his land, which included his residence and a family graveyard, had not been utilized as planned and should be returned to him. Despite approval from the Prime Minister and other authorities for the de-award, the respondents did not act accordingly. The High Court dismissed his petition without a detailed hearing, prompting the appeal to the Supreme Court.----Issues:Whether the High Court erred in dismissing the writ petition in limine without addressing all the grievances raised by the appellant.Whether the appellant is entitled to the de-award of his land based on the approval from the Prime Minister and similar de-awards granted to other landowners.Whether there was discrimination against the appellant in the treatment of his de-award request compared to other landowners.-----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir held that the High Court erred in dismissing the writ petition in limine without addressing the appellant's primary grievances regarding the de-award of the land. The Supreme Court noted that the appellant's claim of discrimination and his argument that similar de-awards were granted to other landowners were not properly considered. The Supreme Court found that the High Court only considered the transfer of land to the Medical College and did not address the main issue of de-awarding the land. The report from the Deputy Commissioner indicated that the appellant had constructed residential structures on the land, necessitating a detailed hearing to resolve these issues.The Supreme Court admitted the writ petition for regular hearing to address the de-award claim and remanded the case to the High Court for a decision on the merits after proper proceedings.-----Citations/PrecedentsThe case references the initial judgment of the High Court dated 14.09.2017 in writ petition No.1048 of 2016.The decision to seek a detailed report from the Deputy Commissioner/Collector, Muzaffarabad, for on-spot verification and factual clarity.The principles of ensuring equal treatment under law and eradicating discrimination, which guided the Supreme Court's reasoning to remand the case for a detailed hearing.",

The Court held that:The entries in the Nikahnama carry a presumption of truth, and the property listed as dower was not abandoned by the respondent.The gift deed executed during the pendency of the suit and in violation of the court?s prohibitory order was invalid.The civil courts had proper jurisdiction since the dispute involved a third party (Khatoon Begum) and was not solely between the husband and wife or a guarantor.----Citations/PrecedentsShahzad Rauf vs. Shabana Yasmin [2017 SCR 1522]Zafar alias Mumtaz & another vs. Mst.

The Additional Sessions Judge at Kotri convicted the petitioners on multiple counts, sentencing them to life imprisonment along with additional sentences and fines. The High Court upheld these convictions. The case stemmed from an incident on 15th June 1998, where the petitioners allegedly attacked and killed Rab Rakhio and injured Khamiso Khan over a family dispute related to a disapproved marriage. The petitioners appealed to the Supreme Court, challenging their convictions.----Issues:Did the prosecution establish the occurrence of the crime as alleged?Was the evidence sufficient to maintain the convictions of the petitioners despite the acquittal of a co-accused on similar evidence?Was the absence of weapon recovery critical to the prosecution?s case?----Holding/Reasoning/OutcomeHolding:The Supreme Court upheld the convictions and sentences of the petitioners, with a slight modification in the amount of Daman imposed.Reasoning:Ocular Testimony: The prosecution's case was primarily based on the eyewitness accounts of Haji Muhammad Siddique (PW-1), Ali Sher (PW-2), and the injured Khamiso Khan (PW-4). These witnesses provided consistent and detailed descriptions of the crime.Prompt Action: The witnesses promptly reported the crime, and Khamiso Khan was medically examined, which supported their accounts.No Mistaken Identity: Given the familial relationship, the court found no basis for mistaken identity or false implication.Acquittal of Co-Accused: The acquittal of Mehar Ali was based on his distinguishable and less significant role, and it did not undermine the overall integrity of the prosecution's case against the petitioners.Absence of Weapon Recovery: The failure to recover the weapons did not significantly weaken the prosecution's case, which was strongly supported by credible eyewitness testimony.Outcome: The petitioners? appeal was dismissed, and their convictions and sentences were maintained. However, the Daman imposed was reduced to Rs. 1000 due to the petitioners' advanced age.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: In the Supreme Appellate Court Gilgit-Baltistan, the petitioner filed a criminal appeal against the judgment dated November 22, 2017, in Cr. Revision No. 19/2017 passed by the Chief Court. The respondents had their criminal revision accepted by the Chief Court, which led to this petition for leave to appeal. The Supreme Appellate Court granted leave to appeal on May 23, 2018, and notices were issued to the respondents. The case was heard on June 27, 2018. ----Issues: The main issue was whether the provisions of Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, should be applied to the respondents, who were accused under 302/324/109/34 PPC of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and the Anti-Terrorism Act. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The appeal was dismissed, and the judgment of the Chief Court dated November 22, 2017, was maintained. The petitioner's counsel argued that the respondents' actions, which included indiscriminate firing resulting in injuries and deaths, created fear and insecurity, thus justifying the application of Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The respondents had confessed their guilt, and their actions were investigated by a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which confirmed their involvement. The respondents' counsel contended that the incident was a result of personal enmity and did not fall under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The Chief Court's judgment was argued to be correct, as the Anti-Terrorism Court did not have the authority to insert sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act based on an application from a party when the FIR was registered under ordinary law. The court agreed with the respondents, noting that the Anti-Terrorism Judge did not have jurisdiction to insert Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act based on the application. The court found no infirmity or illegality in the Chief Court's judgment and determined that the occurrence stemmed from a family dispute. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the Chief Court's judgment. ----Citations/Precedents Judgment dated November 22, 2017, in Cr. Revision No. 19/2017 by the Chief Court. FIR No. 11/2017 under Sections 302/324/109/34 PPC, and subsequent inclusion of Section 6/7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. Short order dated June 27, 2018, dismissing the appeal.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: A petition for leave to appeal was filed challenging the judgment and decree of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which upheld the dissolution of marriage between the petitioner and respondent. The respondent had filed for dissolution of marriage, citing cruelty, non-payment of dower, and non-performance of marital obligations. ----Issues: Whether the trial court erred in decreeing the dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty, non-payment of dower, and non-performance of marital obligations. Whether the High Court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's appeal was justified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court upheld the judgments of the trial court and the High Court, affirming the dissolution of marriage. The petitioner contended that the respondent failed to prove cruelty and other grounds for dissolution. However, the court found that the respondent provided sufficient evidence, including the petitioner's alleged illicit relations with another woman and failure to provide maintenance. The court emphasized that cruelty encompasses mental torture and not just physical abuse. Precedents were cited to support this interpretation. Additionally, the court noted that the petitioner's conduct, including contracting a second marriage, supported the respondent's claims. Furthermore, the court found that the case did not involve a substantial question of law of public importance, as required for an appeal under the Family Courts Act. Precedents were cited to support this point. -----Citations/Precedents: [2018 SCR 1167] (Muhammad Sohrab vs. Sobia Hayat) [2014 SCR 718] (Muhammad Sabil Khan and another v.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The case involves a dispute over guardianship of a minor, initiated when a guardianship certificate was issued to the appellants. Subsequently, an application for cancellation of the certificate was filed on grounds of fraudulent procurement. The trial court initially entertained the matter but later dismissed it, citing lack of jurisdiction due to the minor's residence abroad. The High Court upheld this decision, prompting the appeal before the Supreme Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for cancellation of the guardianship certificate. 2- Whether the jurisdiction of the court continues even after issuance of a guardianship order. Interpretation of relevant provisions under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, and the Family Courts Act, 1993. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the application for cancellation of the guardianship certificate despite the minor's residence abroad. It reasoned that the court's jurisdiction under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, persists until the minor reaches majority age. Moreover, the introduction of the Family Courts Act, 1993, does not negate this jurisdiction but rather specifies that family courts have exclusive jurisdiction over matters including guardianship. Therefore, the trial court's rejection of jurisdiction based on the minor's residence abroad was deemed incorrect. ----Citations/Precedents: Mst. Irshad Bibi vs. M.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: In this case, the Supreme Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir reviewed two criminal appeals arising from a consolidated judgment passed by the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court. The appeals involved Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti, convicted of murder, theft, and forgery, and Dr. Moheed Pirzada, the complainant, seeking enhancement of the sentence. The underlying incident involved the death of an elderly woman under suspicious circumstances, leading to allegations against her trusted servant, Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction of Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti for the murder of the deceased was justified based on the circumstantial evidence presented. 2- Whether the delay in filing the FIR impacted the credibility of the prosecution's case. 3- Whether the absence of certain procedural formalities and discrepancies in evidence warranted acquittal or a lesser sentence for Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti. 4- Whether the sentence of life imprisonment awarded to Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti should be enhanced to the death penalty. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The court held that the conviction of Tanveer Ahmed Bhatti was justified. The prosecution's circumstantial evidence, despite the absence of direct eyewitness testimony, formed a coherent chain linking Bhatti to the crime. His conduct, such as administering drugs to the deceased, misappropriating her funds, and obstructing family contact, supported the prosecution's case. The court found that the delay in filing the FIR did not significantly impact the case's credibility. The FIR was filed after the family conducted preliminary inquiries and became suspicious of Bhatti's actions. The court noted that the delay was reasonably explained by the family's initial shock and subsequent investigation. The court acknowledged minor procedural discrepancies, such as the absence of memos for transported samples and the lack of forensic examination of certain items. However, these were deemed insufficient to overturn the conviction. The overall evidence, including medical reports and witness testimonies, was found credible and consistent. The court declined to enhance Bhatti's sentence to the death penalty. While recognizing the heinous nature of the crime, the court emphasized the principle that life imprisonment is an equally severe and appropriate punishment in cases where mitigating circumstances exist. The court maintained that both death and life imprisonment are normal sentences under section 302(b) of the Azad Penal Code, and the trial court's decision to award life imprisonment was appropriate. -----Citations/Precedents: Khurshid vs. The State [PLD 1996 SC 305] Athar Aziz vs. The State [1996 SCR 225] Abdul Khaliq vs. Jehangir & another [1999 SCR 330] [2001 P.Cr.L.J. 827] Farmanullah vs. Qadeem Khan & another [2001 SCMR 1474] Abdul Rashid & 3 others vs. Abdul Ghaffar & 5 others [2001 P.Cr.L.J. 524] Zar Gul vs. The State [PLJ 2004 Cr.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant filed a civil appeal challenging the judgment and decree of the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which upheld the trial court's decision in favor of the respondent. The respondent had filed a suit for the recovery of dowry articles worth Rs. 116,415/- before the Judge Family Court, Mirpur. The trial court decreed in favor of the respondent for Rs. 89,915/- and dismissed the suit for the remaining Rs. 26,500/-. The appellant contested the judgment, claiming that the dowry list was not proven and that no dowry articles were delivered. Issues: 1- Whether the respondent's claim for recovery of dowry articles was sufficiently proven. 2- Whether the list of dowry articles was valid and credible. 3- Whether the judgments of the lower courts contained any misreading or non-reading of evidence. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Recovery of Dowry Articles: The respondent produced two witnesses and documentary evidence, including a list of dowry articles (Ex.PA). The witnesses corroborated the respondent's claim regarding the dowry articles. The appellant, however, denied the delivery of any dowry articles and claimed that the respondent's father received Rs. 65,000/- instead. The court found that the respondent's evidence was credible and sufficient to prove her claim for dowry articles worth Rs. 89,915/-. The court upheld the judgment awarding Rs. 89,915/- worth of dowry articles to the respondent. --Validity of Dowry List: The appellant argued that the dowry list was fabricated as it was not signed or proven with receipts. However, the court noted that there is no legal requirement for documenting dowry articles in such a manner. The court emphasized that in family matters, particularly dowry claims, the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, do not strictly apply, as per the AJ&K Family Courts Act, 1993. The respondent was not required to prove her case with the same rigor as in ordinary civil proceedings. The court found the dowry list (Ex.PA) credible and the respondent's evidence sufficient. --Misreading or Non-Reading of Evidence: The court examined the evidence presented and found that both the trial court and the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court had correctly appraised and appreciated the evidence. There was no misreading or non-reading of the record. The court concluded that the judgments of the lower courts were based on proper evaluation of evidence and did not warrant interference. ----Citations/Precedents: Saleem Akbar Kayani v. Dr. Rehana Mansha Kayani & 4 others [2016 SCR 1] Emphasizes the exclusion of Qanun-e-Shahadat and CPC provisions in Family Court proceedings to ensure expeditious resolution of family matters.

Shakeela Bibi vs. Muhammad Israr and others [2012 MLD 756] States that the sole testimony of a wife is sufficient to prove her claim for dowry articles in Family Court proceedings. Conclusion: The appeal was dismissed, and the judgments of the lower courts were upheld, confirming the decree for the recovery of dowry articles worth Rs. 89,915/- to the respondent. The appellant's objections regarding the dowry list and the alleged misreading of evidence were rejected.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant filed two suits before the Family Court in Muzaffarabad. The first suit was for the recovery of dower amounting to Rs. 500,000 in the form of a house, and the second suit was for past and future maintenance allowance at Rs. 15,000 per month. The Family Court decreed the suit for dower but limited the maintenance allowance to Rs. 5,000 per month for future maintenance, dismissing the claim for past maintenance. Both parties appealed to the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which upheld the Family Court's decision. The appellant then brought the case before the Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. ----Issues: 1- Whether the appellant is entitled to past maintenance allowance. 2- Whether the decree for dower in the form of a house is justified. 3- Whether the future maintenance allowance should be modified. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome --Past Maintenance Allowance: The Court held that the appellant was not entitled to past maintenance allowance. The evidence showed that the appellant left her matrimonial home voluntarily, and there was no proof of cruelty by the husband. The principle that a husband must maintain a wife applies only if the wife lives with him and is faithful. --Dower in the Form of a House: The Court upheld the decree for dower amounting to Rs. 500,000 in the form of a house. The evidence supported that the property was given as dower, but it was never transferred to the appellant. The Court found no reason to disturb the concurrent findings of the lower courts on this issue. --Future Maintenance Allowance: The Court maintained the future maintenance allowance at Rs. 5,000 per month, subject to the appellant\u2019s resettlement with her husband. This decision was based on the evidence and was deemed to be in accordance with the law. The appeals by both parties were dismissed, and the judgments and decrees of the Family Court and the High Court were affirmed. ----Citations/Precedents: Shahzad Rauf vs. Shabana Yasmin, 2017 SCR 1522 Muhammad Din vs. Muhammad Ashraf & others, 2005 SCR 225 Kamal Hussain vs. M.

The appellant went abroad before the birth of their second child, and the respondent No. 1 was allegedly ousted from the appellant's house by his grandfather in June 2010. Respondent No. 1 filed a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance, stating that the appellant had failed to maintain them. The Family Court decreed maintenance in favor of the respondents, which was later modified by the High Court to include past maintenance allowance. The appellant contested this modification. ----Issues: 1- Whether the respondents were entitled to past maintenance allowance. 2- Whether the Family Court and High Court correctly appreciated the evidence and facts of the case. 3- Whether mental cruelty was adequately considered in determining the entitlement to past maintenance. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome --Entitlement to Past Maintenance Allowance: The High Court modified the Family Court's judgment to include past maintenance allowance, granting Rs. 2,000 per month for six years. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, noting that past maintenance can be granted for up to six years based on the residuary Article 120 of the Limitation Act. --Appreciation of Evidence: The Supreme Court found that the Family Court had not fully appreciated the evidence, which showed that the appellant had not provided maintenance for 7-8 years. The respondent's statements and supporting witnesses indicated that the respondent was forced to live with her parents and received no support from the appellant. The appellant failed to produce any receipts or evidence of remittance to prove that he had provided maintenance. --Consideration of Mental Cruelty: The Court emphasized that cruelty is not limited to physical violence but includes mental torture and hateful behavior. The respondent No. 1's suffering due to lack of support and mental agony over several years was deemed sufficient to constitute cruelty, justifying her entitlement to past maintenance. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Zaheer-ud-Din Babar vs. Mst.

On February 10, 2020, the High Court dismissed the appellant's appeal for want of prosecution due to the non-appearance of the appellant's counsel. The appellant then moved an application for the restoration of the appeal, which was dismissed by the High Court on May 18, 2020. The appellant argued that his counsel was unable to attend the hearing due to personal engagements. ----Issues: 1- Whether the appellant showed sufficient cause for the restoration of the appeal dismissed for non-prosecution. 2- Whether the High Court erred in dismissing the application for restoration of the appeal on technical grounds rather than deciding on merits. 3- Whether the service of summons through substituted service (publication in a newspaper) was justified without direct attempts through ordinary modes. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome --Sufficient Cause for Restoration: The Supreme Court held that the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for the non-appearance of his counsel on the date fixed for hearing. The reason given, that the appellant assumed his counsel would appear, was deemed insufficient. The Court emphasized that both the litigant and counsel have responsibilities to ensure the proper prosecution of a case. --Dismissal on Technical Grounds: The Court noted that while valuable rights should ideally be decided on merits, procedural rules and the necessity of showing sufficient cause for non-appearance are critical to maintaining judicial discipline. The appellant's general assertion of personal engagements was inadequate to justify restoration. --Service of Summons: The Court did not find merit in the appellant's challenge regarding the service of summons through publication, as the specific issue of improper service was not adequately substantiated in the context of the restoration application. ----Citations/Precedents: Khwaja Ghulam Qadir and another vs. Muhammad Sharif & others [PLJ 2000 SC (AJK) 359]: Emphasized the necessity of showing sufficient cause for non-appearance.

The court decreed the suit in favor of the respondent on 21.4.2017. The appellant filed an appeal before the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir, which was dismissed on 16.5.2019 due to limitation. The appellant then filed a petition for leave to appeal before the Supreme Court, which was dismissed on 17.1.2020. During execution proceedings, the trial court ordered the appellant to transfer land and a house in lieu of the dower on 3.3.2020. The appellant challenged this order before the High Court, which dismissed the appeal on 12.8.2020, leading to the present appeal. ----Issues: 1- Whether the order dated 3.3.2020 passed by the Family Court is an interim or final order. 2- Whether the execution of the consent decree was valid and in accordance with the law. 3- Whether the allegation of tampering with the marriage certificate can affect the validity of the decree. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome --Nature of the Order: The Supreme Court concurred with the appellant\u2019s argument that the order dated 3.3.2020 is a final order and not an interim order. The order was a conclusive decision of the execution proceedings and not merely an interlocutory order. --Validity of Execution: The Court upheld the validity of the execution of the consent decree, stating that the decree dated 21.4.2017 had attained finality. The decree was based on a compromise and was challenged up to the Supreme Court in the first round of litigation. The execution proceedings aimed to implement this final decree. --Tampering Allegation: The allegation of tampering with the marriage certificate was deemed an afterthought and could not be considered at this stage. The appellant had the opportunity to raise this objection earlier, which was not done. The decree had already become a past and closed transaction. The Supreme Court found no substance in the appeal and affirmed the High Court's judgment, dismissing the appeal with no order as to costs. ----Citations/Precedents: Shahzad Rauf vs. Mst.

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The appellant filed four suits against the respondents in the Family Court, Muzaffarabad: For payment of dower of Rs. 4,25,525/-. For past and future maintenance allowance at Rs. 12,000/- per month. For dissolution of marriage on grounds of cruelty, non-performance of marital obligations, non-payment of dower, and maintenance allowance. For recovery of dowry articles or their value, Rs. 1,53,300/-. The respondent also filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights. The Family Court consolidated all suits and ruled in favor of the appellant. The respondents appealed to the Shariat Appellate Bench of the High Court, which modified the Family Court's decrees, granting maintenance allowance only for the Iddat period, dissolving the marriage in lieu of Khula for Rs. 100,000/-, and modifying the decree for dowry articles. The appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Azad Jammu & Kashmir. ----Issues: 1- Whether the dissolution of marriage should be based on cruelty or Khula. 2- Whether the appellant is entitled to past and future maintenance allowance. 3- Whether the dowry articles decree was correctly issued. 4- Whether the deferred dower of Rs. 3,25,525/- should be upheld. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Dissolution of Marriage: The Supreme Court held that the dissolution of marriage was rightly decreed by the Family Court on grounds of cruelty. The High Court's modification to Khula in lieu of Rs. 100,000/- was set aside. Evidence showed the appellant faced cruelty, including mental torture and harassment by the respondent's brother-in-law, which justified the dissolution on cruelty grounds. --Maintenance Allowance: The Supreme Court restored the Family Court's decree of Rs. 2,000/- per month maintenance from the date of the suit until the decision date, including the Iddat period. The appellant proved she was ousted from the respondent\u2019s house and was not maintained. --Dowry Articles: The Supreme Court reinstated the Family Court\u2019s decree for the recovery of dowry articles. The High Court's modification was found unjustified as the appellant proved the dowry articles were given at marriage and were in the respondent's possession. --Deferred Dower: The Supreme Court upheld the Family Court's decision that the appellant was entitled to the deferred dower of Rs. 3,25,525/- as per the marriage contract. ----Citations/Precedents: Muhammad Zaheer-ud-Din Babar vs. Mst.

The petitioner and respondent were married on May 18, 1990, with a prompt dower of Rs. 150 and a deferred dower of 34 tola and 6 masha gold. After their divorce on February 8, 2017, the respondent filed a suit for the recovery of the deferred dower, which was granted by the Additional District Judge/Judge Family Court on August 17, 2018. The petitioner's appeal to the High Court was dismissed, leading to this petition for leave to appeal. ----Issues: 1- Whether the Nikah deed and its entries were genuine. 2- Whether the deferred dower of 34 tola and 6 masha gold was paid. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The petitioner argued that the Nikah deed was prepared five years before the divorce and contained fictitious entries made on the respondent\u2019s wish, questioning its authenticity. The respondent's counsel argued that the High Court had already addressed the petitioner\u2019s claims and confirmed the deferred dower was unpaid. The Supreme Court held that the dispute pertained to the payment of the deferred dower, not the authenticity of the Nikah deed. The petitioner had not denied the deferred dower amount but claimed it was paid, which the respondent contested. The evidence supported the respondent\u2019s claim that the deferred dower remained unpaid. Both the trial and High Courts had provided well-reasoned judgments on this matter. The petition for leave to appeal was dismissed, as no legal ground existed for granting leave.",

The petitioner, who is the maternal grandmother and an American national, filed an application for the cancellation of the guardianship certificate, arguing that she was not made a party in the original proceedings and that she could better care for the minors. The trial court rejected her application, and the High Court upheld this decision. ----Issues: 1- Whether the petitioner was improperly excluded from the original guardianship proceedings. 2- Whether the application for cancellation of the guardianship certificate was filed within the appropriate time frame. 3- Whether the petitioner or the respondents are better suited to be the guardians of the minors. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Improper Exclusion: The court found that the petitioner was not a necessary party to the original guardianship application. The guardianship certificate was issued with the minors' welfare in mind, and the petitioner's exclusion did not invalidate the proceedings. --Timeliness: The petitioner's application for cancellation was deemed untimely. According to Rule 13 of the AJ&K Family Courts (Procedural) Rules, 1998, an application to set aside an ex-parte decision must be filed within 30 days of the decree, not from the date of knowledge. The court emphasized there is no provision for condonation of delay under this rule. --Best Interest of the Minors: The court concluded that the respondents, as the paternal grandparents, were best suited to be the guardians of the minors, given the petitioner's American residency and the stability provided by the respondents. The petition for leave to appeal was dismissed, affirming the decisions of the trial court and the High Court. ----Citations/Precedents: 2012 SCR 341",

Mumtaz is alleged to be a contractor earning around 40,000 to 45,000 per month. Mumtaz filed a suit for conjugal rights, claiming they lived a happy life until her mother instigated her to leave him. He sought a decree for restitution of conjugal rights. ----Issues: 1- Whether the dismissal of Mohammad Mumtaz's appeals by the High Court was justified. 2- Whether the petitioner should pay additional maintenance towards the decretal amount for the minor. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --High Court Decision: The High Court dismissed Mumtaz\u2019s appeals against the judgment of the Family Court, which had decided in favor of Riffat Kousar, granting her maintenance allowance and dissolving the marriage. --Supreme Court Decision: The Supreme Court reviewed the petitions for leave to appeal against the consolidated judgment of the High Court.

The petitioner argued that the decree was obtained fraudulently by using a wrong address, preventing proper notice, and that the point of limitation is a mixed question of law and facts requiring proof. Additionally, the petitioner contended that the power of attorney did authorize the filing of the appeal. The respondent countered that no fraud occurred, and the application was time-barred.

The case involved the appellant, convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The conviction and death sentence were confirmed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court. The appellant, along with other co-accused, was implicated in the murder of the complainant's relative over a family dispute. ----Issues: 1- Whether the conviction and death sentence of the appellant were justified based on the evidence presented. 2- Whether the delay in lodging the FIR affected the credibility of the prosecution's case. 3- Whether the principle of expectancy of life due to the lengthy appeal process should result in the alteration of the death sentence to life imprisonment. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court upheld the conviction and death sentence of the appellant, finding no mitigating factors to alter the sentence. The key points in the judgment included: Credibility of Evidence: The prosecution provided direct evidence from three eyewitnesses who consistently testified against the appellant. The defense failed to provide sufficient evidence to discredit their testimony. Delay in FIR: The court found the delay in lodging the FIR reasonable under the circumstances, as the priority was to secure medical assistance for the injured, who later succumbed to injuries. Expectancy of Life: The court rejected the argument that the appellant's prolonged imprisonment should alter the death sentence to life imprisonment. It cited previous cases where such grounds were deemed insufficient for altering the punishment. Recovery of Weapon and Forensic Evidence: The court acknowledged discrepancies in the recovery process but found them immaterial given the overwhelming direct evidence. Acquittal of Co-Accused: The court found no substantial evidence against the co-accused to overturn their acquittal. ----Citations/Precedents: Ansar Mehmood and another v.

She sought a decree for the recovery of the dowry articles listed in the plaint, or their value amounting to Rs. 1,61,950/-. The trial court partly decreed the suit, entitling the plaintiff to receive the dowry articles admitted by the defendant-appellant in the written statement. Dissatisfied with this decision, the respondent appealed to the High Court. The High Court partially accepted the appeal, modifying the judgment to allow the respondent to receive the market value of the dowry articles, which led to the appellant filing the present appeal before the Supreme Court. ----Issues: 1- Whether the High Court erred in modifying the trial court's judgment to allow the respondent to receive the market value of the dowry articles instead of the articles themselves. 2- Whether the appellant's readiness to return the dowry articles should negate the need for a monetary valuation. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court found that the High Court's modification of the trial court's decree, ordering the payment of the market value of the dowry articles, was unwarranted. The Court noted that the appellant was ready to hand over the dowry articles and that there was no concrete evidence presented to prove that the articles had been damaged. The Court emphasized that the execution of the decree should follow the trial court's original order, which entailed the return of the dowry articles. The Court held that any issues arising during the execution of the decree, such as damage to the articles, could be addressed by the executing court at that time. Therefore, the Supreme Court quashed the High Court's modification, reverting to the trial court's original decree.",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: An individual was appointed as a Judge of the High Court in Azad Jammu & Kashmir on February 24, 2011, and subsequently elevated to Chief Justice on April 3, 2017. An advocate challenged the appointment, alleging it violated Article 43(2-A) of the Azad Jammu & Kashmir Interim Constitution, 1974, claiming the required consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court was not properly conducted. The High Court initially dismissed the petition on technical grounds, but the Supreme Court directed the High Court to reconsider the petition on its merits. Upon reconsideration, the High Court delivered a split decision: one judge dismissed the petition while the other accepted it, leading to the appointment being set aside. The case was then referred to the senior-most judge of the High Court for a final decision. ----Issues: 1- Was the consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court after receiving advice from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council valid under Article 43(2-A) of the Constitution? 2- Does the principle of primacy attached to the Chief Justice's opinion apply in this appointment? Can a writ of quo warranto be issued against the individual given their elevation to Chief Justice? ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: The Supreme Court upheld the High Court's majority opinion that the appointment was unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that: The required consultation must be effective, meaningful, purposive, consensus-oriented, and simultaneous, which was not fulfilled in this case. The President had not applied the Rule of Primacy before seeking advice from the Council, nor after receiving it. The elevation to Chief Justice does not nullify the requirement for proper consultation for the initial appointment as a Judge. Therefore, the writ of quo warranto was valid.

The defendants were accused of having no rightful claim to the land, and the appellant sought to challenge the validity of a gift-deed executed in favor of the defendants. The trial court dismissed the suit, prompting an appeal to the District Judge, Mirpur.----Issues:Whether an amendment to the pleadings, specifically regarding the timing of a party's death, was necessary for a just decision.Whether the amendment sought by the appellant introduced a new case or prolonged litigation.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The Supreme Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir reviewed the appellant's request for amendment in light of legal principles. It determined that the proposed amendment was crucial for a just decision as it pertained to the timing of a party's death, which directly impacted the litigation's outcome. The Court emphasized that amendments should not introduce new cases or extend litigation unnecessarily. Considering the precedent set by previous cases and the facts presented, the Court allowed the appellant's amendment, finding it necessary and in line with legal standards.----Citations/Precedents:Abdul Rashid & another vs. Munir Akthar (2016 SCR 128)",

The counsel for both parties agreed on an installment amount of Rs. 30,000/- per month for the past period and for the running period.

The appellant appealed to the Shariat Court, which partly accepted the appeal regarding maintenance allowance but upheld the dissolution of marriage. The appellant filed this appeal challenging the Shariat Court's decision.----Issues:Whether the appellant is entitled to a decree of dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty.Whether the appellant's evidence sufficiently proves the ground of cruelty.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The appellant sought a decree of dissolution of marriage on the ground of cruelty. The Court examined the evidence presented by the appellant, including witness testimonies and statements. The Court found that the evidence sufficiently proved the husband's cruel conduct, including physical violence, snatching of ornaments, and failure to provide maintenance allowance. Citing relevant legal precedents, the Court concluded that cruelty, whether physical or mental, justifies the dissolution of marriage. Therefore, the Court accepted the appeal and passed a decree of dissolution of marriage in favor of the appellant on the ground of cruelty. No costs were awarded.",

The court held that the provisions of Section 6/7 of ATA did not apply to the case against the respondents/accused. It cited a previous judgment of the Division Bench of the same court which had set aside the decision of the Anti-Terrorism Court allowing the insertion of ATA provisions.

The arrest occurred on 17-01-2020 in Gilgit, and the FIR registered against him accused him under Section 420 PPC and Section 14 Foreigners Act. The petitioner claimed to be a Pakistani national and sought post-arrest bail through a petition under Section 497 Cr.P.C.----Issues:Whether Mir Wali Khan, the petitioner, qualifies for post-arrest bail despite being accused of offenses under Section 420 PPC and Section 14 Foreigners Act.Whether the petitioner's possession of a valid Form-B issued by NADRA and his family's long-term residency in KPK provide sufficient grounds for granting bail.Whether the offense under Section 14(1) of the Foreigners Act falls within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C., affecting the petitioner's eligibility for bail.----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome:The court granted post-arrest bail to Mir Wali Khan after considering several factors. Firstly, it noted that the offense under Section 420 PPC was bailable. Secondly, the petitioner's possession of a valid Form-B issued by NADRA, indicating his residency in Pakistan, supported his claim of Pakistani nationality. Additionally, the petitioner's father's death certificate, which indicated a long-term family residency in KPK, further substantiated his claim. The court reasoned that since the offense under Section 14(1) of the Foreigners Act did not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) Cr.P.C., the petitioner was entitled to bail. Consequently, Mir Wali Khan was admitted to post-arrest bail upon furnishing bail bonds of Rs.300,000/- with two sureties each in the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.-----Citations/Precedents:Section 497 Cr.P.C.Section 420 PPCSection 14 Foreigners ActNADRA (National Database and Registration Authority)",

        "Summary": "Case Summary: Background: The petitioner, filed a writ petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, challenging the appointment of Muhammad Akram (Respondent No.5) as Member Judicial, Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR), Islamabad. The petitioner sought a writ of quo warranto, questioning the legality of Respondent No.5's appointment, which was made through a notification dated 26.04.2019. The petition was filed on 01.06.2023, after a lapse of over four years since the appointment. ----Issues: 1- Whether the acquittal of Respondent No.5 from a criminal case, based on a compromise, can be considered an honorable acquittal. 2- Whether the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, provides any restrictions or conditions relating to character verification during the probationary period of Respondent No.5. 3- Whether the writ of quo warranto is maintainable. 4- Whether the writ petition is hit by laches. 5- Whether the office occupied by Respondent No.5 is a public office, and if so, whether he occupies it lawfully. ----Holding/Reasoning/Outcome: --Honorable Acquittal:The court found that the acquittal of Respondent No.5, based on a compromise in a family property dispute, is considered honorable. The acquittal was upheld by both the Judicial Magistrate and the Additional Sessions Judge, Sargodha. The court noted that all acquittals, including those based on compromise, are deemed honorable as they imply the prosecution's failure to prove the charges. Reliance was placed on previous judgments such as \"DR. MUHAMMAD ISLAM vs. GOVERNMENT OF NWFP\" (1998 SCMR 1993) and \"MUMTAZ ALI SHAH vs. CHAIRMAN, PAKISTAN TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY LTD.\" (PLD 2002 Supreme Court 1060). ---Character Verification under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001:The court observed that Section 130(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which governs the appointment of Judicial Members of the ATIR, does not provide any specific restrictions or conditions related to character verification during the probationary period. The Respondent No.5 was appointed after meeting the eligibility criteria specified in the ordinance. ---Maintainability of the Writ of Quo Warranto:The court held that the writ of quo warranto is discretionary and should not be issued as a matter of course. It is intended to address exceptional cases where a person holds a public office without legal authority. The court emphasized the importance of the petitioner's bona fides and the absence of extraneous motives. Given the delay in filing the petition and the lack of substantial evidence against the respondent, the court found the petition to be frivolous and lacking bona fides. References were made to \"JAWAD AHMAD MIR vs. Prof. DR. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN\" (2023 SCMR 162) and \"ASIF HASSAN vs. SABIR HUSSAIN\" (2019 SCMR 1720).- ----Laches:The court applied the principle of laches, noting the significant delay in filing the petition. The petition was filed over four years after the impugned appointment, without any convincing reason for the delay. The court cited \"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN vs. IMTIAZ ALI KHAN\" (2012 SCMR 280) and \"MEMBER (S&R)/CHIEF SETTLEMENT COMMISSIONER, BOARD OF REVENUE, PUNJAB vs. Syed ASHFAQUE ALI\" (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 132), reinforcing that undue delay in seeking judicial relief can bar the petitioner's claim.- ---Public Office and Lawful Occupation:The court concluded that the office of Member Judicial, ATIR, is a public office created by the state and governed by statute. The Respondent No.5 was lawfully appointed to this office, having met all the necessary qualifications and criteria stipulated in Section 130(3) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. The court referred to \"M.U.A. KHAN vs. RANA M. SULTAN\" (PLD 1974 Supreme Court 228) and other relevant case law to affirm that the respondent holds the office lawfully. The court dismissed the petition, finding no merit in the petitioner's claims. The Respondent No.5's appointment was deemed lawful, and the petition was barred by laches. The court emphasized the need for petitions of quo warranto to be filed promptly and based on substantial grounds, not extraneous motives or undue delay. ----Citations/Precedents:\"DR.

The Court noted that previous judgments emphasize the importance of consent to protect the fundamental rights of individuals. The Court also mentioned that in the absence of consent, the trial court can draw an adverse inference as per Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, and decide the paternity issue based on the evidence provided by the parties.
