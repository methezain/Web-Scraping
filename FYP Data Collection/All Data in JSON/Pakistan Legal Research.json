        "Client Name": "Farooq Omar Bhoja (Petitioner)",
        "Opponent Name": "Federation of Pakistan through Ministry of Law & Justice (Respondent)",
        "Relationship": "nan",
        "Issue Type": "Whether sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929, which provide punishments for the person above eighteen years, who marries a girl child under 16 years of age, punishment for a person who solemnize a child marriage and punishments to parents/guardians of a girl child respectively, are against the spirit of Islam Holy Quran and Sunnah.",
        "Summary": "The Court deliberated upon the Ahadith, mentioned by the petitioner in favour of his claim and commented that after careful reading of these Ahadith, two principles can be established for marriage with a minor girl; first principle is that such Nikah can only be contracted through wali and second principle states that marriage will be consummated, when the girl is considered to be medically adult, which depends upon the cast, creed, food, weather conditions, economic and social circumstances of that girl. On the basis of these two principles, the Government of Pakistan has fixed  minimum sixteen years age for a girl to get married.  The Court further discussed certain acts, which are associated with the personality of  Holy Prophet (PBUH), and cannot be applied in the same manner in cases of ordinary human beings, because, all of his acts, were directions of Allah, for him only, and not for all and sundry. The Court also discussed various acts, which are lawful, but have been suspended for betterment and welfare of society by Hazrat Umar (R.A) in his capacity as second Caliph. It is a well-settled principle of  Sharia that if any lawful act appears to be harmful to the society collectively or to a particular segment of a society, the State has power to make that act prohibited so that the society can be protected from a larger damage.  It was also discussed that majority of muslim jurists believes that marriage of a minor girl is permissible, but some religious scholars disallows such nikkah, so, in order to develop balance, the Government of Pakistan set the age of sixteen years for the marriage of a girl. Moreover, setting sixteen year, age of marriage of a girl, would give her chance to get basic education, as there is no doubt on significance of education for both male and female, and especially for the latter, as she is usually responsible for educating and managing daily affairs of her children.",

        ],
        "Outcome": "The Court held that for a healthy marriage, not only physical health and economic stability etc. are necessary factors but mental health and intellectual development is equally important, which are achievable through education. Islam recognizes the significance of education for male and female alike and believes in empowerment of women for development and prosperity for a family in specific and for society in general. This is the rationale behind setting the minimum threshold of sixteen year age for a girl to get married by the State of Pakistan. Hence, the Court is of considerate opinion that this petition is misconceived and liable to be dismissed.",

        "Issue Type": "Whether petitioner can take the minor out of Pakistan to the USA for the purposes of immigration and adoption?",
        "Summary": "The court believes that  the petitioner took care of the child and custody with the permission of her parents and thereafter through a legal process, she was appointed as a guardian by the competent Court of law. She, therefore, wanted to apply for the immigration of the child to her own country for adoption and also because the minor may get proper treatment for her ailments.The US Embassy has its own rules for granting immigration visa and the requirement of law is that word “adoption” be mentioned in the order dated 19 -1 -2011 -of guardianship.The Court further discussed that that the minor is a born Christian and would not be governed by the Muslim Personal Law.",

        "Outcome": "Hence, the Court concluded that now after the appointment of petitioner as guardian, she has got every lawful right to keep the child with her after proper consent of minor’s real parents. She wants to keep the child with her in USA and welfare of the minor also demands her better care and treatment.Since there is no Inter-country Adoption between Pakistan and U.S. the minor will enter U.S. on immigration visa and shall be adopted over there according to the U.S. laws.In view of the above, the Court is of the opinion that the children after going through all the process of guardianship should be permitted to accompany their lawful guardians. Especially when the parents have also no objection to the removal of minor to a foreign country in connection with adoption. Muslim Laws are different, but in the present case, the minor is a Christian and her parents have given the said permission.The petition is therefore, allowed and the petitioner is permitted to take the minor to the United States of America for the purpose of immigration and adoption. The required amendment is directed to be made and the original guardianship order dated 19-1-2011 shall be read as such.",

Moreover, in view of order dated 11th March 2011, passed by Canadian Superior Court (Family Division), the minor has to be returned to the lawful custody of the petitioner in Canada. On the other hand, the Counsel for defendant, challenged the jurisdiction of the Court, and said that it fall under the purview of Guardian and Wards Act, 1890. He further claimed that relationship between petitioner and defendant must be considered legitimate, as both of them lived together with their  free consent. Moreover, petitioner, being a non-muslim by faith, has been unfit to have the custody of child, and respondent, being muslim, should be given the custody of child.",

This means that, the said Court,  in its constitutional jurisdiction cannot reappraise the evidence and decide the case on its facts.

        "Outcome": "The Court held that, the honourable High Court erred in deciding upon facts of the case, that were already decided by the lower courts. In case, high courts would be allowed to play the role of appellate court, then, a unstoppable floodgate of cases would be opened before it. So, once the case has been finalized by the trial courts or the appellate courts, the high courts should not indulge itself in re-checking the facts, and play the role designated to it under relevant laws of Pakistan, and put an end to excessive litigation, for dispensation of early justice.  In the light of foregoing, this Petition is dismissed.",
