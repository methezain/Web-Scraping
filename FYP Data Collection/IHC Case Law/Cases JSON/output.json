        "Summary": ".  Mr.  Ali  Waqas  Sheikh,  Advocate  for  the \n\npetitioner.  \n\n  The petitioner is aggrieved by judgment \n\nand  decree  dated  07.04.2021  through  which \n\nmaintenance  of \n\nrespondent  No.3,  minor \n\ndaughter  of  the  petitioner,  was  fixed  as \n\nRs.15,000/-  and  the  judgment  and  decree  of \n\nthe  learned  Additional  District  Judge  dated \n\n12.07.2021  pursuant  to  which  the  appeal \n\nagainst  said  judgment  and  decree  of  the \n\nlearned Family Court was dismissed.  \n\n2. \n\nLearned  counsel \n\nfor \n\nthe  petitioner \n\nsubmitted  that  the  petitioner  was  unwell  at \n\nthe  time  that  the  impugned  judgment  and \n\ndecree  were  passed  by  the  learned  Family \n\nCourt  and  his  counsel  did  not  inform  him \n\nregarding  the  judgment  and  decree.  That  on \n\n19.05.2021 \n\ncounsel \n\nfor \n\nthe  petitioner \n\ninformed  him  via  text  message  that  suit  for \n\nrecovery  of  maintenance  had  been  decreed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2.       W.P No. 4011/2021 \n\nagainst  him.  The  learned  counsel  for  the \n\npetitioner  submitted \n\nthat \n\nthe  period  of \n\nlimitation  had  already  expired  and \n\nthe \n\npetitioner  subsequently  filed  an  appeal  which \n\nwas also dismissed being time barred.      \n\n3. \n\n  The  argument  of  the  petitioner  is  that \n\nthe  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  suffer \n\nfrom  infirmity  merely  because  the  petitioner \n\nhad sufficient cause for not appearing on the \n\ndate  on  which  the  impugned  judgment  and \n\ndecree  were  passed.  That  it  was  due  to \n\nnegligence  of  his  counsel  that  the  said \n\njudgment and decree were not brought to the \n\nattention of the petitioner and this fact of the \n\nmatter  was  not  appreciated  by  the  learned \n\nappellate  court.  The  submission  of  the \n\nlearned \n\ncounsel \n\nfor \n\nthe  petitioner \n\nis \n\nmisconceived. \n\nIn \n\nthe  event \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\npetitioner\u2019s  duly  authorized  and  appointed \n\ncounsel  failed  to  appear  before  the  court  on \n\nthe  date  on  which  the  judgment  and  decree \n\nwere passed, the remedy of the petitioner lies \n\nagainst  such  counsel  and  burden  of  any \n\ndelinquency  on  part  of  his  counsel  cannot  be \n\nshifted to respondents No. 3 and 4.  \n\n4. \n\n  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner \n\nhas  failed  to  point  out  any  infirmity  either  in \n\nthe  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the \n\n \n\f3.       W.P No. 4011/2021 \n\nlearned  Family  Court  pursuant  to  which  the \n\nmaintenance  in  the  amount  of  Rs.15000/- \n\nhas  been  fixed  for  the  petitioner\u2019s  minor \n\ndaughter  nor  has  been  able  to  point  out  any \n\ninfirmity  in  the  Judgment  of  the  learned  \n\nAdditional District Judge. The learned counsel \n\nhas  also  not  pointed  out  any  misreading  or \n\nnon-reading  of  evidence  on  part  of  the \n\nlearned  Family  Court  and  has  failed  to \n\nestablish  that  the  amount  of  maintenance \n\nfixed  by \n\nthe \n\nlearned  Family  Court \n\nis \n\nprohibitive in view of means of the petitioner.     \n\n5. \n\n  For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  this  petition \n\nis without merit and is dismissed in limine.  \n\nSaeed. \n\n                                JUDGE",

Vide  the  said  judgment  and  decree \n\ndated  20.09.2020, \n\nthe  suit \n\nfor  recovery  of \n\nmaintenance  filed  by  respondents  No.1  to  3  was \n\ndecreed by the learned Judge Family Court.  \n\n2. \n\nRespondent  No.1  is  the  petitioner\u2019s  wife \n\nwhereas \n\nrespondent  No.2 \n\nis  his  son  and \n\nrespondent  No.3  is  his  daughter.  Learned  Family \n\nCourt  had \n\nfixed  maintenance  amounting \n\nto \n\nRs.12,000/-  per  month  for  respondent  No.1  from \n\nthe date of the institution of the suit with an annual \n\nincrease  of  6%.  Furthermore,  maintenance \n\namounting to Rs.12,000/- per month was also fixed \n\nfor  each  of the  petitioner\u2019s  children from  the date \n\nof the institution of the suit with an annual increase \n\nof  10%.  The  learned  Appellate  Court  modified  the \n\nsaid \n\njudgment \n\nand  decree  by \n\nreducing \n\nmaintenance  of  respondent  No.1  and  for  each  of \n\nthe  petitioner\u2019s  children  to  Rs.8,000/-  per  month \n\nwith  an  annual \n\nincrease  of  6%.  The  past \n\nmaintenance  to  which  the  learned  Family  Court \n\n \n                \n \n \n  \n \n \n\f2 \n\n W.P.No.2076/2021 \n\nhad  held  respondents  No.1  to  3  entitled  to  was \n\nalso reduced.  \n\n3. \n\nThe only argument advanced by the learned \n\ncounsel  for  the  petitioner  was  that  since  the \n\npetitioner  had  divorced  respondent  No.1,  on \n\n17.11.2020, he could not have been burdened with \n\npaying  maintenance  to  respondent  No.1  beyond \n\nthe  expiry  of  the  iddat  period.  Learned  counsel \n\nfurther  submitted  that  the  reason  why  the  factum \n\nof  the  divorce  was  not  pleaded  in  his  appeal  was \n\nbecause  the  divorce  had  taken  place  after  the \n\nappeal was filed. There is nothing on the record to \n\nshow that the petitioner had brought to the notice \n\nof the learned Appellate Court the fact that he had \n\ndivorced respondent No.1 on 17.11.2020.  \n\n4. \n\nThe  petitioner  cannot  escape  his  obligation \n\nto  pay  maintenance to  respondent  No.1 by  simply \n\nproducing  a  copy  of \n\nthe  talaqnama  dated \n\n17.11.2020.  How  a  talaq  becomes  effective  has \n\nbeen  explained  in  the  judgment  reported  as 1986 \n\nSCMR 1350.  A  person  having  pronounced  talaq \n\nwas  required  to  give  the  Chairman,  Arbitration \n\nCouncil a written notice of him having done so and \n\nwould  supply  a  copy  thereof  to  his  wife.  Such \n\nnotice  of  talaq \n\nto  a  wife \n\nis  a  mandatory \n\nrequirement  of  the \n\nlaw.  A  divorce  becomes \n\neffective  after  the  expiry  of  90  days  from  the \n\nreceipt  of  notice  by  the  Chairman,  Arbitration \n\nCouncil  in  terms  of  Section  7",

Respondent  No.1  entered  into  Nikah \n\nwith  the  petitioner  on  08.06.2016  against  the  dower  of  Rupees \n\nOne Million, the payment of which, was to be made promptly on \n\ndemand.  Respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage \n\non  the  basis  of  Khula,  which  was  allowed  vide  judgment  and \n\ndecree  dated  20.02.2017  with  the  condition  that  respondent  No.1 \n\nshall relinquish the dower. Respondent No.1 filed an appeal before \n\nthe learned District Judge, which was allowed vide judgment dated \n\n03.10.2017, whereby condition of relinquishment was removed.  \n\n2.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner inter alia  contended  that \n\npetitioner  had  paid  dower  of  Rupees  One  Million  to  respondent \n\nNo.1, hence she had to relinquish/payback the same for dissolution \n\nof marriage to be effective as required under the law.  \n\n3.  Learned counsel for respondent No.1 inter alia contended that \n\nno  dower  was  paid  by  the  petitioner  to  respondent  No.1;  even-\n\notherwise,  respondent  No.1  now  has  contracted  Nikah;  that \n\njudgment  impugned  does  not  suffer  from  any  illegality  or \n\njurisdictional error. \n\n \n \n \n\fW.P. No.4095-2017 \n\n2 \n\n4.  Arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties have \n\nbeen  heard  and  the  documents,  placed  on  record,  examined  with \n\ntheir able assistance. \n\n5.  The factual background, leading to filing of instant petition, is \n\nmentioned hereinabove therefore need not be reproduced.      \n\n6.  The claim of respondent No.1 is that dower was never paid \n\nand in this behalf, during course of trial, she also led evidence.  \n\n7.  The  assertion  of  respondent  No.1  remained  un-rebutted \n\ninasmuch  as  petitioner  was  proceeded  exparte  and  eventually, \n\nexparte  judgment  and  decree  was  passed  against  him  on \n\n20.02.2017.  \n\n8.  There  is  nothing  on  record  to  controvert  the  position  of \n\nrespondent No.1, whereby she had categorically stated in the plaint \n\nas  well  as  in  the  evidence  that  dower  amount  of  Rupees  One \n\nMillion  had  not  been  paid  to  her.  The  petitioner,  though  in  the \n\nreply  to  the  suit,  asserted  that  dower  amount  had  been  paid  yet \n\nhe was proceeded exparte and no evidence was led to the effect.  \n\n9.  The  petitioner  never  made  any  attempt  to  have  the  exparte \n\njudgment  and  decree  set  aside  and  even  challenge  exparte \n\njudgment  and  decree  dated  20.02.2017.  Even,  in  the  instant \n\npetition, no such request was made.  \n\n10.  Section  10",

Vide the order dated 08.10.2020, \n\nthe  respondent  was  held  entitled  for  grant  of \n\ninterim monthly maintenance allowance at the rate \n\nof Rs.20,000/- from the petitioner. \n\n2. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits \n\nthat the petitioner is working overseas as a labour; \n\nthat  respondent  filed  a  suit  for  restitution  of \n\nconjugal  rights  and  recovery  of  maintenance;  that \n\nvide  the  impugned  orders,  the  learned  Judge \n\nFamily Court has fixed interim maintenance, which \n\nis beyond the petitioner\u2019s paying capacity; that the \n\npetitioner  wants  to  live  with  the  respondent;  that \n\nthe  respondent  is  a  disobedient  wife;  that  no \n\nmaintenance  can  be  awarded  to  a  disobedient \n\nwife;  and  that  the  impugned  orders  have  been \n\npassed  without  application  of \n\njudicial  mind. \n\nLearned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  the \n\nwrit  petition  to  be  allowed  and  for  the  impugned \n\norders  dated  07.01.2021  and  08.10.2020  to  be  set \n\naside. \n\n3. \n\nI  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned \n\ncounsel  for  the  petitioner  and  have  perused  the \n\nrecord with his able assistance. \n\n                \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4. \n\nAdmittedly,  marriage  between  the  petitioner \n\nand  the  respondent  is  still  intact  and  respondent \n\nhad  to  file  the  suit inter-alia seeking  restitution  of \n\nconjugal  rights.  So \n\nfar  as \n\nthe  quantum  of \n\nmaintenance \n\nis  concerned,  the  petitioner  has \n\nplaced  on  record Nikahnama  dated  04.01.2018.

        "Summary": "Bano Jahangir Raja, Advocate. \n\nThrough  instant  writ  petition,  petitioner \n\nimpugns judgment and decree dated 21.09.2019 \n\n&  20.01.2020,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge \n\nFamily  Court  and  the  learned  Additional  District \n\nJudge,  Islamabad-West,  respectively  whereby \n\nthe  two  suits  one  for  recovery  of  maintenance \n\nallowance,  gold  ornaments  and  the  other  for \n\ndowry  articles,  filed  by  respondent  No.3  were \n\npartially  decreed  while  appeal  filed  by  the \n\npetitioner was dismissed being time barred.   \n\n2.   \n\nThe decree passed and affirmed was to \n\nthe following effect:- \n\n\u201cRespondent  No.3  was  held  entitled  to \nrecovery  of  maintenance  allowance  for \nherself from March 2015 till February 2019 \n@ Rs.2000/- per month, recovery of nine \ntola gold ornaments or as alternate its \nmarket value and  remaining dowry articles \nincluding six  dresses, a sewing machine, \nplastic set and  water tank or  as  alternate \nRs.35000/-.\u201d \n\n3.   \n\nRecord made available by the petitioner, \n\nshows that the decree-in-original was passed on \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 1343-2021 \n\n                                         -2- \n\n21.09.2019 while petitioner assailed the same in \n\nappeal  on  08.11.2019,  after  one  month  and \n\nsixteen  days  which,  under  the  law,  had  to  be \n\nfiled  within  thirty  days.  The  learned  Appellate \n\nCourt  dismissed  the  appeal  on  the  ground  of \n\nlimitation,  inter-alia,  observing  that  \u201ethough the \n\npetitioner had taken the ground of sickness but did \n\nnot provide any medical certificate, thus failed to \n\nexplain each and every day\u201fs delay, mandatory to \n\nask for condonation.\u201f  \n\n4.   \n\nIt \n\nis \n\nimportant \n\nto  mention \n\nthat \n\njudgment-in-appeal  was  passed  on  20.01.2020 \n\nwhile \n\ninstant  writ  petition  was \n\nfiled  on \n\n01.04.2021  i.e.  after  delay  of  more  than  one \n\nyear and two months. \n\n5.   \n\nLearned counsel argued that the learned \n\nFamily Court failed to appreciate the evidence in \n\nits  true  perspective;  that  sufficient  cause  has \n\nbeen  put  forth  for  condonation  of  delay  which \n\nwas  supported  by  medical  certificate  but  the \n\nappellant  had  been  non-suited  on  technical \n\nground of limitation in derogation to the principle \n\nthat  law  favours  decision  on  merits  instead  of \n\ntechnicalities.  \n\n6.   \n\n7.   \n\nHeard, record examined.  \n\nThere  is  no  denial  that  appeal  before \n\nthe  learned  Additional  District  Judge  had  been \n\nfiled beyond the prescribed period of thirty days \n\nwhile it is also an admitted fact that instant  writ \n\npetition,  whereby  petitioner  intends  to  have \n\n \n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 1343-2021 \n\n                                         -3- \n\nequitable and discretionary relief, has  been filed  \n\nwith  a  delay  of  more    than  one  year  and  two \n\nmonths. \n\n8.   \n\nDuring the course of arguments, learned \n\ncounsel  tried  to  justify  inordinate  delay  in  terms \n\nthat  petitioner  had  been  incarceration  for  two \n\nmonths  but  whether  this  would  be  sufficient \n\neven to ask for? Answer would be in negative for \n\nthe reason that there is no explanation of rest of \n\nthe long standing period of one year, even, if the \n\nperiod  of  two  months  is  excluded.  Like  the \n\nground  of  sickness  in  appeal,  the  ground  being \n\npressed  for  condoning  the  delay/laches  in  filing \n\nof  instant  writ  petition  is  also  without  any \n\nsubstance and is accordingly repelled. \n\n9.   \n\nThe \n\npetitioner \n\nintends \n\nto \n\nhave \n\ndiscretionary  and  equitable \n\nrelief  without \n\nexploring  malafide, \n\nillegality \n\nor  material \n\nirregularity in the judgment of the learned Family \n\nCourt. It is cardinal principle that law favours the \n\nvigilant  and  not  the  indolent.  Undoubtedly,  law \n\nleans  adjudication  of  cases  on  merits  instead  of \n\ntechnicalities yet the fact remains that each and \n\nevery  decision  on  the  point  of  limitation  could \n\nnot  be  set  at  naught  on  any  flimsy  ground \n\nwithout  reasonable,  justifiable  and  convincing \n\ncause  which  can  be  assessed  and  termed  as \n\n\u201csufficient\u201d.  \n\n10. \n\nAnother  important  aspect  of  the  matter \n\nis  that  petitioner  had  already  availed  statutory \n\n \n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 1343-2021 \n\n                                         -4- \n\nremedy  of  appeal.  Recourse  in  terms  of  Article \n\n199 of the Constitution to question the decisions \n\nof  the  two  courts  of  competent  jurisdiction,  in \n\nabsence  of  any  illegality  or  jurisdictional  defect \n\nwould  not  be  appropriate,  particularly  when  the \n\nconduct of the petitioner appears to be lethargic \n\nthroughout.  \n\n11. \n\nIn  the  present  case,  the \n\nlitigation \n\ncommenced  in  January  2016,  finally  decided  by \n\nthe learned Family Court in September 2019. The \n\npetitioner assailed the said decision in November \n\n2019, while his appeal was dismissed in January, \n\n2020.  Thus  a  family  dispute  consumed  more \n\nthan  four  years  for  reaching  final  conclusion \n\nbefore the two forums which had to be decided \n\nwithin six months from the date of institution \n\nin  terms  of  section  12A  of  the  Family  Courts \n\nAct, 1964. \n\n12. \n\nIt is cardinal principle that \u201eequity aids \n\nthe vigilant and not the indolent\u201f.  He,  who \n\nknocks  the  door  of  equity  court  with  inordinate \n\ndelay, has to justify such delay. There is no cavil \n\nwith \n\nthe  proposition \n\nthat \n\nthere  exists  no \n\nstatutory provision prescribing limitation for filing \n\nof writ petition but that does not mean to sleep \n\nupon a right for unlimited time and to agitate the \n\nsame  when  other  party  resorts  his/her  right, \n\nparticularly \n\nin \n\nfamily  matters  where \n\nthe \n\nlegislative \n\nintent \n\nis  unambiguous \n\nregarding \n\ndecisions summarily.  \n\n \n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 1343-2021 \n\n                                         -5- \n\n13. \n\nThe  delay  in  approaching  the  forum \n\nprovided  through  enactment  is  matter  of  fact \n\nand gives/creates valuable rights in favour of the \n\nother party but even approaching this Court with \n\ninordinate  delay  of  14/15  months  when  is \n\nexamined  in  juxtaposition,  leads  to  form  a  view \n\nthat  facts  of  the  case  attract  the  maxim \u201edelay \n\ndefeats equity\u201f.  \n\n14. \n\nThe  conduct  of \n\nthe  petitioner \n\nin \n\napproaching  this  Court  asking  for  relief  in  terms \n\nof Article 199 of the Constitution in the backdrop \n\nof the facts of the instant case cannot be termed \n\nas aboveboard rather appears to be negligent. In \n\nsuch  like  situation,  equitable  relief  by  this  Court \n\nin  exercise  of  its  extra  ordinary  jurisdiction \n\ncannot  be  granted.

        "Summary": ". \n\nLUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ, J.  \n\nThrough \n\ninstant \n\npetition, \n\nthe \n\npetitioner Shahzad Liaqat has assailed  Ex-parte  judgment and decree dated \n\n26.10.2019,  passed  by  learned  Judge,  Family  Court-West,  Islamabad  in \n\nFamily  Suit  No.  136/2016,  which  was  upheld  by  the  learned  Additional \n\nDistrict  Judge,  MCAC,  West-Islamabad,  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated \n\n07.11.2020, passed in Family Appeal No. 40/2020.  Hence, through present \n\npetition, the petitioner prayed for following relief:- \n\n\u201cIn  the  light  of  foregoing  legal  and  factual  positions,  it  is  most \nrespectfully prayed that this Honourable Court may graciously be \npleased to accept the instant writ petition, set-aside the impugned \njudgment  /  decree  dated  07.11.2020,  Ex-parte  judgment/decree \ndated  26.10.2019,  Ex-parte  order  dated  24.07.2019  and  order \nprovision  of  one single  Opportunity of  hearing  on a fixed date to \nthe petitioner for fair administration of law and justice.\u201d.   \n\n2. \n\n Brief  facts  are  that  the  respondent  filed  a  suit  for  dissolution  of \n\nmarriage on the basis of Khula, past maintenance w.e.f. July, 2015 till Iddat \n\nperiod  at  the  rate  of  100,000/-  per  month  and  recovery  of  dowry  articles \n\naccording  to  list  or  Rs.  1,380,500/-  as  an  alternate.  The  suit  was  ex-parte \n\ndecreed,  vide  judgment  dated  26.10.2019,  whereby  the  maintenance \n\nallowance at the rate of Rs. 25,000/- per month w.e.f. 20.07.2015, till expiry \n\nof Iddat period i.e. 28.12.2016 and the recovery of Rs. 367,500/- in lieu of \n\nremaining  dowry  articles  and  recovery  of  gold  ornaments  worth \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fShahzad Liaqat v. Mst. Asfa Batool, etc  2 \n\nW.P. No. 3936 of 2020 \n\nRs.261,000/-  or  its  value  as  an  alternate  was  ordered  to  be  paid  to \n\nRespondent No.1/Plaintiff. The judgment and decree dated 26.10.2019  was \n\nassailed  in  appeal  before  the  Additional  District  Judge,  MCAC,  West-\n\nIslamabad, u/s 14 of the Family Courts, Act who, vide judgment and decree \n\ndated  07.11.2020,  passed  in  Family  Appeal  No.  40  of  2020,  dismissed  the \n\nappeal  filed  by  the  petitioner  on  the  ground  of  limitation  as  it  was  filed \n\nbeyond the period of 30 days prescribed under the law. Hence, present Writ \n\nPetition  assailing  judgments  and  decree  dated  26.10.2019  &  07.11.2020, \n\nrespectively. \n\n3. \n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the delay on the part \n\nof petitioner in filing appeal was unintentional. He submitted that during the \n\nproceedings the case was transferred to another Judge and, therefore, before \n\npassing  any  adverse  order  against  the  petitioner,  the  learned  Judge  was \n\nrequired to issue notice to the petitioner, however, no such notice was issued \n\nbefore  commencing  the  trial  proceedings  by  the  learned  Judge,  who  has \n\npassed the impugned order; that it has been well settled that decision should \n\nbe  based on  merits  and not on technicalities.  He  further  submitted  that the \n\nright  to  defend  the  case  has  been  seriously  prejudiced  before  the  learned \n\nTrial Court, therefore, he requested to grant a single opportunity to plead his \n\ncase before the learned Trial Court.  \n\n4. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.  1  strongly \n\ncontroverted  the  contentions  of  the  petitioner  and  submitted  that  appeal \n\nbefore  the  learned  Appellate  Court  was  filed  beyond  the  limitation  of  30 \n\ndays provided in the Family Court Act, 1964/Rules 1965. He submitted that \n\nOrder  by  the  learned  Trial  Court  was  passed  on  26.10.2019,  whereas,  the \n\nappeal  before  the  learned  Appellate  Court  was  instituted  on  17.02.2020, \n\ntherefore, the learned Appellate Court has rightly dismissed the appeal of the \n\npetitioner on the point of limitation as it is well settled that delay of each and \n\n \n\fShahzad Liaqat v. Mst. Asfa Batool, etc  3 \n\nW.P. No. 3936 of 2020 \n\nevery  day  is  to be  explained.  He,  therefore,  prayed  for  dismissal  of  instant \n\npetition. \n\n5. \n\nArguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard  and \n\nrelevant  record  including  the  impugned  judgments  and  decree  have  also \n\nbeen perused. \n\n6. \n\nAdmittedly,  the  impugned  judgment  dated  26.10.2019,  has  been \n\npassed  against  the  petitioner",

On  notice,  the \n\npetitioner  appeared  and  contested  the  suit  by  filing  written \n\nstatement.  That  on  25.01.2021,  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court-\n\nWest, Islamabad without hearing the petitioner has fixed the interim \n\nmaintenance at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month for each minor as \n\ninterim  maintenance,  which  is  too  harsh.  Feeling  aggrieved  from \n\nthe  order  dated  25.01.2021,  the  petitioner  has  filed  instant  writ \n\npetition. \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that  the \n\nimpugned order for interim maintenance for the respondents No. 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nW.P No.394 of 2021 \n\n&  4  is  illegal,  unlawful  and  against  the  law  and  facts  of  the  case; \n\nthat  while  fixing  interim  maintenance  of  respondents/minors, \n\nlearned  Family  Court  without  hearing  the  petitioner  and  without \n\nrecording  evidence,  passed  the  impugned  order,  therefore,  the \n\nimpugned order is  result of misreading  and non-reading of record; \n\nthat the fixation of Rs. 50,000/- per month for each minor is higher \n\nthan  the  petitioner\u2019s  total  monthly  income  and  is  against  the \n\nprinciples  of  natural  justice;  that  the learned Family  Judge  without \n\nkeeping  in  view  the  petitioner\u2019s  financial  capacity  has  passed  the \n\nimpugned  order  ,  who  himself  is  a  heart  patient,  bearing  his \n\nmedical  expenses  as  well  as  treatment  of  his  ailing  wife,    who  is \n\nsuffering  from  cancer  .  Further  contended  that  the  learned  trial \n\nCourt  only  on  the  pleadings  of  respondent  believed  that  the \n\npetitioner  is  earning  at  a  higher  rate  and  on  the  request  of \n\nrespondents  has  fixed  the  monthly  maintenance,  which  is  highly \n\nexorbitant. Lastly, prayed for acceptance of writ petition.  \n\n4. \n\nConversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  has  opposed \n\nthe  contention  of  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  has \n\ncontended  that  the  order  impugned  before  this  Court  is  of \n\ninterlocutory nature, therefore, the petition in its present form is not \n\nmaintainable;  that  it  is  the  duty  of  petitioner  being  father  of  the \n\nminors  to  maintain  them  and  to  provide  all  the  requisites  of  life \n\nincluding  education,  food,  clothing,  shelter  to  the  minors  and  the \n\npetitioner being father is not providing the necessities to them; that \n\nthe petitioner has contracted second marriage and is not interested \n\nin the welfare of minors.  Lastly, urged for dismissal of petition.  \n\n5. \n\nI have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties \n\nand have perused the material available on record.  \n\n6. \n\nPerusal of the record reveals that the respondents No. 3 & 4 \n\nfiled  suit  for  maintenance  through  their  mother  i.e.  respondent \n\nNo.2,  who  are  residing  with  custody  of  their  mother.  The  learned \n\nTrial Court has tentatively assessed an amount of Rs.50,000/- each \n\nper month as maintenance for the financial needs of the minors as \n\ninterim maintenance allowance. \n\n7. \n\nThe learned Judge Family Court passed the impugned order \n\ndated 25.01.2021 in terms of the provisions of Section 17-A of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nW.P No.394 of 2021 \n\nWest  Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  which  was  added  to  the \n\nPakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 vide Ordinance IV of 2002. Under \n\nSection  17-A  Ibid,  a  Family  Court  has  the  jurisdiction  to  pass  an \n\ninterim order for maintenance at any stage of the proceedings in a \n\nsuit  for  maintenance.    The  relevant  section  is  reproduced  as \n\nunder:- \n\n\u201cAt  any  stage  of  proceedings  in  a  suit  for \nmaintenance,  the Family Court  may  pass  an \ninterim order for maintenance, whereunder the \npayment  shall  be  made  by  the  fourteenth  of \neach month, failing which the Court may strike \noff  the  defence  of  the  defendant  and  decree \nthe suit.\u201d  \n\n8. \n\nThe  law  has  vested  discretion  with  the  Family  Court  for \n\nfixation  of  interim  maintenance  which  will  be  merged  into  final \n\ndecision  of  the  Trial.  The  purpose  behind  section  17-A  of  the \n\nenactment  is  to  ensure  that  during  the  pendency  of  suit,  financial \n\nneeds  faced  by  the  minors  are  to  be  fulfilled.  There  is  no  specific \n\nprovision  of  law  on  the  basis  of  which  the  Family  Court  is  to \n\nexercise its discretion with regard to fixing the interim maintenance \n\nof the minor.

After  execution  of  said  divorce  deed,  the \n\npetitioner  applied  to  the  respondent  No.1  for  issuance  of  certificate \n\nof effectiveness of divorce according to provisions of Muslim Family \n\nLaws  Ordinance,  1961  through  application  dated  30.08.2018.  The \n\npetitioner  also  engaged  a  counsel  to  proceed  with  the  pending \n\nproceeding.  On  26.09.2018,  statement  of \n\nthe  petitioner  was \n\nrecorded before the respondent No.1. Petitioner revoked his divorce \n\ndeed  vide  revocation  deed  dated  17.10.2018  and  reconciled  with \n\nrespondent  No.2  on  the  interference  of  elders  of  both  the  families \n\nwell  before  the  next  date  of  hearing  before  respondent  No.1.  The \n\npetitioner  accordingly \n\ninformed  his  counsel  about \n\nthe  same \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\n\u201cW.P No.3360 of 2020\u201d \n\nrevocation  deed  and  reconciliation  with  respondent  No.2  in  a \n\nmeeting  and  asked  him  to  withdraw  the  application  filed  under \n\nSection  7,ibid,  much  earlier  than  the  expiry  of  90  days  period.After \n\nexecution  of  above  mentioned  revocation  deed  and  reconciliation, \n\npetitioner started living with respondent No.2 happily. Surprisingly, in \n\nthe  month  of  June,  2020,  the  petitioner  came  to  know  that  the \n\nrespondent  No.1  issued  a  divorce  certificate  dated  28.11.2018  and \n\nhis learned counsel had forgotten qua the case of petitioner pending \n\nwith  respondent  No.1  due  to  rush  of  work.  The  petitioner  at  the \n\nearliest  applied  to  respondent  No.1  for  the  cancellation  of  divorce \n\ndeed  vide  application  dated  19.06.2020,  however  the  office  of \n\nrespondent  No.1  straight  away  refused  by  saying  that  there  is  no \n\nprovision of cancellation of divorce certificate, hence this petition.  \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that  the \n\nimpugned  action  of  respondent  No.1  is  without  lawful  authority  and \n\nagainst the principles of natural justice; that the respondent No.1 has \n\nfailed to appreciate the points involved in case in its real perspective \n\nwhile  refusing  to  entertain  the  application  of  petitioner;  that  the \n\npetitioner  already  revoked  the  divorce  deed  dated  17.10.2018  well \n\nwithin prescribed period of ninety days; that the impugned action of \n\nrespondent No.1 for refusing to entertain the application of petitioner \n\nwithout  any  written  findings  is  tenable.  Further  contended  that  the \n\npetitioner  and  respondent  No.2  is  ready  to  appear  before  this \n\nHon\u201fble  Court  for  recording  their  respective  statements  regarding \n\ntheir  re-conciliation  and  revocation  of  divorce  deed.  Lastly,  prayed \n\nfor acceptance of instant petition. \n\n4. \n\nConversely, \n\nlearned  counsel \n\nfor \n\nrespondent  No.1  has \n\nopposed the contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioner \n\nby contending that the petitioner submittedapplication for issuance of \n\ndivorce  effectiveness  certificate;  that  he  appointed  a  \u201cSalis\u201d  for  him \n\nas  required  under  the  Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961;  that \n\nafter  adopting  due  process,  proclamation \n\nin  newspaper  was \n\npublished  for  appearance  of  respondent  No.2;that  the  petitioner \n\nappeared  on  26.09.2018  before  the  respondent  No.1  and  recorded \n\nhis  statement  that  the  reconciliation  between  the  parties  has  been \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\n\u201cW.P No.3360 of 2020\u201d \n\nfailed;  that  the  petitioner  did  not  intimate  the  respondent  about  the \n\nrevocation of divorce deed dated 17.10.2018; that the petitioner did \n\nnot  pursue  the  matter  and  finally  after  expiry  of  ninety  days,  the \n\ndivorce  effectiveness  certificate  was  issued  on  30.11.2018.  Lastly, \n\nhe urged for dismissal of petition. \n\n5. \n\nI have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties \n\nand  have  perused  the  material  available  on  record  with  their  able \n\nassistance. \n\n6. \n\nPerusal of the petition reveals that the petitioner was married \n\nto  the  respondent  No.2  Mst.  SundalHammad.  On  28.08.2018,  the \n\npetitioner  pronounced  \u201cTalaq\u201d  to  her.On  30.08.2018,  thepetitioner \n\nfiled  an  application  to  the  respondent  No.1",

Facts, essential for adjudication of instant \n\nwrit  petition  are  that  petitioners  filed  suit  for \n\nrecovery  of  dower,  dowry  articles  and \n\nmaintenance  allowance  wherein on  15.12.2020, \n\non  the  request  of  respondent  No.3/defendant, \n\nthe  learned  Family  Court  fixed  a  meeting \n\nschedule in terms noted in Para-1 above. Being \n\ndissatisfied  with  the  said  schedule,  petitioners \n\nfiled  an  appeal  but  the  same  was  dismissed \n\nbeing  not  maintainable,  hence  instant  writ \n\npetition. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                          \n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 84-2021 \n\n                                         -2- \n\n3.       According  to  the  learned  counsel,  the \n\nlearned  court  of  first  instance  travelled  beyond \n\nthe  jurisdiction  vested  in  it  by  fixing  meeting \n\nschedule  as  the  lis  pending  is  with  regard  to \n\nrecovery  of  maintenance  allowance  and  not  a \n\nguardian  petition;  that  respondent  No.3  has \n\nalready  filed  a  guardian  petition  before  the \n\nlearned Guardian Judge at Rawalpindi where he \n\ncan  ask  for  the  relief  sought  and  that  the \n\nrespondent  No.3  is  chronic  patient  of  skin \n\ndisease and his exposure may cause irreparable \n\ninjury \n\nto \n\nthe  health  of  minor, \n\ntherefore, \n\nimpugned orders are liable to be  set aside.   \n\n4.

April 2011 while  for \n\nthe respondents 4 to 6 at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month \n\nw.e.f.  June  2013  till  their  majority  besides  Rs.2,68,350/- \n\nschool fee of respondent No.4 and Rs.71,600/- the amount \n\npaid  by  her  parents  as  educational  fee  of  the  petitioner. \n\nBesides  the  said  suit,  respondent  No.3  also  filed  a  suit  for \n\n \n \n \n\fWrit Petitions 867-2020. \n                                                            - 2 \u2013 \n\nrecovery  of  dower  amount  to  the  tune  of  Rs.1  Million  and \n\ntwenty tolas gold ornaments.  \n\n3. \n\n    The  petitioner  contested  the  suit  by  filing  written \n\nstatement he controverted the stance of the respondents by \n\nasserting  that  he  was  living  in  the  house  of  parents  of \n\nrespondent No.3; that he was expelled out of the house in \n\nJune 2016 and that he had been paying all the school fee of \n\nthe respondents 4 to 6 from his own pocket till June 2016. \n\n4. \n\n    The  learned  trial  Court  out  of  divergent  pleadings \n\nof  the  parties,  framed  necessary  issues  and  recorded \n\nevidence of the parties.  Respondent No.3 appeared as PW-\n\n1, tendered affidavit P1, Nikah Nama  P2, Form B Mark PA, \n\nbirth  certificates  of  minors  Mark  A2  to  Mark  A4,  marriage \n\nregistration  certificate  Mark  A5,  fee  challans  Mark  A6/1  to \n\nMark  A6/19.  On  the  other  hand,  petitioner\u2019s \n\nfather \n\nMuhammad Younas appeared as DW-1 and tendered power \n\nof attorney and affidavit Ex.D1 and Ex.D2 respectively. The \n\nlearned  trial Court after hearing the parties, dismissed the \n\nsecond  suit  of    respondent  No.3  for  recovery  of  dower \n\namount and gold  ornaments while partially decreed the suit \n\nof  the  respondents  for  recovery  of  maintenance  in  terms \n\nthat  respondents  4  to  6  were  held  entitled  to  recovery \n\nmaintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  per  month  each \n\nfrom  July  2016  till  their  legal  entitlement  with  5%  annual \n\nincrease while claim of the respondent No.3 for  recovery of \n\nmaintenance  allowance  was  dismissed.  Hence,  the  instant \n\nwrit petition.  \n\n5. \n\n    Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argued  that  the \n\nevidence  on  record  establishes  the  fact  that  the  petitioner \n\nsince  day  one  of  the  marriage  had   been  living  in  parental \n\nhouse of respondent No.3; that petitioner has no legitimate \n\n \n \n \n \n\fWrit Petitions 867-2020. \n                                                            - 3 \u2013 \n\nsource  of  income  at  present  while  on  the  other  hand, \n\nrespondent  No.3  is  a  working  lady  having  permanent  job \n\nand  source  of  income  while  it  is  also  established  from  the \n\nevidence  that  the petitioner  had been  contributing  towards \n\npayment of maintenance, therefore, in absence of sufficient \n\nfinancial  means, \n\nthe \n\nimpugned  maintenance \n\nis \n\ntoo \n\nexcessive, therefore, impugned judgment and decree to this \n\nextent are liable to be modified. \n\n6. \n\n    On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the \n\nrespondents  3  to  6  argued  that  from  the  statement  of \n\nwitness  of  petitioner,  it  is  evident  that  the  petitioner  hails \n\nfrom  a  well-off  family  and  living  with  his  parents  while  the \n\nmaintenance  fixed,  in  the  present  days  of  inflation,  in  no \n\nway can be termed excessive, therefore, petition is liable to \n\nbe dismissed.  \n\n7. \n\n    Heard  the  learned  counsels  for  the  parties  and \n\nperused the record with their able assistance.  \n\n8. \n\n    The  pivotal  point  in  the  case  is  that  whether  the \n\ncourse  adopted  by  the  learned  Family  Judge  and  affirmed \n\nby the learned Appellate Court qua fixation of maintenance, \n\nto be paid by the petitioner/father is in accordance with the \n\nevidence on record besides the law on the subject. \n\n9. \n\n    The  Hon\u2019ble  Apex  Court  in  case  law  reported  as \n\n\u201cMuhammad Asim v.

        "Summary": "Mr. Majid Ali, Advocate.\n\nThrough the instant writ petition, petitioner\nimpugns  order dated 15.09.2020  passed  by the\nlearned Judge Family Court, lslamabad-East\nwhereby application  of the petitioner/defendant for\nreduction of interim  maintenance  allowance was\ndismissed.\n2.  Relevant  facts are that the respondents  1 to 3\nfiled a  suit for the recovery of maintenance\nallowance against the petitioner, wherein interim\nmaintenance  at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month for\neach minor was fixed; the petitioner had been\nworking  abroad in UAE and on his arrival back to\nthe country, filed an application  for reduction  of the\ninterim maintenance  with the stance that due to\nCovid-19 pandemic  he became jobless,  therefore,\nthe amount fixed as interim maintenance  may be\nreduced. The learned Guardian Judge dismissed\nthe said application vide order dated 15.09.2020,\nhence  the instant writ petition.\n3.  Learned  counsel contends that the petitioner\nhad been paying the interim maintenance as\ndirected by the learned Guardian  Judge but due to\npandemic  of Covid-19, he became jobless and,\ntherefore,  unable to pay the same being not in\nconsonance with his financial  position while the\nrespondent  No.1 is a working  lady and being rea!\n\n\fWrlt  PeUUon  No.  27742020\n\n-2-\n\nmother  may help in maintaining  the minors.  Learned\ncounsel placed  reliance  upon case laws reported as\n\n2017 tlLD 214 and 2014 CLC 715.\n4.  Heard, record perused.\n5.  Record reveals that interim maintenance\nallowance  of the two minors was fixed at the rate of\nRs.10,000/- per month each in September,  2019 and\nthe petitioner  paid the same for initial six months  till\nFebruary 2O2O and thereafter  came-up with the\napplication  for  reduction of  the  interim\nmaintenance  after six months. lt is manifest from\nthe record that he requested for waiver of interim\nmaintenance  for a period of six months. During the\nsaid period, the petitioner did not pay even\nRs.5000/-  per month as he prayed  through  the\ninstant writ petition in terms of maintenance  to the\nminors to show his readiness  and left the minors\nunattended in those hard days which cannot be\nconsidered as an excuse to absolve him from his\nduty. lt is settled principle  that it is the bounden\nduty of  the father to  maintain his children\nirrespective of the fact that they are residing  with\ntheir mother.\n6.  The learned  Family Court has already dealt\nthe petitioner with leniency  by making  three\ninstalments  of  the  outstanding amount  of\nmaintenance.\n7.  The dispute between  the parties is in respect\nof maintenance  which is a schedule  item as per\nFamily Court Act, 1964. Being  a special law, remedy\nof an appeal against the interim order has been\nexcluded from the statute  by the legislature.  When\nremedy to challenge an interim order is not\nprovided through statutory  provision, then it does\nnot amount that by way of filing writ petition against\n\n\f)\n\nWrit  Petition  No.  277412020\n\n-3-\n\nan interim order, same remedy could be availed. At\nthis score alone, the instant writ petition  is not\nproceedable.\n8.  The case law relied upon by the learned\ncounsel do not extend any help to the petitioner\ndue to having  distinct facts and circumstances.\n9. \nln view of above, there exists  no justification\nto interfere  in the impugned order. Consequently,\nthe instant writ petition is dismissed  in limine.\n\nlmran",

Being  aggrieved, \n\nthe  appellant \n\nfiled \n\nComplaint  under  Consumer  Protection  Act,  Islamabad,  1995 \n\nbefore  the \n\nlearned  Consumer  Court,  Additional  Sessions \n\nJudge,  Islamabad, but the learned Judge Consumer Court after \n\nhearing the  learned counsels for the parties held that the above \n\nmentioned  offences  are triable  by  Magistrate  and  directed that \n\nthe file  be sent to the  concerned  Magistrate for  the  purpose of \n\ntrial  and fixed  the  next date  as  07.11.2018.  Feeling aggrieved, \n\nthe appellant has filed the instant appeal. \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  she \n\nmoved  from  one  lab to  another  due  to  the  act  of  respondents \n\nNo.1 \n\nto  3;  the  whole  family  of  the  appellant  suffered  mental \n\ntorture  whereas  respondent  No.1 \n\nis  not  actually  having  the \n\nfacility  of  such  test,  but  this  factum  was  not  disclosed  to  the \n\nappellant. \n\n4. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents \n\nvehemently  opposed  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned \n\ncounsel  for  the  appellants  contending  that  the  respondents \n\nhave  purchased  the  said  laboratory  on  18.11.2017,  whereas \n\nthe  complaint  has been filed  by the  name  of accused  persons, \n\nhence the instant appeal is  not maintainable against them. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments heard, record perused. \n\nBefore proceeding further with the main case, in  intend to \n\ndecide the instant  C.M No.02 of 2019 . \n\n\f3 \n\nen. Appeal  No.23 of 2019 \n\n7. \n\nThis  is  an  application  for  condonation  of  delay  under \n\nSection  5  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908.  This  application  was \n\ncontested by the learned counsel for the respondent contending \n\nthat  the  appeal  has  been  filed  after  an \n\ninordinate  and \n\nunexplained  delay  of  21  days.  The  record  reveals  that  the \n\ninstant  appeal  has  been  filed  on  01.12.2018  against  the \n\njudgement  dated  22.09.2018  but  the  diary  branch  raised \n\nvarious  objections  including  that  the  object  appeal  is  time \n\nbarred  for  21  days.  This  objection  is  misconceived.  The \n\njudgement  was  passed  on  22.09.2018.  The  application  for \n\nobtaining  certified  copies  of  said  judgement  was  filed  on \n\n09.10.2018  which  was  ready  on  27th  October  2018  but  the \n\nappellant  was  not  informed  by  the  Copying  Agency  about  the \n\npreparation  of  the  certified  judgment.  Whereas,  the  appellant \n\nreceived the  certified  copy of the  impugned judgement  on  19th \n\nNovember  2018,  as  such,  all  the  circumstances  were  beyond \n\ncontrol  of  the  appellant,  therefore,  the  time  consumed  in \n\nobtaining  the  certified  copy  of  judgement  was  beyond  the \n\ncontrol  of  the  appellant,  therefore,  keeping  in  view  the  above \n\nfacts  and  circumstances,  the  delay  caused  in  filing  the  instant \n\nappeal  after  21  days  is  condoned.  For the  reasons  mentioned \n\nin  the  application,  supported  by  an  affidavit,  the  same  is \n\nallowed.  Reliance  in  this  regard  is  placed  upon  the  case \n\nreported  as  \"Shujahat  Hussain  VSMuhammad  Habib And \n\nAnother'",

J. \n\nThe petitioner [Farhad alias  Fawad] seeks post \n\narrest  bail  in  case  FIR  No.  246,  dated  31.12.2017, \n\nunder  sections  395,  412  PPC,  registered  at  Police \n\nStation Noon, Islamabad. \n\n2. \n\nBrief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  on  the  written \n\nreport  of the  complainant  [Tariq  Hussain  Shah]  F.l.R \n\nNo.  246  was \n\nlodged  against  unknown  accused \n\npersons stating therein that when he opened the main \n\ngate of his house to see-off his  cousin Basharat Shah, \n\nsuddenly  six  persons  armed  with  pistol  entered  into \n\nthe  house  and  locked  all  persons  of  the  family  in  a \n\nroom.  They  started  searching  his  house  and  took \n\naway  20  tolas  gold,  consisting  of  bangles,  necklace, \n\near  rings  etc  including  amount  of  Rs.1,25,000/-  on \n\ngun point.  They also snatched amount of Rs.12,000/  \n\nfrom  his cousin. \n\n3. \n\nThe  petitioner  applied  for  post  arrest  bail \n\nbefore  the \n\nlearned  Court  of  Judicial  Magistrate \n\nSection-30,  Islamabad, which was  rejected vide order \n\ndated  08.07.2020. Thereafter,  the  petitioner/  accused \n\napplied \n\nfor  bail  after  arrest  before \n\nthe \n\nlearned \n\nAdditional  Sessions  Judge-West,  Islamabad,  which \n\nmet  the  same  fate  vide  order  dated  23.07.2020, \n\nhence the instant petition. \n\n4. \n\nLearned  counsel \n\nfor  the  petitioner  contends \n\nthat  the  petitioner  is  innocent  and  has  falsely  been \n\nimplicated  in  this  case; \n\nthat  the  petitioner  has  not \n\ncommitted  any  offence  as  alleged  in  the  FIR;  that \n\n\f2 \n\nCRL.MISC.  N0.927-B  /2020 \n\nrecovery of only  Rs.3000/- has allegedly  been shown \n\nas  recovery from the  petitioner; that  no other material \n\nhas  been  recovered  from  his  possession;  that  the \n\npetitioner was  involved  in  the  case  on the  disclosure \n\nof  co-accused  Ahsanullah  and  one  Liaqat,  who  later \n\non,  have been discharged from  the  case; that  on the \n\nsame  set  of  evidence, \n\nthe  co-accused  Namely \n\nNawab  Khan  has  been  granted  bail  by  the  learned \n\nASJ,  Islamabad, vide order dated 27.06.2020 and the \n\npetitioner  is  also  entitled  for  the  same  relief  on  the \n\nbasis of rule of consistency; that  there  is  no evidence \n\nto  connect  the  petitioner  with  the  commission  of \n\noffence;  that  the  petitioner  is  previously  non-convict \n\nand case of present petitioner  falls within the ambit of \n\nfurther inquiry. Further contended that the petitioner is \n\nbehind the bars since his arrest; that the  investigation \n\nof  the  case  has  been  completed  and  petitioner  is  no \n\nmore  required for  further  investigation.  Lastly  prayed \n\nfor acceptance of this bail petition. \n\n5. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  learned  State  counsel \n\nvehemently opposed the grant of bail to the petitioner \n\ncontending that the petitioner was identified during the \n\ncourse  of  identification  parade  by  the  complainant; \n\nthat  the  offence  is  not  bailable  and  the  offence  falls \n\nwithin  the  prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497  Cr.P.C. \n\nLastly urged for dismissal of the instant bail petition. \n\n6. \n\nI  have heard the arguments of learned counsel \n\nfor  the  petitioner,  State  Counsel  and  have  perused \n\nthe  material  available  on  record  with  their  able \n\nassistance. \n\n7. \n\nPerusal  of \n\nthe \n\nrecord \n\nreveals \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\ncomplainant has mentioned six unknown culprits, who \n\nhave allegedly entered  into  his  house and committed \n\ndacoity.  The  physical  features  and  specific  role  has \n\nnot been attributed to any of the culprit. It  is transpired \n\nfrom  the  record  that  one  Ahsan  Ullah,  Liaqat  and \n\nRehman  Ullah, who  were  arrested  in  case  F.l.R  No. \n\n66/2018  registered at  Police Station  Shamas Colony, \n\nIslamabad, they  made  disclosure  that  they  alongwith \n\npetitioner  have  committed  dacoity  in  the  house  of \n\n\f3 \n\nCRL.MISC.  N0.927-B  /2020 \n\ncomplainant,  but  later on  they  were  discharged  from \n\nthe  case.  It  is  also  transpired  from  the  record  that \n\nrecovery  of  Rs.  6000/-  have  been  shown  from  the \n\npossession  of  co-accused  Rehman  Ullah.  Similarly, \n\nRs. 7000/- have also been shown as recovery from the \n\ncustody  of  Ahsan  Ullah,  but  later  on  both  of  them \n\nwere  discharged.  The  identification  parade  was  not \n\nheld  in  accordance  with  the  principles  laid  down  by \n\nthe  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  therefore,  the  case  of \n\npetitioner  falls  within  the  ambit  of  further  inquiry  in \n\nterms of the Section 497 Cr.P.C. At this stage, deeper \n\nappreciation of  material available on  record is  neither \n\ndesirable  nor permissible. The  guilt  of  accused  is  yet \n\nto  be  determined  by  the  learned  trial  Court  after \n\nrecording  of  the  evidence.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme \n\nCourt of Pakistan in  the case reported as  \"Manzoor & \n\nfour others  VS The State\"  [PLO 1972  SC 81),  it  has \n\nheld as under:- \n\n\"  It  is  important to  remember that  bail \n\nis  not  to  be  withheld  as  a  punishment. \n\nThere  is  no  legal  or  moral  compulsion  to \n\nkeep  people \n\nin \n\njail  merely  on \n\nthe \n\nallegation \n\nthat \n\nthey  have  committed \n\noffences  punishable  with  death  or \n\ntransportation, unless reasonable grounds \n\nappear to exist to disclose their complicity. \n\nThe  ultimate  conviction  and  incarceration \n\nof  a  guilty  person  can  repair  the  wrong \n\ncaused by a  mistaken relief of interim  bail \n\ngranted \n\nto  him,  but  no  satisfactory \n\nreparation  can  be  offered  to  an  innocent \n\nman for his  unjustified incarceration at any \n\nstage of the case albeit his acquittal in  the \n\nlong run.\" \n\n8. \n\nSo  far  as  the  contention  of  the  learned  State \n\ncounsel  that  similar  nature  of  other  cases  have \n\nalready  been  registered  against  the  petitioner  is \n\nconcerned, \n\nthere \n\nis  no  previous  record  of \n\nthe \n\npetitioner to have been convicted in  the said cases as \n\nsuch,  he  cannot  be  treated  as  hardened criminal and \n\n\f4 \n\nCRL.MISC.  N0.927  -B  /2020 \n\nit  cannot  be  a  ground  to  withhold  the  concession  of \n\nbail.  Reliance  in  this  regard  is  placed  upon the  case \n\nreported  as  \"Babar  Hussain  VS  The  State  and \n\nanother'",

It  has  been  further  averred  in  the  plaint  that \n\nthe  minor is school going.  Her school fee, transportation,  medical, food, \n\nclothing and other expenses  are  more  than  Rs.89,590/- per  month.

Next contended  that  the  petitioner is dependent  upon \n\nhis  disabled  brother,  who  is  running  the  \u201cKhokha\u201d  for  his  livelihood  and \n\nhis  elder  brother  is  also  paying  monthly  Rs.5000/-  for  the  minor.  Lastly  \n\nprayed  for  acceptance  of  writ  petition  and  for  reduction  in  maintenance  \n\nallowance. \n\n5. \n\nConversely,  learned counsel for  the respondent  has  opposed  the \n\ncontention  raised  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contending \n\nthat no  maintenance has been  deposited by  the petitioner  for the  minor. \n\nThe  minor is  school going.  The  learned  Trial  Court has rightly assessed \n\nthe monthly maintenance at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per month and urged \n\nfor dismissal  of the  instant  petition. \n\n 6. \n\nI have heard  the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and \n\nhave  perused  the  material  available  on record.   \n\n7. \n\nPerusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the  respondent  has  filed  a  suit \n\nfor maintenance of the  minor, who is in the custody of respondent  No.1. \n\nThe  learned  Trial  Court  on  submission  of  written  statement,  has \n\nassessed an amount of  Rs.20,000/- per  month for the financial needs of \n\nthe  minor,  as interim  maintenance  allowance.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nW.P No.1780 of 2020 \n\n8. \n\nThe learned Judge, Family Court, had passed the impugned order \n\nin  terms  of  the  provisions  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family \n\nCourts Act, 1964,  which  was  added  to  the West  Pakistan Family Courts \n\nAct,  1964  vide  Ordinance  No.IV  of  2002.  Under  Section  17-A  ibid,  a \n\nFamily  Court  has \n\nthe \n\njurisdiction \n\nto  pass  an \n\ninterim  order \n\nfor \n\nmaintenance  at any stage  of the  proceedings in  a  suit for  maintenance. \n\nWhere  such  interim  maintenance  is  fixed,  payment  is  required  to  be \n\nmade  on  the  fourteenth  day  of  each  month  failing  which  the  Family \n\nCourt  is  empowered  to  strike  off  the  defense  of  the  defendant  and \n\ndecree  the  suit.  \n\n9. \n\nThe  purpose  behind  the  provision  of  interim  maintenance  is  to \n\nensure  that  during  the  pendency  of  the  suit  before  the  learned  Judge \n\nFamily  Court,  financial  constraints  faced by the  minors  are ameliorated.   \n\n10.  The stance  taken  by the petitioner in his  petition did not persuade \n\nme  to  interfere  in  the  impugned  order,  which  is  interim  in  nature.  The \n\npetitioner,  who  is  the  father  of  the  minor,  cannot  expect  her  mother  to \n\nkeep  her  and  also  to  pay  all  her  expenses.  However,  the  petitioner  is \n\nunder  a  legal  as  well  as  a  moral  obligation  to  maintain  and  support  his \n\nchildren,  more  so when  they  are minors.   \n\n11. \n\nIn  this  regard,  I  am  fortified  by  the  law  laid  down  in  the  case  of \n\nSyeda  Farhat  Jehan  v.  Syed  Iqbal  Hussain  Rizvi",

No.  28,  dated  17.03.2012,  U/s \n\n335/324/341/34  PPC, P.S Nilore, Islamabad. \n\n2. \n\nBrief facts  referred  in  the  instant  appeal  are  that  the  appellant  Raja \n\nMuhammad  Yasin had  lodged the  complaint  Exh.PA to  the  S.H.O, P.S Nilore, \n\nIslamabad  with  the  allegation  that  on  16.03.2012,  his  son  Raja  Muhammad \n\nSafeer, who is  police employee alongwith  his  son  Ali and  his  wife Mst. Iram \n\nvisited the  doctor  on  their  vehicle. At about  09:30  pm,  when  they  reached  on \n\nthe  main  road  of Village Mohri, the  road  was  blocked  by placing  stones  and \n\nbricks.  Two persons  were seen  and  identified by them  as  Zeshan  alias  Shani \n\nS/o  Parvez, Village Mohra  and  Arshad  S/o  Musarat,  Village Ara, who raised \n\nLalkara  and  asked  them  to  hand  over  everything.  In  the  meanwhile  three \n\nunknown  persons  were seen who were standing  at  some distance,  however they \n\ncould  not  be  identified,  that  Raja  Muhammad  Safeer  slightly  reversed  his \n\nvehicle, whereupon  both  the  accused  persons  opened  fire which  landed  on the \n\nfront  of  the  vehicle  and  when  vehicle  was  turned,  Zeshan  and  Arshad \n\nMehmood fired on  the  back  side of the  vehicle, which  landed  on  lower side of \n\nI \n\n\f2 \n\nCrl. Appeal No. 26/2015 \n\nhis  son in the  back  and  neck,  resultantly,  he  could  not  control  the  vehicle and \n\nthe  same  hit  the  tree,  whereupon,  his  wife and  son  were  also  injured.  The \n\ncomplaint  was  converted  into F.l.R Exh.PJ.  The injured  were taken  to hospital \n\nand  the  appellant's  son  was  treated  for his  injuries.  The Investigation  Officer \n\ntook the  fire empties  from the  place of occurrence.  Prepared  the  site plan  and \n\nalso took the  pictures  of the  vehicle bearing  registration  No. LXN-2973, Mehran \n\nwhite color driven by the  victim/injured  prosecution  witness  through  Exh.Pl  to \n\nExh.P7. The respondents  accused  were arrested  in  the  said  criminal  case  and \n\nafter  thorough \n\ninvestigation,  they  were  challaned \n\nin  this  case,  whereby \n\nprosecution  produced  11  witnesses,  and  after recording  the  statement  U / s 342 \n\nCr.P.C,  the \n\ntrial  Court  acquitted \n\nthe  accused/respondents \n\nfrom  the \n\nabovementioned criminal  case  through  the  impugned judgment. \n\n3.  Appellant in person  contends  that  learned  Trial Court  has  not  considered \n\nthe  testimony  of injured  PWs, who remained  consistent  and  unshaken  in  the \n\ncourse  of cross-examination;  that  all the  pieces  of evidence fully establish  the \n\nguilt  of  the  respondents  accused; \n\nthat  ocular  account  furnished  by  the \n\nprosecution  witnesses  has  been  discarded  due \n\nto  the  negligence  and \n\nmisconduct  of the  Investigation  Officers, who have neither  taken  the  vehicle in \n\ncustody  nor  produced  the  same  before the  Court.  Although  the  injured  Raja \n\nMuhammad  Safeer/PW-1  and  Mst. Sofia Iram/PW-2  have been  cross-examined \n\nat  length  and  they  have  explained  the  entire  incident  and  even identified the \n\nrespondents  accused  persons,  who are  known  to them.  The injuries  have been \n\ncorroborated  by  Dr.  Tanvir  Afsar/PW-7  and  the  Investigation  Officer has \n\nconfirmed the  involvement of respondents/  accused  persons,  but  learned  Trial \n\nCourt  has  taken  a  different  view on  assumptions,  hence  the  appeal  may  be \n\nallowed and  respondents  be  convicted for  the  heinous  crime  of  attempt  to \n\nmurder. \n\n4. \n\nConversely,  learned  Counsel  for  the  respondents  contends \n\nthat  no \n\nillegality has  been  observed  in the  trial, rather  prosecution  has  failed to justify \n\nthe  identification  of  the  accused  persons  and  the  alleged  incident  was  not \n\noccasioned  in  a  mode  and -  manner  referred  by  the  appellant,  rather  it  is  an \n\n\f3 \n\nCrl. Appeal No. 26/2015 \n\nattempt  of dacoity, which  has  been  converted  into  attempt  of murder  against \n\nthe  respondents  accused  persons,  due  to  enmity  between  the  parties.  He \n\nfurther  contends  that  eye-witness  /PW-2 has  taken  a different view and  version \n\nfrom Raja Muhammad  Safeer/PW-1,  which  was  made  basis  of the  acquittal  of \n\nthe \n\nrespondents, \n\neven  motive  has  not  been  established \n\nthrough  an \n\nindependent  means  and  as  such  the  entire  case  is  full of doubts,  especially \n\nwhen the  weapon  i.e. pistol was  not  recovered in this  case  during  the  course  of \n\ninvestigation. \n\n5.  Arguments  heard  and  record perused. \n\n6. \n\nPerusal  of record  reveals  that  the  appellant  had  lodged the  criminal  case \n\nF.l.R  No.  28,  dated  17.03.2012,  U/s  335/324/341/34 \n\nPPC,  P.S  Nilore, \n\nIslamabad  Exh.PJ  on  the  basis  of  his  complaint  Exh.PA on  the  date  of \n\noccurrence  i.e.  16.03.2012  with the  contention  that  his  son  Raja Muhammad \n\nSafeer took his  son  for medical  treatment  alongwith his  wife Mst. Sofia lram. \n\nAfter visiting Doctor, they  were on their  way back  to home  in their  vehicle. At \n\nabout  09:30  p.m,  the  moment  they  reached  on the  main  road  of Village Mohri, \n\nthey  noticed  that  someone  has  blocked their  way by placing  stone  and  bricks \n\non  the  road.

Tarnol, Islamabad. \n\nThrough  this Crl. Misc., petitioner  has  prayed  for \n\npost-arrest  bail in case FIR No.261, dated  08.05.2020, U /S \n\n364-A/34 PPC, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad. \n\n2. \n\nBrief facts referred  in the instant  FIR lodged  on the \n\ncomplaint  of  Mst.  Gui  Meena/respondent  No.2  are  that \n\non 08.05.2020 at about  10:45 a.m. she alongwith  her minor \n\nson namely  Bilal aged  about  11/12  years went  to Bhadana \n\nGraveyard  and  after visit of graveyard  at about  12:00 p.m. \n\nshe was looking for taxi and walking  on the road  when  all \n\nof sudden  four  persons  Sher  Rehman,  her  daughter  Mst. \n\nGui  Sehat  and  two  unknown  persons  armed  with  pistol \n\ncame,  who  abducted  the  son  of  complainant  in  Toyota \n\nCorolla  20D  blue  colour  car  and  fled  away  from  the \n\nscene. \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that \n\npetitioner  is innocent  and  has  falsely  been  implicated  in \n\nthis  case;  that  petitioner  has  business  dispute  with \n\n\fCrl.  Misc.  No.  830/B/2020 \n\n2 \n\nhusband  of  complainant;  that  investigation  has  been \n\ncompleted and  challan has been submitted  in the Court, \n\nwhereby  name  of  petitioner  has  been  mentioned  in \n\ncolumn No.2 of the challan; that  very registration of the \n\nFIR is based  upon  malafide as  husband  of complainant \n\ngot lodged different FIR for abduction of all of his family \n\nmembers against  different individuals  in  order  to  settle \n\nhis score which reflects the conduct of the family, which \n\namounts to abuse the legal process; that CDR collected by \n\nthe  1.0 reflects that  petitioner  was  not  available at  the \n\nplace of occurrence and no evidence is available on record \n\nto connect the petitioner with the alleged offence. \n\n4. \n\nConversely,  learned  State  Counsel  as  well  as \n\nlearned  counsel  for  complainant  contend  that  minor/ \n\nalleged  abductee  has  not  yet  been  recovered  and  even \n\nbusiness dispute has not been denied by petitioner's side; \n\nthat  offence with  which  petitioner  has  been  charged  is \n\nnon-bailable and falls with the ambit of prohibitory clause \n\nof Section 497 Cr.P.C. and as such petitioner has claimed \n\nransom  from  the  complainant  which  is  evident  from \n\nrecord, therefore, petitioner is not entitled for concession \n\nof bail. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments heard, record perused. \n\nThe  tentative  assessment  of  record  reveals  that \n\npetitioner  has  been  nominated  in  the  above  mentioned \n\nFIR  with  specific role  of  abduction  of  minor  son  of \n\ncomplainant aged about 11/12 years on 08.05.2020 in front \n\nof Bhadana Graveyard on gun point. \n\n\fCrl.  Misc.  No.  830/B/2020 \n\n3 \n\n7. \n\nCursory  glimpse  of record  reflects  that  petitioner \n\nwas  arrested  on  23.05.2020 and  remained  on  physical \n\nremand  for  12  days  but  nothing  incriminating  has  been \n\nrecovered  from  him,  even  it  is  not  consumable  to  a \n\nprudent  mind  that  an accused in order  to abduct  a person \n\nmay  seek  help  from  her  own  daughter  as  alleged  in  the \n\nFIR.  Investigation  has  been  completed  and  challan  has \n\nbeen  submitted  in the  Court,  whereby  name  of petitioner \n\nhas been referred  in column No.2  of the challan as there is \n\nno  direct  evidence  against  him  surfaced  on record  as per \n\nstance of LO. \n\n8. \n\nThe  history  of  complainant's  family  reveals  that \n\ndifferent  cases  have  been  registered  on  the  complaint  of \n\ncomplainant/respondent  No.2  or  on  behalf  of  her \n\nhusband  for her other family members,  whereby  all of her \n\nsons  and  daughters  were  abducted  in  different  criminal \n\ncases which  show  the  patron  of complainant's  side.  Such \n\ntrail  of different  cases  got  lodged  by  complainant  is also \n\nnot  considered  to  be  normal.  The  LO has  submitted  the \n\nfollowing  details  of  different  cases,  lodged  on  behalf  of \n\ncomplainant  or her husbands- \n\nFIR \nNo. \n51 \n\n287 \n\n676 \n\n492 \n\nAbductee \nName \nKamran \n\nDate \n\nUIS \n\nP.S. \n\n12.02.2014  365PPC \n\n23.04.2018  365PPC \n\nTarnol, \nIslamabad \nNasirabad,  Mst.

He  further  contended  that  the  act  of  the \n\nrespondents  is  against  the  principle  of  natural  justice; \n\nthat  no  evidence  is  available  with  the  respondents  to \n\ndeclare the petitioner and his family as Afghan Refugees. \n\n4. \n\nConversely, \n\nlearned  AAG  submits \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\npetitioner  applied \n\nfor \n\nissuance  of  CNIC  vide  TIO \n\nNo.504771027474  and  the  concerned  officer  of  the \n\nNADRA  recommended  for  verification  of  particulars  of \n\nthe  petitioner  through  Government  Agency  i.e  l.B,  vide \n\nletter  dated  02.12.2015  and \n\nit  was \n\nreported \n\nthat \n\npetitioner's  family  is  Afghan  National,  as  such,  a  show \n\ncause notice under Section  18  of the  NADRA Ordinance, \n\n2000  was  served  to  the  petitioner  and  his  family  to \n\nappear  before the  NADRA Verification  Board along with \n\nall documents,  but he failed  to  do  so,  as such,  he is  not \n\nentitled  for  any  discretionary  relief  and  this  petition  is \n\nliable to be dismissed. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments heard, record perused. \n\nPerusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the  petitioner \n\napplied for issuance of CNIC vide TIO No.504771027474 \n\nas \n\ntheir  previous  CNICs  were  expired. \n\nIt \n\nfurther \n\n\f3 \n\nW.P.  N0.361/2020 \n\ntranspires  from  the  record  that  the  NADRA  officer \n\nrecommended  the  case  of  the  petitioner  and  his  family \n\nfor  verification  of  their  particulars  through  Government \n\nAgency  vide  letter  dated  02.12.2015  and  after  due \n\nverification  it  was  reported  that  petitioner's  family  is \n\nAfghan  National.  Thereafter,  on  18.07.2017,  a  show \n\ncause  notice was  issued to  the  petitioner  and  his family, \n\nunder  Section  18  of \n\nthe  National  Database  and \n\nRegistration Authority  Ordinance,  2000 to  appear  before \n\nthe  NADRA Verification  Board along with  all documents, \n\nbut he did  not appear. Record further shows that father of \n\nthe  petitioner  earlier  filed  a  Writ  Petition  No.3760/2016 \n\nbefore  this  Court,  whereby  the  CNICs  of  the  petitioner \n\nfamily  were  temporarily  restored  but  their  case  was \n\nforwarded  to  the  Zonal  Office  Mirpur  in  the  light  of \n\nNotification  dated \n\n19.04.2017.  Despite \n\nrepeated \n\ntelephonic  calls, \n\nthe  petitioner \n\nfailed \n\nto \n\njoin \n\nthe \n\nproceedings  before  the  said  Board  for  redressal  of  his \n\ngrievance. \n\n7. \n\nFurthermore,  under  Section  18  of  the  National \n\nDatabase  and  Registration  Authority  Ordinance,  2000, \n\nthe  petitioner has alternate remedy of appeal against the \n\nfinal  order  of  the  respondents  before  the  Federal \n\nGovernment  but  the  petitioner  has  not  availed  the  said \n\nremedy.  When  confronted  with  the  above  alternate \n\nremedy available to the  petitioner,  at this stage,  learned \n\ncounsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that  he  would  be \n\nsatisfied  if  a  direction  is  issued  to  the  respondents  to \n\nprovide an  opportunity of hearing to the  petitioner at their \n\nZonal Office, Mirpur. \n\n8. \n\nThe  request  of  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner \n\nseems to be justified. Therefore, the petitioner is  directed \n\nto  appear  before  respondents  at  their  Zonal  Office \n\nMirpur,  within  two  weeks  from  today,  along  with  all  the \n\nrelevant  documents  and  copy  of \n\nthis  order, \n\nthe \n\nrespondents  shall  hear  the  petitioner  and  decide  the \n\nmatter  preferably  within  a  period  of  one  month  after \n\nreceipt of this order. \n\n\f4 \n\nW.P.  N0.361/2020 \n\n9. \n\nIn  view  of  the  above  direction,  this  petition  stands \n\ndisposed of. \n\nS.Akhtar",

N0.166-BC  /2020 \n\nagainst  respondents  1  &  2  is  of  abetment  which  falls \n\nunder section  109  PPC; that there  is  no evidence  on \n\nrecord  against  the  respondents; \n\nthat  the  accused/ \n\nrespondents did not misuse the concession of bail nor \n\ndid  they  ever  threatened  the  complainant  in  any \n\nmanner;  that  the  FIR  has  been  lodged  against  them \n\non  the  basis  of  false  and  baseless  allegations.  The \n\nlearned State Counsel opposed  the  contention  of the \n\nlearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  supported  the \n\nbail granting order passed by the learned Trial Court. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments heard, record perused. \n\nMinute  perusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the \n\ncomplainant  has  levelled  the  allegation  of  abetment \n\nagainst  the  respondents.  There  is  nothing  on  record \n\nto  show  that  in  whose  presence  the  abetment  was \n\nmade  by \n\nthe \n\nrespondents,  whereas  only \n\nthe \n\nstatement  of \n\nthe  complainant/petitioner \n\nis  not \n\nsufficient,  unless  there  is  strong  piece  of  evidence \n\navailable  on  record.

J :- Through this civil revision petition, the \n\npetitioner  has assailed the judgment  & decree dated 20.11.2009, passed by learned \n\nSenior Civil Judge, Islamabad and the judgment  & decree dated  I 9 .0I.2013,  passed \n\nby  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad,  whereby  suit  as  well  as  appeal \n\nfiled by the petitioner were dismissed concurrently. \n\n2. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  the  petitioner  filed  a  civil \n\nsuit  for  recovery  of Rs.I4,50,000/-  against  the  respondents,  which  was  dismissed \n\nwithout appreciating  the  evidence  available on record; that  respondent  No. I  is ex- \n\nfather in law of the petitioner,  whereas respondent No.2  is his brother  in law, who \n\nreceived  Rs.I4,50,000/-  as consideration to  arrange plot  in Islamabad  through  oral \n\nagreement  in presence  of Baber Hussain/P.W.2  and lbrar  Ahmed  P.W.3;  that both \n\nthe  Courts  below  have  not  considered  the  evidence  of P.Ws,  who  confirmed  the \n\nhanding  over  of the  payment  as  sale  consideration  alongwith  execution  of  oral \n\nagreement qua the plot. \n\n3. \n\nConversely, respondent No. I  in person contends that he is also representing \n\nrespondent No.2,  who  is his  real  son; that  the petitioner  is his  ex-son  in law, who \n\nfiled  false  and  frivolous  suit  to  exert  pressure  upon  them;  that  daughter  of the \n\npetitioner  filed  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  against  the  petitioner  and  the \n\npetitioner  in  order  to  counter  that  suit  filed  civil  suit  for  recovery  to  settle  family \n\nscore but  failed to  substantiate  legal grounds; that the petitioner  never  entered into \n\nagreement to sell nor received any amount; that both the Courts below have rightly \n\ndismissed claim of the petitioner. \n\n\fC.R  No. 77/2013. \n\n2 \n\n4. \n\n5. \n\nI have heard the arguments and perused the record. \n\nPerusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the  petitioner,  who  is  ex-son  in law  of \n\nrespondent  No.I  filed  suit  for  recovery  of  Rs.14,50,000/-  being  investment  in \n\nMarch,  2008  with  respondent  No. I  and  alleged  that  it  was  agreed  between  the \n\nparties that profit  will be  shared on 30% and  70% but despite the  commitment the \n\nplot  was  neither  arranged  nor  the  amount  was  returned.  The  respondents  have \n\ndenied the  oral  agreement  to  sell and  even  receiving  of the  amount  in the  written \n\nstatement. Learned  Trial  Court framed the  issues. The petitioner  himself  appeared \n\nas P.W.I  and reiterated  his  stance but  surprisingly he could not justify  his transfer \n\nof payment, even nothing was written amongst the parties nor any such document is \n\navailable on record.  The petitioner produced Baber Hussain as P.W.2, who has not \n\njustified  contents  of the  oral agreement between  the parties,  even he  is unaware of \n\nthe total  payment,  hence,  his  evidence  cannot be  considered  in terms  of  Qanun-e- \n\nShahadat Order,  I984.  Similarly, lbrar Ahmed/P.W.3 has also given vague evidence \n\nqua  the  oral  agreement  as  well  as  the  payment.  The  initial  onus  was  upon  the \n\npetitioner  in  terms  of  Article  I I 7  of  Qanun-Shahadat  Order,  I 984,  which  has  not \n\nbeen discharged in proper  manner. The entire case of the petitioner  discloses that it \n\nis counter blast to the  suit for dissolution of marriage filed by  Sadia ex-wife of the \n\npetitioner and real daughter of respondent No. I. \n\n6. \n\nI  have  gone  through  the  impugned judgments  of  Courts  below,  in which \n\neach  and  every  aspect  has  been  discussed  and  appreciated  in  proper  manner.  No \n\nillegality has been pointed  out by the petitioner and there is no jurisdictional  defect \n\nin the impugned judgments. \n\n7. \n\nIn  view  of  above  discussion,  the  instant  civil  revision  petition  bears  no \n\nmerits, therefore, the same is hereby dismissed. \n\nRAnjam",

Bhara  Kahu,\n\nIslamabad.\n\n2. \n\nBrief  facts referred  in the instant FIR registered\n\non the complaint  of Alamgir  Khan/respondent  No.2 are\n\nthat on 01,.07.201.9,  he was on duty  when he received  call\n\nfrom his home that some armed  personnel entered  into\n\nhis house, detained famity members and committed\n\ndacoity  in the house while snatched away  cash  amount\n\noI l1s.1,6,7O,OOOf -, gold jewelry,  purse, I.D card,  cheque\n\nbooks, etc.\n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel for the petitioner contends  that\n\npetitioner is innocent and  has falsely been implicated in\n\nthis case, even the recovered  amount  of Rs'50,000/-  and\n\npistol have been planted uPon the petitioner and no\n\nidentification  parade  has been  conducted  in this case as\n\nlady of complainant's  family identified  the petitioner in\n\n\fCrl.

The petitioner has\n\ntaken a specific  stance that he was identified  by the\n\nwoman fotk of the complainant's family  when  he was\n\nunder  treatment  in PIMS hospital as he was injured  in\n\nanother armed  robbery,  this aspect if considered at this\n\nstage would amount to deeper  appreciation, which  is\n\nnot permissible at bail stage.

No.72018/2020\n\n3\n\nsubmitted  in the Court and petitioner has been  charged\n\nwith the offence which falls within the ambit  of\n\nprohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C.

However,\n\nat this stage,  this Court will not interfere into those\n\norders as any observation at this stage might effect  the\n\ncase especially  when the challan  has already  been\n\nsubmitted  in the Court, therefore,  instant post-arrest  bail\n\napplication  is hereby  ilismissed.

Tarnol, Islamabad.\n\n2. \n\nBrief facts referred  in the instant FIR registered\n\non the complaint  of Usama  Naeem  Khan are that on\n\n07.10.2019 at about 03:15  p.m. three Persons  aged about\n\n25 to 40 years visited  his house in order to hire basement\n\nand posed  themselves as Government  servants. Thev\n\nagain  came  at about  04:15 p.m. to settle  the matter so\n\nthey called  them inside the house, one of them was\n\nbulky and wearing  black colour shalwar qarr.eez,\n\nsecond one was slim, wearing boski shalwar  qameez\n\nand third one was wearing blue colour clothes, as soon\n\nas they entered in the house they pointed their pistol\n\nand tide the complainant  and his family with rope  and\n\nsnatched 09  tola goid jewelry, cash amount\n\nRs.1,00,000/-,  MAC Laptop and fled au/?Y in their white\n\n\fCrl. Misc.  No.651/8/2020\n\n2\n\ncorolla  car having green  colour number plate.\n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel for the petitioner contends  that\n\npetitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated  in\n\nthis case,  even he has not been identified  by the\n\nwitnesses  of this case  during identification  parade;  that\n\ntotal recovery  in this case  is approximately Rs.4,00,000/-\n\nwhich is beyond the looted amount  as alleged  by the\n\ncomplainant  in the FIR and as such case falls within  the\n\nconcept  of further  inquiry; that mere pendency of other\n\ncriminal  cases  against the petitioner is no ground  to\n\nrefuse  the bail application.\n\n4. \n\nConversely,  learned State Counsel alongwith\n\ncomplainant contends that petitioner  has been identified\n\nduring the course of identification  parade with specific\n\nrole and he is also involved in other criminal cases of\n\nsimilar nature, therefore, he is  not entitled for\n\nconcession  of post-arrest bail.\n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments heard, record perused.\n\nTentative  assessment of record  reveals that\n\npetitioner has been involved in case FIR No.458,  dated\n\n07.10.2019,  U/S 392/411, PPC, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad\n\nwith the specific  role of comrnitting  armed  robbery.\n\n7. \n\nThe record  reflects that petitioner  was  arrested\n\non 27.10.20L9 and was identified during the course of\n\nidentification  parade  held on 15.11.20L9,  even challan\n\nhas been submitted in the Court on 24.12.2019  and\n\ncharge  has been framed  but due to Covid-L9  pandemic\n\ntrial is not in progress.  Rs.1,00,000/-  and four gold\n\n\fCrl. Misc.

The police  record  reflects\n\nthat 19 other  criminal cases of armed robbery  have been\n\nregistered  against the petitioner,  whereas  L0 cases are\n\nfrom Islamabad jurisdiction.  I.O states that petitioner\n\nwas convicted in some  of the cases but record is not yet\n\navailable.\n\n8. \n\nThe entire background of the case reflects that\n\npetitioner  is hardened and desperate  criminal involved\n\nin number  of cases, although  pendency  of cases is no\n\nground  for refusal  of bail as highlighted  in 2070yLR624",

The  case  of  the \n\npresent  petitioner  is  at  par  with  the  co-accused.  The  only  allegation \n\nagainst  the  present  petitioner  is  that  he  was  accompanying  the  main \n\naccused  and  they  were  arrested  at  the  crime  scene.  Perusal  of  record \n\ndoes  not  show  that  the  number/sim  used  for  sending  the  objectionable \n\npictures  and  messages  was  in  the  name  of  the  petitioner  or  in  his  use. \n\nInvestigation  against  the  petitioner  has  been  completed  and  further \n\nincarceration of  the  latter  will  not serve any  useful purpose. Report under \n\nsection  173  of  Cr.P.C.  has  been submitted  before the  learned trial  Court. \n\nThe  main  accused  has  been  declared  as  innocent.  Whether  or  not  the \n\noffences  mentioned  in  the  FIR  are attracted  to  the  extent  of  the  present \n\npetitioner  needs  further  probe.  Deeper appreciation  of  evidence  at  bail \n\nstage is  not  permissible. The  petitioner  does not  have a  criminal  record. \n\nThe continued custody of the  petitioner is  not likely to  serve any beneficial \n\npurpose at  this  stage.  Nothing has  been  placed  on  record to  indicate that \n\nthe  petitioner  may  abscond  if  he  is  released  on  bail.  This  Court  is, \n\ntherefore,  of  the  opinion  that  the  petitioner  is  entitled  to  be  released  by \n\nextending the concession of bail. \n\n\f-4- \n\nCrl.  Misc.  No.  152-B  of  2020. \n\n6. \n\nIt  has  been aptly  observed by the  august Supreme Court in \n\nthe  case  of  ''Manzoor and 04 others  VS  The State\"reported  as  [PLO  1972 \n\nS.C.  81]  as  follows: \n\n\"The ultimate  conviction and  incarceration  of a guilty \n\nperson  can repair  the  wrong  caused by  a  mistaken  relief  of \n\ninterim  bail  granted  to  him,  but  no  satisfactory  reparation \n\ncan  be  offered  to  an  innocent  man  for  his  unjustified \n\nincarceration at any  stage of the  case albeit  his acquittal  in \n\nthe long nm: \n\nIn  the  light  of  the  facts  and  circumstances of  the  present \n\ncase,  refusal of  bail  will tantamount  to  punishing the  petitioner. \n\n7. \n\nIn  the  circumstances as  mentioned  above,  this  petition  is \n\nallowedand  the  petitioner  is  admittedto  bail, subject to  furnishing  bail \n\nbonds in  the  sum  of  Rs.2.00.0001- (Rupees two  hundred thousand  only)",

We have  heard  that  arguments  of the  learned  counsel  for the \n\nparties and have gone through the available record. \n\n7. \n\nThe  record  transpires  that  on  16.09.2019,  a  mobile  phone \n\nbearing I.M.E.I No.4496091204513 was recovered on the pointation of \n\nco-accused  Ibrar  Ahmedand  different  SIM  numbers  have  also  been \n\nrecovered \n\nfrom  accused  Murtaza  Ali  and  allegedly  from  the \n\n\f3 \n\nCrl.Misc.No.43-B/2020 \n\npetitionerwith  the  allegation that  threatening  calls were  received  for \n\nthe  demand  of \"Bhatta\",  Section 506 P.P.C  and Section 25-D Telegraph \n\nAct are  bailable in nature  while punishment  provided  for Section 387 \n\nP.P.C does not fall within the prohibitory clause of 497 Cr.P.C. \n\n8. \n\nPerusal  of  the \n\nrecord \n\nreveals \n\nthat \n\nthe  only  piece  of \n\nevidenceavailable  on  record  is  Call  Data Record. The  messages  have \n\nbeen notified which have been conveyed through  an unknown number \n\nbut  it is yet to be determined  as to how and when the  messages were \n\nconveyed. The petitioner  is  no  more  required  to  the  prosecution  for \n\nany probe, challan has already been submitted  and the trial is at initial \n\nstage. Deeper appreciation  at bail stage is not permissible  and we are \n\nrequired  to  make  tentative  assessment  of the  evidence  available on \n\nrecord.Guilt of the  petitioner  is yet  to  be  determined  by the  learned \n\nTrial  Court after  recording  of prosecution  evidence. As  such, case  of \n\npetitioner  falls within ambit of further  inquiry in terms  of Section 497",

Today  neither  complainant  nor  his  counsel  nor \n\nany intimation has been received on his behalf. Therefore,  \n\nthis  Court    is  left  with  no  other  option,  but  to  decide  the \n\ncase after hearing learned counsel for the petitioner, learned \n\nState counsel and by perusing the record.   \n\n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nCR.MISC. NO.817 /2019 \n\n6. \n\n7. \n\nArguments heard, record perused. \n\nBriefly, the instant case has been registered against \n\nthe  petitioner,  his  mother  and  two  un-known  persons \n\nstating  therein  that  on  30.12.2018  at  about  10.00  AM,  his \n\nsister was abducted by the petitioner and his mother namely \n\nFozia  Shahid  and  they  also  took  away  10-tolas  gold \n\nornaments and an amount of Rs 1,00,000/- cash. \n\n8. \n\nTentative  assessment  of  the  record  shows  that \n\npetitioner \n\nis  behind \n\nthe  bar  since  13.2.2019, \n\nthe \n\ninvestigation  of  the  case  is  complete,  report  under  section \n\n173  Cr.P.C  has  been  submitted  in  the  Trial  Court.  No \n\nuseful  purpose  would  be  served  to  keep  the  petitioner \n\nbehind  the  bar  for  an  indefinite  period.  It  is  common \n\npractice  in  our  society  that  parents  of  the  girl  involve  the \n\nboy and his family members in the abduction case of their \n\ndaughter  due  to  grudge  that  their  daughter  had  contracted \n\nlove marriage without their consent.  \n\n9. \n\nOn 13.2.2019, the couple was arrested by the police \n\nand  on  the  very  day  she  got  recorded  her  statement  under \n\nsection 161 Cr.P.C wherein she clearly stated that she had \n\ncontracted  marriage  with  Muhammad  Shoaib  Malik  at  her \n\nown and that she had not been abducted. She further stated \n\nthat no one abducted her and her brother had lodged a false, \n\nbaseless  and  a  concocted  case  against  the  petitioner  and \n\nothers.  Thereafter,  the  police  of  Police  Station  Charsadda \n\nproduced \n\nthe  alleged  abductee  before \n\nthe  Judicial \n\nMagistrate,  Charsadda  wherein  she  also  got  recorded  her \n\nstatement, which is placed on record, that she had not been \n\nabducted  which  makes  the  case  of  the  petitioner  one  of \n\nfurther inquiry.  \n\n10. \n\nIn  the  backdrop  of  the  above  narrated  facts  and \n\ncircumstances,  it  seems  that  a  matrimonial  issue  is  being \n\ntransformed  into  a  criminal  case  by  the  complainant  to \n\nsatisfy  his  vengeance.  The  question  whether \n\nthe \n\nabductee/victim  has  actually  been  abducted  by \n\nthe \n\npetitioner  or  she  has  herself  left  the  house  of  her  parents \n\nand  contracted  marriage  with  the  petitioner,  shall  be \n\ndetermined  by  the  learned  Trial  Court  after  recording  of \n\nevidence.  \n\n \n \n\f3 \n\nCR.MISC. NO.817 /2019 \n\n11. \n\nFor  what  has  been  discussed  above,  the  case  of \n\npetitioner  prima  facie,  becomes  that  of  further  inquiry \n\ncovered  by  subsection",

Hence the instant petition. \n\n3. \n\nThe  learned  counsel for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that; \n\nallegations  against  the  latter  are  false,  frivolous  and  vexatious;  the \n\npetitioner  has  been  falsely  involved  in  the  instant  case just  to  harass, \n\npressurize and  blackmail  him;  the  offences are  not  attracted  against the \n\npetitioner;  the  petitioner  has  not committed  the  alleged offences;  medical \n\n.exarnlnatlon  of  the  petitioner  was  not  conducted  so  as  to  attract  the \n\n\f-2- \n\nCrl. Misc. No. 794-B  of 2019. \n\noffences  under  sections  377  of  PPC  and  22  of  PECA;  no  incriminating \n\nmaterial was recovered from  the  petitioner and at the  most section 109  of \n\nPPC  is  attracted  against the  present petitioner;  the  petitioner  was  driving \n\nthe  vehicle  of  the  co-accused; the  petitioner  has  not  used  an  electronic \n\ndevice by transmitting  explicit  material  relating  to  the  complainant;  there \n\nis  no  allegation  that  the  present  petitioner  has  used  his  personal cellular \n\nphone  for  transmitting  or  sending  explicit  material  to  another  person; \n\ninvestigations qua the  petitioner  have been completed and he is  no  more \n\nrequired for the  purposes thereof;  the  petitioner  has  been incarcerated for \n\nmore than  six months; further  incarceration of the  petitioner  will  not serve \n\nany  useful  purpose;  recovery if  any  is  fake  and concocted; the  petitioner \n\nis  previously  non-convict  and  non-record  holder;  there  is  no  chance of \n\nabscondance of the  petitioner  or tampering with  the  prosecution evidence; \n\nthe  case  against the  petitioner  is  based  on  malafide and  ulterior  motives \n\nof the complainant;  the  offences do not fall within  the ambit of  prohibitory \n\nclause of  section 497  of  Cr.P.C.;  report  under  section  173  of  Cr.P.C.  has \n\nbeen  submitted  before  the  learned  trial  Court;  the  case  against  the \n\npetitioner  is  that  of further  probe; the story as  narrated in  the  FIR is false, \n\nfrivolous  and  baseless; hence the  learned counsel urges the  petitioner  to \n\nbe  released on bail. \n\n4. \n\nThe  learned  Deputy  Attorney  General  appeared  alongwith \n\nFazal  Maabood S.I.  FIA.  They  have  contended  that;  recovery  has  been \n\naffected \n\nfrom \n\nthe  petitioner; \n\nthe  petitioner  has  been  specifically \n\nnominated  in  the  FIR;  the  petitioner  has  deliberately  uploaded  personal \n\nand  objectionable  pictures  of  the  complainant;  the  said  act  of  the \n\npetitioner  has  destroyed the  honour and  modesty of  the  complainant  not \n\nonly  in  family  but  also in  the  community;  investigations qua the  petitioner \n\n\f-3- \n\nCrl.  Misc.  No.  794-B  of 2019. \n\nhave  been completed  and  report  under  section  173 of  Cr.P.C.  has  been \n\nsubmitted  before  the  learned  trial  Court;  the  trial  of  the  case  will  be \n\nconcluded shortly;  hence urges for dismissal of bail. \n\n5. \n\nThe  allegation against the  present petitioner  is  to  the  extent \n\nthat  he was accompanying another  person who is  the  main accused in  the \n\ncase in  hand. There  is  nothing  on  record to  show that  the  number  used \n\nfor  sending the  objectionable  pictures and  messages was  in  the  name of \n\nthe  petitioner  or  in  his  use.  Furthermore, the  present petitioner  is  not the \n\nmain accused. Investigations  qua the  petitioner  have been completed and \n\nfurther  incarceration of the  latter will  not serve any useful purpose. Report \n\nunder  section  173 of  Cr.P.C.  has been submitted  before the  learned trial \n\nCourt. Whether  or  not  the  offences mentioned in  the  FIR are attracted  to \n\nthe  extent  of  the  petitioner  needs further  probe.  Deeper appreciation  of \n\nevidence at  this  stage  is  not  permissible. The  petitioner  does not  have a \n\ncriminal record.  His  continued custody is  not  likely to  serve any  beneficial \n\npurpose at  this  stage.  Nothing has been placed on  record to  indicate that \n\nthe  petitioner  may  abscond  if  he  is  released  on  bail.  This  Court  is, \n\ntherefore,  of  the  opinion  that  the  petitioner  is  entitled  to  be  released by \n\nextending the concession of  bail. \n\n6. \n\nIt  has been aptly  observed by the  august  Supreme Court in \n\nthe  case of  ''Manzoor and  04  others  VSThe  State\"  reported  as  [PLD \n\n1972 S.C.  81]  as follows: \n\n\"The ultimate  conviction and  incarceration  of a guilty \n\nperson  can repair  the  wrong caused by  a  mistaken  relief of \n\ninterim  bail  granted  to  him,  but  no  satisfactory  reparation \n\n\f-4- \n\nCrl. Misc. No. 794-B  of 2019. \n\ncan  be  offered  to  an  innocent man  for  his  unjustified \n\nincarceration at any stage of the case albeit his acquittal in \n\nthe long nm\": \n\nIn  the  light  of  the  facts  and  circumstances of  the  present \n\ncase,  refusal of  bail  will tantamount  to  punishing the  petitioners. \n\n7. \n\nIn  the  circumstances as  mentioned  above,  this  petition  is \n\nallowed and the  petitioner  is  admitted to  bail, subject to  furnishing  bail \n\nbonds in  the  sum  of  Rs.20,00,0001-  (Rupees two  million  only)",

J.  -  Through  the  instant  petition,  the  petitioner \n\nhas  challenged order  dated  29.10.2019,  whereby  the  learned Trial  Court  fixed \n\nthe interim  maintenance as  Rs.25,000/- per minor per month. \n\n2. \n\nThe  facts,  in  brief,  are  that  respondents  No.1  to  3  filed  a  suit  for \n\nmaintenance and  recovery  of  dower  through  respondent  No.4.  In  the  referred \n\nsuit,  application  for  interim  maintenance was  also filed  in  which  the  order  has \n\nbeen passed, whereby  the  interim  maintenance has  been fixed  as  Rs.25,000/- \n\nper month per child. \n\n3. \n\nLearned counsel for  the  petitioner,  inter-alia,  contended that  suit has \n\nbeen filed  incompetently as  it  has  been done so on behalf of  respondents No.1 to \n\n3  through  respondent  No.4.  It  was  contended  that  the  power  of  attorney \n\nappended with  the  suit  clearly  shows that  it  is  only  for  a  specific property  and \n\n\f-2- \n\nWrit Petition No.4039of2019 \n\nnot for  filing  the  instant  suit.  It  was further  submitted  that  under the  facts and \n\ncircumstances the fixation  of the  interim  maintenance is  arbitrary  and excessive. \n\n4. \n\nLearned counsel for  respondents No.1  to  4,  inter-alia, contended that \n\nfresh  power  of  attorney  has  been  executed  by  respondent  No.1, who  filed  the \n\nsuit  on  behalf  of  respondents  No.2  and  3  as  they  are  minors,  through  her \n\nattorney  respondent  No.4.  It  was submitted that  in  the  latter  power of  attorney \n\nthe  filing  of  the  suit  on the  basis  of  earlier power of  attorney  has  been  rectified, \n\nhence there  is  no lacuna as  such.  It was further  contended that  in  the  facts and \n\ncircumstances sum of  Rs.25,000/- as  interim  maintenance is  appropriate. \n\n5. \n\nArguments  advanced by  learned counsel for  the  parties  have  been \n\nheard and the documents placed on record examined with  their able assistance. \n\n6. \n\nThe petitioner  has  not substantiated his  plea  regarding the fixation of \n\nthe \n\ninterim  maintenance  as  excessive  or  not  tenable \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nfacts  and \n\ncircumstances.  It  is  trite  law  that  an  interim  order  cannot  be  interfered  with \n\nunless  it  is  without  jurisdiction  or  patently  illegal.  In  any  case,  the  fixation  of \n\ninterim  maintenance is  tentative  and can  always be  varied  by  the  learned Trial \n\nCourt  upon  conclusion  of  the  trial.  In  so  far  as  objection  of  the  petitioner \n\nregarding  the  maintainability  of  the  suit  is  concerned,  learned  counsel  for \n\nrespondents No.1  to 4 categorically submitted that  a  fresh  power of attorney  has \n\nbeen  submitted  in  which  filling  of  the  suit  has  been  rectified  and  respondent \n\nNo.4  has  specific  authorization \n\nto  pursue  the  suit. \n\nIn \n\nthe \n\nfacts  and \n\ncircumstances, the  impugned  order  does  not  warrant  interference  as  there  is \n\nnothing on record to  establish that  there  was no  jurisdiction  to  pass  the order  in \n\nquestion or the  same was done in  violation of any law. \n\n7. \n\nFor  what  has  been  stated above, the  instant  petition  is  without  merit \n\nand  is  accordingly  dismissed,  however,  the  learned Trial  Court  is  directed  to \n\n\f-3- \n\nWrit Petition No.4039of2019 \n\ndeal with  the  objection  regarding the  maintainability  of  the  suit  as a  preliminary \n\none. \n\n*M.

Brief  facts referred in the instaOt F.I.R  lodged on\n\nthe complaint of Muhammad Asif/respondent  No.2\n\nare that he is  serving in  Pakistan  Army and on\n\n24.09.2019,  he received a call that hils wife Mst. Abida\n\nBibi alongwith  two minor children  are missing from\n\nhis house,  complainant's  brother ialso verified the\n\nmissing  Mst. Abida Bibi from her parents house, but\n\nshe was not with her parents, thereafter  Shakeel,\n\nresident  of Ahmad Pur Sial, Tehsil  Jhang and his\n\nrelative Wajid were nominated  in\n\ncase.\n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel for the peti\n\ncontends that\n\npetitioner is not nominated  as\n\nsed in this case\n\nnor any role has been attributed re\n\nenticement\n\nand abduction of Mst. Abida Bibi.\n\nfurther contends\n\nthat Mst. Abida  Bibi has filed application before the\n\n\f2\n\nCtl. Misc.  No.785/B/2019\n\nlearned Judicial  Magistrate,  Section 30, Ahmad Pur\n\nSial on 03. 10.2019 and recorded  her statement,\n\nwhereafter she was sent to Danulamah  to provide  her\n\nsecurity. He further contends that  the  alleged\n\nabductee  has filed suit for dissolutlon of marriage\n\nagainst  Muhammad Asif/complainant  on 08.09.2019\n\nbefore learned Judge  Family Court, Ahmad  Pur Sial\n\nprior to the alleged date of occurrence  and as such it\n\nis  a  case of further inquiry and any subsequent\n\nstatement  U/s 164 Cr.P.C recorded at Islamabad  has\n\nno legal worth to consider  the same  against the\n\npresent  petitioner. It has lastly been contended  that\n\nthe challan  has been submitted  before  the Court and\n\npetitioner is no more required for the purpose of\n\ninvestigation, hence entitled for concession of post\n\narrest bail.\n\n4.  Conversely, Complainant in  person stated\n\nbefore  the Court that his counsel is not available and\n\nrequests for adjournment,  which has been turned\n\ndown as it is the 4th date of hearinrg of instant post\n\narrest bail, therefore,  learned State Counsel is\n\ndirected to argue the case.\n\n5. \n\nLearned State Counsel contends that although\n\nthe petitioner is not directly  noming.ted in this case,\n\nbut when the alleged abductee  whs recovered  and\n\ncame to Islamabad and recorded\n\nhler statement U/s\n\nL64 Cr.P.C. on 29.tO.2OL9,  she\n\nIhas ascribed the\n\ncomplete  role of petitioner, in which  she alleges that\n\npetitioner abducted  her in conni\n\nvaric\n\ne with the other\n\nco-accused  persons, who have\n\nl\n\nbbe\n\nn  granted post\n\narrest bail in this case. It has lastly been contended\n\n\fI\n\n3\n\ndl. Misc,  No.785lBl2019\n\nthat the alleged  abductee has recorded her statement\n\nU/s  L64 Cr.P.C and such statemeflt  could not be\n\nconsidered on the lighter side at the bail stage, which\n\nprima  face connects the petitioner  with the alleged\n\ncrime of enticement and abduction.\n\n6.  Arguments  heard, record perused.\n\n7.  Perusal of record  reveals  that the lady namely\n\nAbida Bibi  was allegedly  enticed away by  the\n\nnominated  accused namely Shakpel and  Wajid\n\nreferred  in FIR No. 452/L9, dated 2+.O9.2O19,  U/S\n\n496-A PPC,  P.S Bara Kahu,  Islamabdd lodged on the\n\ncomplaint of  Muhammad  Asif/ COmplainant, the\n\nhusband  of Abida Bibi.\n\n8.  The tentative assessment  of record reflects  that\n\nthe alleged abductee was missing  from his abode on\n\n24.09.2019. She has filed suit fon dissolution  of\n\nmarriage tttled lEst. Abtda Blbt VS ltuhammad Astf\non 28.09.2OL9  before learned  Family Judge,  Ahmed\n\nPur Sial and same is pending adjudication  and in\n\naddition  to the said suit, the applicattion  was also filed\n\nby the said abductee on 03.1O.2O19 before the lllaqa\n\nMagistrate,  Ahmed  Pur Sial, District Jhang,  in which\n\nshe has referred the conduct  of complainant/her\n\nhusband  Muhammad  Asif, the said application was\n\nallowed  by the concerned Magistra[e,  who recorded\n\nthe statement  of alleged  abductee orfi OS. lO.2O19 and\n\nsent her to  Darulaman alongwithl two minors for\n\nprotection  of life from her husband  ]i.e. Complainant.\nWhen the alleged  abductee wasbrouf,ht to Islamabad,\n\nshe again recorded her statement  Uf s 16a Cr.P.C.  on\n\n29.LO.2019 and  ascribed the  r]ole of  Shakeel,\n\n\f4\n\nChl. Misc.  No.785/B/2019\n\nShaukat,  Wajid and Umer Hayat/pfeset petitioner,\n\nwho have allegedly  abducted her on gunpoint.\n\n9.  The above referred position clearly shows that\n\ntwo contradictory  stances have been recorded  by the\n\nalleged  abductee before two different  Magistrates,\n\nwhich are available  on record, wherefy  in the earlier\n\nstatement, she has not  uttered a  single word\n\nregarding her abduction rather she was seeking\n\nprotection  from her husband and in  the second\n\nstatement, she has taken a somersiult  and alleged\n\nthe commission  of offence  against the petitioner  as\n\nwell as to others\n\n10.  Besides the  above referred position,  the\n\nco-accused nominated through  supplementary\n\nstatement in  this  case namely  Shaukat  Ali,\n\nMuhammad  Tanveer have been  grarnted post arrest\n\nbail by the concerned Illaqa Magistrate and as such\n\nrule of consistency  is applicable in this case.  The\n\nChallan  has been submitted  before the Court on\n\n16.11 .2019, however, charge has not flet been framed.\n\nThe element of enticement  is not visible and even the\n\nsuit for dissolution  of marriage reflects  the conduct of\n\ncomplainant,  whereby all these factors establish  the\n\ncase as of further inquiry in terms of Section  a97Ql\n\nCr.P.C, even otherwise, the effect gf two different\nstatements  of  alleged abductee fecorded  before\n\ndifferent Courts have to be evalua\n\nat the time of\n\ntrial in evidence,  therefore,  petitio\n\nis entitled for\n\nconcession  of post arrest  bail, who is\n\nently behind\n\nthe bars with no useful purpose.\n\n\f5\n\nCrl.

For what has been discussed  afoove, the instant\n\npetition  is alloued,  and the petitioner is admitted  to\n\npost arrest bail subject  to his furnishing of bail bonds\n\nin the sum of Rs.100,0OO/-  with one $urety in the like\n\namount to the satisfaction  of learned  frial.Court.\n\n(MOHSIN AKHTAR KIYANI)",

The facts, in brief, are that respondents\nfiled a  suit for maintenance against  the\npetitioner in which the interim  maintenance\n\nwas initially fixed as Rs. 4OO0l- per child on\n\nL0.02.20t7;  subsequently,  respondent  No.2\n\nfixed the same  as Rs. 2O,00O/- which  has been\nassailed vide order dated 29.04.20L9.\n\nApparently the petitioner  assailed order dated\n\n29.04.20L9 before the Appellate Court  i.e.\n\nrespondent  No.3, which  as per learned counsel\n\nfor the petitioner  was dismissed  as withdrawn.\n3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter\n\nalia, contended  that interim maintenance has\n\nbeen re-fixed by the learned Trial Couft\n\nwithout any justification  or basis; that the\n\n\f2\n\nW.P No. 3541  of 2019\n\npetitioner was not heard before the re-fixation;\n\nthat the petitioner is paying Rs. 12000/- per\n\nmonth as ordered  by the learned  Trial Couft.\n4.  Arguments  advanced by the learned\n\ncounsel  for the petitioner  have been heard and\n\nthe documents placed on record examined with\n\nhis able assistance.\n5. \n\nIt is trite law that a petition  under Afticle\n\n199 of the Constitution is not maintainable\n\nagainst an interim order unless the same is\n\nwithout jurisdiction  or is patently illega!. Under\n\nsection L7 of the Family Courts Act, 1964,  the\nFamily  Court seized of  the matter is\nempowered  to fix the interim maintenance,\nwhich is  adjusted at  the time of  final\n\nadjudication. The learned Trial Court has\nexercised the referred  jurisdiction by re-\n\nfixation of the maintenance.  Learned  counsel\nfor the petitioner  failed to point out any\n\nillegality or jurisdlctional error on paft of the\n\nlearned Trial Court.\n6.  For what has been stated above,  the\ninstant petition is  without merit and  is\n\ndismissed  in limine.\n\n*ShakdAhal*",

The facts, in brief, are that petitioner\nNo.1 and the respondent  got married on\n\n11.04.1999.  Out of the wedlock  four children\n\nwere born. Differences  arose between  the\n\nspouses,  which culminated into divorce on\n\n02.L1.2013.  Respondent No.1 filed a petition\n\nunder Section  25 of Guardian  and Wards Act,\n\n1890, which was decided on L4.04.2015. The\n\nConstitutional petition was filed i.e. CP No.\n1686/2015 in  this Court assailing the\n\njudgments  dated t4.04.2015  and 14.05.2015\nwhich was allowed and the matter was\n\nremanded  to the Guardian  Court for decision\non  the  question of  jurisdiction.  On\n\n\fW.P  No.4l68  of 2017\n\na\n\n0t.02.20L7, respondent No.3 decided the\n\nmatter  on merit after deciding the question  of\n\njurisdiction  on 2L.06.2017.  On 27.03.20L7 an\n\nappeal was filed which was dismissed  on\n\n20.t0.20L7  as being barred by limitation,\n\nhence the petition.\n3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter\nalia, contended that since the order in\nquestion is not sustainable,  hence be set\n\naside. It was submitted that the delay, if any,\n\nwas required to be condoned.\n4.  Learned counsel for respondent  No.1,\n\ninter alia, contended that the appeal preferred\n\nwas barred by limitation, hence was rightly\n\ndismissed.\n5.  Arguments  heard,  record perused.\n6.  As noted above, the learned trial Court\ndecided the application  under Section  25 of\n\nGuardian  and Wards Act, 1890 on 01 .02.20L7.\n\nThe appellants applied for certified copy of the\n\nsaid order on 27.03.20L7  and filed it on the\n\nsame day.

Sheraz Sohail, Advocate for the petitioner.\n\nOrder  with signature of Judge  and  that of parties or counsel\nwhere necessary.\n\nThrough the instant writ petition, the\npetitioner,  Javid lqbal Omer alias Omer Hayat,\nimpugns  the judgment  dated '17.O7.2O19,  passed\nby the Court of the learned Additional District\nJudge,  lslamabad, whereby  his appeal against the\norder  dated  06.04.2019, passed by the learned\nFamily Gourt, was dismissed.  Vide the said order\ndated 06.04.2019,  the learned Family Court had\nclosed the petitioner's right to file a written\nstatement to the amended  plaint.\n2.  Learned counsel for  the  petitioner\nsubmitted that the petitioner  had already  filed his\nwritten  statement on 29.10.2018;  that earlier the\nex-parte proceedings  against the petitioner  were\nset-aside,  vide order dated 17.'1O.2O18 subject to\nthe payment of costs; that on 06.04.2019, the\npetitioner  had paid costs of Rs.5,000/-;  that after\nthe payment of costs, the learned  Trial Court\nshould not have struck  off the petitioner's right to\nfile a written statement to the amended plaint; and\nthat the learned  Appellate Court erred by holding\nthat the petitioner  had tried to prolong  the\nlitigation  and had abused the process of the\nCourt.  Learned counsel  for the petitioner prayed\nfor the writ petition to be allowed  and for the\nconcurrent orders/judgments  passed by the\nlearned Courts below to be set-aside.\n\n\f2\n\nW.P. No.327712019\n\n3. \nI have heard  the contentions  of the learned\ncounse!  for the petitioner  and have perused the\nrecord with his able assistance.\n4.  The petitioner  has chosen not to file a copy\nof the suit for recovery of maintenanee,  etc. filed\nby respondents No.1 and 2 against the petitioner\nbefore the learned Family Court. The documents\non the record show that vide order dated\n26.06.2018,  the petitioner  was proceeded against\nex-parte  by the learned Family Court.  Vide order\ndated 17.'1O.2018, the petitioner's  application  for\nsetting-aside the ex-parte proceedings  was\nallowed subject to  the payment of  costs\namounting to Rs.3,000/-.  The petitioner was also\ndirected to file the amended written statement.\nOn 29.'10.2018, the petitioner filed the written\nstatement but did not pay the costs. The\npetitioner was directed to pay the costs as well as\nthe outstanding maintenance  allowance for the\nminor,  failing  which his defence was to be struck\noff under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan\nFamily Courts Act,  1 964. On 19.11 .2018, the\npetitioner sought an  adjournment for  an\nopportunity to pay costs. On 27.1',.2018, the\npetitioner was given a last and final opportunity to\npay the costs. Since  the petitioner  did not pay the\ncosts, the learned Family Court, vide order  dated\n04.12.2018,  recalled its order dated  17.10.2018,\nwhereby  the ex-parte proceedings  had been set-\naside. The matter was adjourned  on 13.'12.20118\nand 10.01.2019.  On the latter date, the matter was\n\nadjourned  to 28.0 1 .2019.\n5.  The petitioner  has chosen not to file copies\nof the order dated 28.O1t.2019 and the subsequent\norders upto 21.03.2019.  Vide order dated\n06.04.2019, the petitioner is said to have paid\ncosts amounting to Rs.5,000/-. However, the\n\n\f3\n\nW.P. No.327712019\n\nlearned Family Court struck off the petitioner's\nright to file a written statement  to the amended\nplaint. The said order dated 06.04.2019 was\nassailed  by the petitioner  in an appea! before the\nCourt of the learned Additional District  Judge,\nfslamabad.  Vide judgment dated 17.07.2019, the\nsaid appeal  was dismissed.\n6.  Perusal  of the judgment dated 17.07.2019,\npassed  by the tearned  Appellate Court shows that\nthe petitioner  had not bothered to pay the interim\nmaintenance  for his minor son after filing the\nappeat.  Several  opportunities had been  given by\nthe learned Appellate  Court to the petitioner's\ncounsel to argue the appeal, but to no avail.\nHaving gone through the appellate judgment\ndated  17.07.2019,  I do not find any jurisdictional\ninfirmity in the same so as to warrant  interference\nin the Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.\n7.  Even otherwise, the petitioner's  appeal\nagainst the order dated 06.04.2019 was not\nmaintainable.  The said order dated  06.04.2019\nwas an interim order.\n\nSection 14",

Misc.  No.421lB/2019\n\n2\n\nRawal Dam and his missing  vehicle was also recovered\n\nfrom Rawalpindi;  that present petitioner was nominated\n\nin this case through supplementary  statement dated\n\n01.03.2018 and she was forced to record her statement\n\nU /51,64 Cr.P.C.  after  snatching  her minor suckling child\n\nand as a result  whereof she was allegedly involved\n\nthrough the said confessional  statement  by the police as\n\nwell as by the complainanU  that petitioner is behind  the\n\nbars since 11.03.2018  and trial has not yet been\n\nconcluded,  whereby she is claiming  post arrest bail on\n\nmerit as well as on the ground  of statutory  delay.\n\n4. \n\nConversely,learned  counsel for the complainant\n\nas well as learned State Counsel contend that petitioner\n\nis nominated  through supplementary  statement  and she\n\nhas recorded her inculpatory  statement in which  entire\n\nincident of murder  of Raja Yasir has been explained\n\nwith the help of co-accused  of the petitioner in a planed\n\nmanner;  that the delay in the conclusion  of trial is not\n\nattributed to the prosecution and the trial Court has\n\nalready  recorded  evidence of 06 prosecution  witnesses\n\nand there  is likelihood  of conclusion of trial within  next\n\n45 days after  summer  vacations.\n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nArguments  heard, record perused.\n\nFrom the tentative assessment of record, it\n\nreveals that petitioner  has been nominated in criminal\n\ncase  FIR  No.63, dated  22.02.2018,  U /S\n\n302/365/392/411,/201,/34 PPC, P.S. Lohi  Bher,\n\nIslamabad  through supplementary statement  recorded\n\n\fCrl. Misc.  No.42UBl2019\n\n3\n\non 01.03.2018. The petitioner is wife of deceased  Raja\n\nYasir Murtaza who was murdered  by co-accused\n\nnominated in this case, however,  petitioner /wife of\n\ndeceased  got recorded  her confessional statement U/S\n\n164 Cr.P.C.  in which she has explained  the relationship\n\nwith co-accused Shahid, with whom  she has allegedly\n\nplanned the murder of deceased.\n\n7. \n\nCursory  glimpse of record  reveals that co-\n\naccused Shahid  and Waseem visited the house of\n\npetitioner  in  the late night with  pre-planned\n\narrangement  and they  kidnaPPed  Raja  Yasir Murtaza  on\n\ngunpoint and took him on his own vehicle  and later on\n\ncommitted  murder in a brutal  manner. This entire story\n\nwas narrated  by the petitioner/accused before the\n\nMagistrate.\n\n8. \n\nChallan  was submitted in  the Court on\n\n06.06.2018, charged  was framed on 03-07.2018 and at\n\npresent  six prosecution  witnesses have recorded their\n\nstatements. The record of trial Court reveals that trial is\n\nproceeding  on fast track. The Power of attorney on\n\nbehalf of petitioner was submitted in the trial Court  on\n\n06.09.2018,  where-after 58 dates of hearing have been\n\nfixed  before the trial Court,  whereas  the Presiding\n\nOfficer was on leave on 07 dates of hearing,  05\nadjournments were granted  due to strike of Bar\n\nAssociation  and 08 adjournments  were granted  due to\n\nabsence  of prosecution  witnesses. Even otherwise,  the\n\ncase has been fixed for 09 dates of hearing  in the month\n\n\fCrl. Misc.  No.421lB/2019\n\n4\n\nof luly,  2019, for 06 dates of hearing in the month of\n\nJune, 2019 and for 07 times in the month  of May,2019\n\nbefore the learned trial Cour! which clearly spells out\n\nthat the trial Court is proceeding  with the case in fast\n\ntrack manner.\n\n9. \n\nKeeping in  view the above background,\n\npetitioner is tentatively  linked with the hideous  crime of\n\nmurder of her own husband  with the help of co-accused\n\nandprima-facie  she is involved in the alleged  murder.  No\n\nmalafide or ill will has been established on record\n\nagainst prosecution witnesses for false implication  of\n\npetitioner in this case  and no ground  of further inquiry\n\nexists in favour of petitioner. The evidentiary  value of\n\nstatement U/S  1,64 Cr.P.C.  will be assessed during the\n\ncourse of trial which is at the verge of conclusion,\n\ntherefore, any benefit of grant of post arrest bail on\n\nmerit is not made out.\n\n10.  The petitioner  is a woman  having suckling child\n\nin jail, however,  in the peculiar circumstances  while\n\nconsidering  the background of the case, role of\n\npetitioner in the commission of murder of deceased\n\nclearly  amounts to facilitating the commission  of\n\noffence. The statement of  the petitioner  is  self\n\ninculpatory  and in such circumstances  the bail has been\n\ndenied. Reliance is placed  upon 2012 MLD L894",

Naeem Tahir, A.S.l.\nQazi Rehan Shabbir, Advocate  for  the\ncomplainanuresPondent  No.2\n\nThrough the instant petition, the petitioner,\nUmair  Khan seeks  post-arrest  bail in case F.l.R.\nNo.424, dated 27.09.2018, offences under Sections\n420,468  and 471 P.P.C. registered at Police Station\n\nKohsar, lslamabad.\n2.  Earlier the petitioner's similar petitions seeking\npost-arrest bail were dismissed  vide orders dated\n16.04.2019 and 01.06.2019  passed by the learned\nJudicial Magistrate  Section-30 and Additional\nSessions Judge, lslamabad, respectively.\n3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner  submits that\nthe petitioner has falsely been implicated  in the\nF.l.R. in qu.estion  with malafide  intentions  and\nulterior motives; that the petitioner  has nothing to\ndo with the commission of alleged crime as the main\nculprit is Ati Raza who telephonically  called the\ncomplainant,  Adeela  lmran, to come lslamabad  and\ngive an amount  of Rs.4,71 ,7841'through  cheque in\nadvance for the import of a  Suzuki car and\nharvester machine; that the petitioner was an\nemployee of accused  Ali Raza and on his direction,\nhe encashed the cheques  in question  and deposited\nthe above-said  amount in the account of Ali Raza;\nthat the petitioner  has already cooperated with the\ninvestigating officer and provided him the address\n\n\f2\n\nCrl.Misc.No  .463 -B 12019\n\nof the said Ali Raza; that the offences  alleged to\nhave been committed  by the petitioner do not fall\nwithin the ambit of prohibitory  clause of Section  497\nCr.P.C.; and that the petitioner  is behind  bars for\nquite long time and is no more required for further\ninvestigation.  Learned  counsel has prayed for the\npetition to be allowed  and for the petitioner to be\nreleased on bail.\n4.  On the other hand, learned  counsel for the\ncomplainant,  assisted  by the learned  State  Counsel,\nvehemently opposed the bail petition by stating that\nthe petitioner  is nominated  in the F.l.R. with specific\nrole of committing  fraud with the complainant and\ndepriving  her of an amount of Rs.4,71 ,7841-; that\naccording to the statement  of the manager of the\nguest  house, it was the petitioner who booked the\nroom in the guest house in the name of Geneva Car\nLeasing Private Limited; that the petitioner  had\nreceived the cheques in  question from the\ncomplainant  and got the same encashed from the\nbank as revealed  through the CCTV footage;  that\nthe said Goneva Gar Leasing  Private Limited\nCompany was not registered with the SECP;  that the\namount received from the complainant under the\npretext of booking a car and a harvester  machine\nfrom abroad had been equally divided by the\npetitioner and co-accused, Ali Raza; and that both\nthe accused in  connivance with each other\ncommitted fraud with the complainant.  Learned\ncounsel prayed for the bail petition  to be dismissed.\n5.  I have heard the contentions of the learned\ncounsel for the contesting parties and have perused\n\nthe record  with their able assistance.\n6.  Brief facts as stated in the F.l.R. are that the\ncomplainant was the resident of House  No.E/70\nCollege Chowk  Fareed Town, Sahiwal. lt  was\n\n\fJ\n\nCrl.Misc.No  .463 -B / 20 19\n\nreported in the F.l.R. that the complainant while\nsearching on OLX had read the publication  of a\nprivate  limited company  namely, Geneva Car\nLeasing, which provides  car leasing financial\nassistance  and contact No.03004986643 was\nprovided on its website  to avail the said leasing\nfacility. On reading the said publication, the\ncomptainant  called on the said mobile number and\nshowed interest in purchasing a Suzuki Wagon-R\ncar and a harvester  machine to a person,  namely,\nHussain  alias Ali Raza,  who also tried to convince\nher with regard to the purchase of the same. ln the\nreport,  it was also provided  that the said accused\nHusaain got in touch with the complainant  and\noffered her to come lslamabad.  Pursuant to the said\noffer, when the complainant  along with her husband\nreached at Daewoo bus stand at lslamabad on\n25.06.2018, a person namely, Umair came there  and\nbrought  them to Amyls Garden House  No.55,  Main\nSchool  Road, Sector F'612, lslamabad in Room\nNo.108 for stay. On reaching the said guest house,\nthey asked  the accused Umair about the car and a\nharvester machine.  Upon this, accused Umair gave\nthem assurance with regard to purchasing the car\netc, and as a result, the complainant  issued/gave\ntwo cheques valuing  Rs.4,71  ,7841' to  him as\nadvanced  money  for the import  of the said car and\nharvester  machine. The said cheques  were\nencashed on their presentation  before the bank\nconcerned by  the  accused/petitioner.  After\nreceiving/encashment  of the above-said cheques\nwhen the complainant asked about a car, the said\naccused Umair left the spot and later he did not\nreturn. Consequently,  the F.l.R. in question  was\nlodged against the accused  persons,  namely, Umair\nand Hussain, who in connivance  with each other,\n\n\f4\n\nCrl.Misc.No  .463 -B I 20 19\n\ncheated the complainant  and deprived  her of the\nabove-said  amount.\n7.  Apparently,  it was the petitioner  who received\nthe complainant  and her husband from the Daewoo\nbus stand and brought them to a guest  house called\nAmyls Garden for their stay. The room was booked\nby the petitioner in the said guest house with fake\ncompany name, i.e. Geneva  Car Leasing Private\nLimited. Furthermore, the record shows the\npetitioner's  involvement  in the encashment of the\ncheques in question as advance money from the\ncomplainant on the pretext of booking a car and a\nharvester machine from abroad.  The recovery\nmemo appended  with the record shows that CCTV\nfootage had been obtained from the Operational\nManager Bank Al-falah  Main Branch F-6 Nazim  ud\nDin Road, lslamabad, which shows the petitioner's\npresence  in the said Bank on 25.09.2018  and the\ncheques in question had been encashed  by him.\nBooking of a room with fake company name in the\nabove-said guest house  for stay of the complainant\nand her family,  admission with regard to receiving\nthe cheques in question from the complainant  under\nthe garb of advance money for booking  of a car and\na harvester machine, encashment  of the cheques  in\nquestion from the concerned bank, prima-facie,\nconnects the petitioner  with the commission of\nalleged crime. The record also shows that the\npetitioner  had dealt with the complainant  and her\nhusband on the matter regarding  purchasing  of a\ncar and a harvester  machine. Given the fact that the\ncheques  in question  had been encashed by the\npetitioner,  he cannot  claim to have no knowledge of\nthe transactions.  Even otherwise, the record shows\nthe petitioner's  connivance  with the co-accused,  Ali\n\n\f5\n\nCrl.Misc.No  .463 -B  120 L9\n\nRaza alias Hussain in cheating the complainant  and\n\ndepriving her of a huge amount.\n8.  ln view of the above tentative  assessment, the\npetitioner has failed to make out a case of further\ninquiry. Consequently,  the instant bail is dismissed.\nSince the co-accused  Ali Raza had gone into hiding\nsince 27.09.2018 and had been declared\nabsconder,  therefore, to the extent of the present\npetitioner, the learned Trial Court is directed  to\nconclude  the trial at the earliest.\n\nQamar Khan*",

Any  other  relief  zohich  this honorable Court  deem  proper'\n\n2.  Petitioner in person  states that he has deposited  Rs.68,000/-  through\n\npay order on 31.03.2004  in the office of Director General  Federal  Government\n\nEmployees  Housing Foundation  against journalist  quota and he has not been\n\nallotted  plot in Sector G-1-4,Islamabad;  that he filed W.P No.2838/201.4,  which\n\nwas disposed of vide order dated 18.11..201,6  with direction  to the Secretary,\n\nMinistry of Information & Broadcasting, Government of Pakistan  to determine\n\nthe eligibility  of petitioner  for allotment  of plot after affording  opportunity  of\n\n\fW.P  No.2247120t7\n\n2\n\nhearing to him and pass speaking  order; that said order  was assailed through\n\nICA No.542/2016  before the Division  Bench of this Court,  which was\n\ndismissed in limine vide order dated 08.12.201,6;  that despite retaining huge\n\namount since  2004, no plot has been allotted  to him.\n\n3.  Conversely, learned  counsel  for Housing  Foundation  contends  that\n\npetitioner  has availed the benefit  of plot and was allotted plot No.250,  Block-B,\n\nRawalpindi  Press Club  Housing Society  and is not entitled  for the benefit  of\n\npresent scheme/existing scheme launched  by the Housing  Foundation;  that\n\nMinistry  of Information & Broadcasting has already decided  the case of the\n\npetitioner vide letter dated 03.01,2017  and petitioner  was directed to get\n\nrefund  of Rs.58,000/- from FGEHF.\n\n4. \n\nArguments  heard, record  perused.\n\n5.  Perusal of record reveals that petitioner  applied for the allotment  of\n\nplot in Scheme  launched  by respondent  No.L  against 3% quota of journalist\n\nand deposited Rs.68,000/- on 31.03.2004 for the allotment of plot in G-1'4,\n\nIslamabad,  however,  he has not been considered  for the allotment  of plot\n\nwhereby he was constraint to file writ petition  which was disposed of with\n\ndirection to the Secretary, Ministry of Information  & Broadcasting  to consider\n\nthe eligibility  of the petitioner  and to decide  the case of petitioner  qua his\n\neligibility.  The petitioner  has assailed  the said order in ICA which was\n\ndismissed  in limine.  However,  it has been observed  from the record that  case\n\nof the petitioner has already  been turned  down by the Ministry of Information\n\n& Broadcasting  and directed the petitioner  to get refund from FGEHF.  The\n\npetitioner also approached the Wafaqi Mohtasib  who vide order dated\n\n10.03.2008  has held that case of the petitioner be considered in the next\n\nhousing scheme of FGEHF.\n\n\fW.P  No.2247l2OL7\n\n3\n\n6.  At this stage, I have asked  the petitioner  to substantiate the status of\n\nany plot which has not yet been allotted, whereby  he states that it is the job of\n\nHousing Foundation  to provide  such information. Learned counsel  for\n\nrespondent  No.L contends  that no plot is available  in Sector  G-1.4,Islamabad\n\nand scheme  has already been completed, however,  he further  contends  that if\n\nthe petitioner will apply in the next scheme  he will be considered in the light\n\nof order passed by Wafaqi Mohtasib,  if otherwise eligible.\n\n7.  Keeping in view the above background,  the prayer made by the\n\npetitioner  is not justified as the scheme has already been  closed and at the\n\nmost petitioner  can be considered  for any future scheme  subject to condition\n\nthat he fulfils  eligibility  criteria and on the recommendation of Secretary,\n\nMinistry of Information & Broadcasting,  his case will be considered at\n\nappropriate  level in accordance  with the criteria  fixed in the future scheme by\n\nthe competent  authority. The order dated  10.03.2008, passed  by Wafaqi\n\nMohtasib  also  substantiate  the similar relief wherein it has been  held that case\n\nof the petitioner  will be considered  in the journalists  quota in the next housing\n\nscheme of FGEHF.\n\n8. \n\nThe petitioner has failed to submit any valid reason in his favour as to\n\nwhether this Court can scrutinize the facts  qua his eligibility for the purpose  of\n\nallotrarent  as it relates to a factual dispute,  which could only  be resolved  by the\n\nCourt  of plenary jurisdiction.  Even otherwise,  housing foundation  has taken\n\ncategorical stance that petitioner has already  availed the benefit of allotment\n\nin other housing  society  and as such he is not shelter less, although  petitioner\n\nhas taken a stance  that there  is no bar in the eligibility  criteria that any person\n\nor his family  members  if retained  any other plot or house are not eligible.\n\n9.  Keeping  in view the above background,  prayer  made by the petitioner\n\nat this stage could not be materialized  and if Ministry of Information &\n\n\fW.P  No.2247l2OL7\n\n4\n\nBroadcasting  recorunends  name of the petitioner  for any future  scheme of\n\nFGEHF his case would be considered  on priority  basis subject to condition\n\nthat petitioner  apply in the future scheme  afresh and fulfill the criteria as at\n\nthis stage scheme in which petitioner  has submitted application has already\n\nbeen closed  and completed,  therefore,  this Court cannot enter into factual\n\ndispute  qua the double  allotment  or eligibility  of other applicants  through\n\nfalse information  as such kind of action  could only be taken by the concerned\n\nquarters  of housing foundation.\n\n10.  Be that as it may,  instant petition  stands  ilisposed  of with direction to\n\nthe petitioner to apply in the future scheme of FGEHF subject  to\n\nreconunendation  of Ministry of Information &  Broadcasting  and after\n\nfulfilling the other codal  formalities and requirement.  The amount earlier\n\ndeposited with the FGEHF by the petitioner  in the previous  scheme be\n\nreturned  to the petitioner  within30  days.\n\nZehid",

Brief  facts are that  the above  referred  FIR was lodged by\n\nrespondent  No.2/complainant  with the allegations that on\n\n08.09.2018, at about 7:55 p.m, Saeed Mumtaz  Durani,  ex-\n\nhusband of sister in law of respondent  No.2 visited  his house\n\nNo.l3,Street No.38,  Sector  G-6-ll3,Islamabad  and when his son\n\nAbdul  Ahad Faisal  opened  the door on door bell, Saeed  Mumtaz\n\nDurani  fired  upon him but he rescued  himself  while entering  into\n\nhis house. Saeed  Mumtaz  Durani  forcefully  entered in the house\n\nand fired upon wife of respondent  No.2fuzma  Faisal and there-\n\nafter fled away from the scene in Honda Civic No.IDN-7329.\n\nThe motive  of the said incident is family dispute of Saeed\n\nMumtaz  Durani with ex-wife/sister  in law of respondent No.2.\n\n3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends  that the\n\npetitioner  is innocent  and has falsely  been implicated  in this  case;\n\nthat the petitioner  was  arrested on 12.10.2018,  challan has been\n\nsubmiffed  in the Court, even  evidence of major witresses  has\n\n\f2\n\nCrl. Misc.  No.386-B/2019.\n\nbeen recorded and  there is no apprehension  of tampering with\n\nprosecution  evidence  and no useful  purpose  would  be served\n\nwhile  keeping  the petitioner  behind the bars, who is languishing\n\nin jail for the last eight  months.\n\n4.  Conversely,  learned counsel for respondent No.2  and\n\nlearned  State  Counsel  contend  that the petitioner has  been\n\ncharged with direct  role of causing  fire arm injuries  to the lady,\n\nwho has nothing  to do with the family dispute;  that the offence\n\nfalls within  prohibitory clause  of section 497 Cr.P.C and the tial\n\nis about to conclude.\n\n5.  I have  heard  the arguments and perused  the record.\n\n6.  From perusal of the record, it has been observed  that the\n\npetitioner  has been charged  with  direct role of causing  two fire\n\narms injuries to Uzma  Faisal,  sister in law of respondent No.2 on\n\n08.09.2018,  at about  7:55 p.m while entering into House No.l3,\n\nStreet No.38, Sector G-6-ll3,Islamabad  by force.\n\n7.  It also  reveals from the contents of the FIR that the\n\npetitioner  also fired upon Abdul  Hahad,  son of respondent No.2.\n\nWeapon of offence  has already been recovered  from the\n\npetitioner.  The  challan  has been submitted before the Court,\n\ncharged  has been framed on0L.04.2019 and at present statements\n\nof three star witnesses have been recorded  and only two\n\nwitresses are left to be examined.\n\n8.  Keeping  in view above  background,  prima facie the\n\npetitioner  is connected with commission of heinous  crime of\n\ncausing  grievous hurt to Unna Faisal, whose  medical  certificate\n\nreveals  that  four injuries have  been caused and she remained  in\n\nthe hospital for considerable  period and  the nature of injuries  has\n\nbeen referred  as Jurh Jaifah",

Azlz ur Rehman Zla, Advocate for\n\nOrder wlth slgnature  of Judge and that of\npartles or counselwhere necessarv\n\npetlUoner.\n\nThrough the instant writ petition,\n\nthe petitioner, Asim lrfan, impugns  the\n\njudgment  dated 04.12.2018,  passed by\n\nthe Court of learned Additional District\n\nJudge, lslamabad, whereby the\n\npetitioner's appeal against the\njudgment and  decreed  dated\n17.07.2018,  passed by the learned\n\nJudge Family  Court, lslamabad,  was\n\ndismissed. Vide the said judgment  and\n\ndecree  dated  17.07.2018,  the learned\n\nFamily Court had decreed  respondents\n\nNo.1 and 2s' suit for recovery of past,\n\npresent and future maintenance,  etc.\n\nThe learned  Appellate Court has\n\ndismissed the petitioner's  appeal on the\n\nground of !imitation.\n\nThe judgment and decree was\n\npassed  by the learned Family Court on\n\n17.07.2018.  The petitioner applied for\n\nthe  certified copies of  the  said\n\n4\\y\n\n\f_t\n\ng,\n\n+\n\n,\n\njudgment and decree on 05.11.2018,\n\nand on the very same d\"y, they were\n\ndelivered  to the petitioner. The appeal\n\nhad been filed before the learned\n\nAppellate  Court on 14.11.2018.  The\n\nlearned Appellate Court has correctly\n\nobserved that the petitioner had 30\n\ndays within which to file an appea!\n\nagainst  the said judgment and decree\n\npassed  by the learned  Family Court.\n\nBeing cognizant of the fact that\n\nthe  appeal was filed beyond  the\n\nlimitation  period provided  by law, the\n\npetitioner had also filed an application\n\nfor condonation of delay alongwith his\n\nappeal. In the said application,  the\n\npetitioner had pleaded that the appea!\n\ncould not be filed within time due to the\nserious i!!ness qf  the  petitioner's\n\nmother. The documents on which the\n\npetitioner placed reflance  upon show\n\nthat  the  petitioner's mother had\n\nsuffered from ailments, but they were\n\nnot such as would have rendered the\n\npetitioner  unable to  file an appeal\nagainst the judgment and decree\n\npassed by the learned Appellate Court.\n\nSince the petitioner's  appeal was time\n\n\f3\n\nbarred by about two and half months;\n\nand since the petitioner was unable  to\n\nexplain the delay of each day in filing\n\nthe appea!, I have been given no reason\n\nto interfere with the Appellate judgment\n\ndated 04.12.20118.  The  discretion\n\nexercised by the learned  Appellate\nCourt in dismissing  the petitioner's\n\nappeal on the ground of limitation does\nnot suffer from any jurisdictiona!\nirregularity so  as  to  warrant\ninterference in  the  Constitutional\n\njurisdiction of this Court.

Mr. Faisal Ramzan Ghauri, Advocate for the petitioner. \nMr. Sadaqat Ali Jahangir, State Counsel. \nFarzana Kausar/respondent No.2 in person. \nHumaira Aslam, S.I, FIA, Cyber Crime, Islamabad. \n\nThrough  instant  petition,  the  petitioner  has  prayed  for  his \n\npost  arrest bail in case FIR No.08/18,  dated 28.11.2018, U/S 20, \n\n21, 24 of PECA 2016 r/w sections 509, 109 PPC, P.S FIA, Cyber \n\nCrime Circle, Islamabad. \n\n2. \n\nBrief facts are that above mentioned FIR was lodged on the \n\ncomplaint  of  respondent  No.2/Farzana  Kausar,  wherein  she \n\nalleged that present petitioner  lshtiaq  Ahmed and his co-accused \n\nSyed  Sajjad  Hussain  Shah  with  active  collaboration  with  each \n\nother \n\nillegally  and  unauthorizedly  up-loaded,  generated, \n\nposted/shared  personal  sexually  explicit  pictures  of  respondent \n\nNo.2  on  WhatsApp  account  and  she  was  also  harassed  and \n\nblackmailed.  During  the  course  of  inquiry  phone  numbers \n\n03318827430  and  03329566378  used  in  the  commission  of the \n\noffence  were  found  in  the  names  of  co-accused  Muhammad \n\nImran  and  present  petitioner  lshtiaq  Ahmed  and  data  was \n\nretrieved from mobile of the petitioner HTC-Desired 3260. \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that  the \n\npetitioner  is  behind  the  bars  since  28.11.2018,  investigation  of \n\nthe  case  has  been  completed  and  the  petitioner  is  no  more \n\n\f2 \n\nCrl. Misc. No.979-B/2018. \n\nrequired for the purpose of further investigation; that the offences \n\nwith  which  the  petitioner  has  been  charged  do  not  fall  within \n\nprohibitory  clause  of  section  497  Cr.P.C;  that  respondent  No.2 \n\nherself  sent  her  pictures  on  mobile  phone  of  the  petitioner  and \n\nthe  pictures  were  neither  uploaded  by  the  petitioner  in  any \n\nmanner nor generated and transmitted in any information system; \n\nthat detailed analysis has not yet been received and the petitioner \n\nis languishing injail  since 28.11.2018. \n\n4. \n\nConversely,  learned  State  Counsel  has  contended  that  the \n\npetitioner  and  his  co-accused  induced  respondent  No.2  for \n\nexplicit  photographs  and  later  on  exhibited,  displayed  and \n\ntransmitted  the  images  on  WhatsApp  numbers  and  started \n\nblackmailing her for nefarious designs. \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nI have heard the arguments and gone through the record. \n\nFrom  tentative  assessment  of  record,  it  transpires  that \n\nrespondent  No.2  lodged  the  complaint  with  police  station  FIA, \n\nCyber  Crime  Circle,  Islamabad  with  the  allegations  that  the \n\npetitioner  Ishtiaq  Ahmed  and  his  co-accused  Syed  Sajjad \n\nHussain  Shah  in  collusion  with  each  other \n\nillegally  and \n\nunauthorizedly  uploaded  pictures  of  respondent  No.2  on \n\nWhatsApp  account  and  damaged  her  reputation,  honour  and \n\nmodesty  amongst  the  family  members  and  as  a  result  whereof \n\nFIR No. 08/18, dated 28.11.2018, U/S 20, 21, 24 of PECA 2016 \n\nr/w  sections  509,  109  PPC,  P.S  FIA,  Cyber  Crime  Circle, \n\nIslamabad was registered. \n\n7. \n\nCursory glimpse of record reflects that at the time of arrest \n\nof  the  petitioner,  he  was  in possession  of  mobile  phone,  which \n\nwas  taken  into possession  through  recovery  memo  and the  said \n\nmobile  phone  was  having  explicit  images  and  photographs  of \n\n\f3 \n\nCr!. Misc. No.979-8/2018. \n\nrespondent No.2,  which prima facie connects the petitioner with \n\nthe  commission  of the  alleged  offence.  The  allegations  leveled \n\nby  respondent  No.2  against  the  petitioner  fall under  sections 20 \n\n&  21  of The  Prevention  of Electronic  Crimes  Act  2016  as  the \n\npetitioner uploaded the photographs of natural person in sexually \n\nexplicit  manner,  even  statement  of the  witness/respondent  No.2 \n\nreveals  inducement,  intimidation  and  harassment,  for  which \n\ninformation system and network has been used for the purpose of \n\ncommunication of photographs and the said act falls within ambit \n\nof Cyber stalking in terms of section 21  of the Act ibid. \n\n8. \n\nThe entire record does not reveal any act of further inquiry \n\nin  favour  of  the  petitioner  and  even  the  petitioner  could  not \n\njustify  any  reasonable  ground  in  his  favour  to  disassociate him \n\nfrom the alleged crime. The mobile phone  used by the petitioner \n\ncontains images although the other information  network used by \n\nthe petitioner  and his co-accused is based upon  laptop and other \n\nmobile  phones,  which  are under process  of forensic  analysis by \n\nFIA.  The  element  of fear  is  apparent  through  which  respondent \n\nNo.2  was  forced  to  agree  with  the  demands  of  the  accused \n\npersons. \n\n9.  WhatsApp images prima  facie connects the petitioner with \n\nhideous  crime,  which  in  other  words  is  a  crime  against  the \n\nhumanity and the society. Conduct of the petitioner shows that he \n\nis  lacking  moral  turpitude,  who  himself  exploited  respondent \n\nNo.2.  Granting bail to the petitioner  at this  stage would amount \n\nto  trivialize  and  play  down  the  gravity  of  offence  allegedly \n\ncommitted by him. \n\n\f4 \n\nCrl. Misc. No.979-B/2018. \n\n10.  For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  I  am  not  inclined  to \n\naccepted the  instant post  arrest bail petition,  therefore, the  same \n\nis here dismissed. \n\nR.Anjam",

Conversely,  learned counsel for respondent No.2  has\n\ncontended  that it is not mandatory in every  case to suspend  the\n\nsentence,  even in cases where the sentence  is short; that the\n\npetitioner  is charged  with the offence  of moral turpitude, who  has\n\nruined life of the complainant/respondent  No.2 by creating her\n\nfake facebook  ID and  blackmailed  her by uploading  her obscene\n\npictures;  that the mobile phone and laptop  have  been recovered\n\nfrom  the petitioner  and as such the duly established  technical\n\nevidence  recorded  by FIA Forensic Experts has proved the case\n\nagainst  the petitioner.\n\n\f3\n\nC.M  No.01/2018  in Crl.  Appeal No.1372018.\n\n5.  I have  heard  the arguments and  gone  through  the record.\n\n6.  There is no cavil to the proposition  that section 426 Cr.P.C\n\nis meant  to deal with  suspension of the sentence, release  of the\n\nappellant on bail pending the appeal, however,  the pre-requisite\n\nto exercise  such  powers is that when  the delay is apparent in the\n\ndecision  of the appeal, although  there is no denial that the\n\npunishment/sentence  awarded to the petitioner  is 03 years for\n\neach offence U/S 36 & 37 WO 2002.  However, the delay in\n\ndeciding the appeal is paramount  consideration  for suspension  of\n\nsentence, whereas  instant appeal has been filed on 12.09.2018\n\nonly a month  ago, therefore,  the exception  to exercise the\n\njurisdiction UIS 426, Cr.P.C provided in subsection  I-A is\n\n$whose appeal  has not been  decided wilhin  period of 06 months\n\nof conviction \" whereas the petitioner  has claimed  suspension  of\n\nthe sentence prior to expiry of 06 months  after his conviction,\n\nwhich seems  pre-mature  at this stage.\n\n7.  Learned  counsel  for the petitioner  as well as learned\n\ncounsel  for respondent No.2  has relied upon 2@N1-L[652.\n\nIKarachil",

        "Summary": "under sections 420, 468 and 471 Police \n\na. \nStation Ramna may kindly be quashed. \n\nThe legal actions may kindly be initiated against respondent No.2 for harassing, \n\nb. \ndefaming and registering false FIRs against the petitioners. \n\nDirections  may  kindly  be  issued  to  the  police  officials  not  to  register  fake  FIRs \n\nc. \nagainst the petitioner and her brother. \n\nThis Hon'ble Court may grant any other relief deemed appropriate in view of the facts and \ncircumstances of the case.\" \n\nAnd presented the facts as under; \n\n2. \nThat Nikah of petitioner No.1 with respondent No.2 was solemnized on 03.05.2007, out of \nthis wedlock two daughters namely Rahima Nisar and Fatima Nisar, aged 10 years and 5 years \nwere born. That respondent No.2 pronounced talaq upon petitioner No.1 on 24.09.2016, resultantly \nrelationship of husband and wife terminated permanently. That respondent No.2 lodged an FIR \nNo.17/2018 dated 12.01.2018 against the petitioners, wherein, it has been alleged that the original \npassports, birth certificates and family registration certificate of the minors are in his possession \nand petitioners have made a fake report of lost documents, on which stamp of police station Rata \nAmral is also fictitious. On the basis of this report petitioner No.1 obtained fresh passports of the \nminor girls and took them abroad on 20.12.2017, complainant further alleged that petitioners had \nthreatened him that they would take his daughters abroad, forever. That the court has granted the \ninterim  custody  of  the  minors  to  petitioner  No.1  being  real  mother  and  suits  for  jactitation  of \nmarriage and Appointment of Guardian are also pending before the court of competent jurisdiction. \nThat infact, petitioner No.1 went for performing 'Umrah' along with minors and this fact was well \nwithin the knowledge of respondent No.2. That petitioners claim is that alleged fake police report \nfor obtaining fresh passports was provided to petitioner No.1 by respondent No.2 himself. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fLearned  counsel  for  Petitioners  contended  that  impugned  FIR  has  been  lodged  just  to \n3. \nblackmail, humiliate and harass petitioner No.1 and in order to defame her in the society, to compel \npetitioner No.1 to surrender the custody of minors and for waiving her accrued valuable rights. \nThe  very  registration  of  case  is  tainted  with  mala  fide,  which  is  result  of  lucrative  influence \nexercised  by  respondent  No.2,  on  the  local  police.  Learned  counsel  further  contended  that \npetitioner No.1 had already informed the Superintendent of Police that passports of the minors are \nin the custody of respondent No.2 and also that she is not safe from the illegal and harmful designs \nof respondent No.2. Learned counsel added that another application for registration of FIR has \nalso been filed by respondent No.2, wherein it has been alleged that petitioners have received an \namount of Rs.20 million from him, all the complaints filed by respondent No. 2 are spurious and \nare  just  intended  to  initiate  false  criminal  proceedings  against  the  petitioners  to  settle  family \nmatters.  Learned  counsel  lastly  contended  that  the  entire  proceedings  pending  against  the \npetitioners are totally misconceived as  from  the  collective reading of  FIR no criminal  intent  is \nfound, therefore, the machinery of criminal law could not be set in motion and further continuation \nof trial would be a futile exercise. \n\n4. \nOn the other hand learned counsel for respondent No.2 along with learned State counsel \nopposed the request of quashment of FIR and prayed for the dismissal of writ petition. Learned \ncounsel  for  respondent  No.2  while  rebutting  the  contentions  raised  by  the  learned  counsel  for \npetitioners contended that birth certificates and family registration certificate of the minors were \nin possession of respondent No.2 and the petitioners have made a fake report of lost documents \nwithout informing respondent No.2 who is the real father of the minors, with the intention to take \nthem  abroad,  on  which  stamp  of  Police  Station  Rata  Amral  is  also  fake  and  this  act  of  the \npetitioners constitutes serious offence under the criminal law, therefore, present petitioners does \nnot  deserve  any  leniency  and  they  must  be  tried  under  the  law.  That  respondent  No.2  denies \npronouncement of divorce. \n\nI  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  parties  and  have  gone  through  the  relevant  record \n\navailable on file. \n\n5. \nThe stand of complainant/respondent No.2 in the impugned FIR is that petitioners have \ntaken  his  daughters  abroad  with  the  intention  to  keep  them  away  from  him  forever.  Whereas, \nperusal of record reveals this fact that petitioner No.1 along with minors proceeded to Kingdom of \nSaudi Arabia to perform 'Umrah' and returned back to Pakistan, which by itself, prima facie, does \nnot disclose any intent regarding taking the minors away rather negates the stance of complainant. \nThe interim custody of the minors has been given to petitioner No.1",

The assailants threatened them,\ntherefore, they went inside the house due to fear. Then the\nassailants came over the roof of adjacent house.  Imran\nmade burst of Kalashnikov  which hit Khalid Farooq slo\nIshtiaq-ul-  Sallkeen  inside of his left shoulder, who fell on\nthe ground and succumbed  to the injuries. The trio\ndecamped from the place of occurrence.  Complainant\nfurther added that the offence  was committed at the\ninstigation of Imtiaz Ali Khokhar  alias Taji Khokhar/present\npetitioner.\n4. \nIn Crl. Misc No. LB5-Bl20t7 it is disclosed  that\nduring investigation  of above F.I.R, it proved that the\npetitioner  was falsely  involved in this case and there was\nno evidence of abetment,  therefore, a private  complaint\nwas filed. After issua nce of  process, the petitioner\nsubmitted an application under Section 91 Cr. P'C in\nprivate complaint  before the learned  ASJ, Islamabad in\nwhich the petitioner  was directed to submit bail bonds to\nthe tune of Rs.one lac with one surety. However,  the\ncomplainant challenged the order dated 22.6.2013  before\nthis court in Crl, Revision,  which was disposed of with the\n\n\fCrl.Misc No. 184-B/2OL7  &\n785-B/20t7\n\nJ\n\nobservations  that the fate of the case is to be decided  by\nthe court concerned  i.e trial court on submitting the bail\napplication. In pursuance whereof, bail applications  of the\npetitioner in  both the matters have been dismissed\nthrough consolidated  order dated  t8.3.20t7.\n5. \nIn support of petitions, learned counsel  for the\npetitioner contended  that the petitioner is an old man of 64\nyears, who is suffering  from multiple diseases. The\npetitioner  was under treatment in Jail Hospital, but the\nfunctioning  of kidneys was failed, therefore, h\u20ac  was\nimmediately shifted to Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi in\na critical condition where he was admitted on 01.03.20t7.\nIt is added  that in Holy Family  Hospital due to heart attack\nthe petitioner  was shifted in a critical condition to the\nRawalpindi  Institute of Cardiology.  Thereafter, he was\nshifted back to Holy Family  Hospital,  where the petitioner\nis going through the process  of dialysis. The petitioner\nrequires specialized  treatment for the curement  of diseases.\nIt  is vigorously contended that the  petitioner is in\nincarceration  for the last more than 3Vz years. The\npetitioner  was not present at the place  of occurrence and\nthe only allegation  against the petitioner is of abetment.\nThere is no detail of witnesses  in the police record.  The\nallegation of abetment levelled against the petitioner  is ex\nante. The petitioner  being old, weak and seriously sick and\ninfirm person  is entitled to the concession of bail. To\nsupplement  his submissions,  learned counsel relied upon\nFidous Paul v. The State",

In \n\nthe meantime, differences rose between the parties as according to petitioner, respondent \n\nNo.2/husband  contracted  second  marriage  whereafter she  instituted suit  for  recovery of \n\nmaintenance  for  herself  and  for  minor  daughter.  Simultaneously,  the  respondent  No.2 \n\nfiled a suit for jactitation of marriage against petitioner No.1 which is pending adjudication.  \n\nDuring  the  course  of  proceedings  upon  suit  for  maintenance  filed  by  petitioner,  learned \n\nFamily Judge vide order dated 2.2.2012 fixed interim maintenance of Rs.15,000/- for the \n\nminor girl, but the respondent No.2 failed to pay the same despite direction. Consequently \n\nvide  order  dated  15.4.2013,  learned  Judge  Family  Court  struck  off  the  defense  of \n\nrespondent No.2 and decreed the suit in accordance with prayer whereby maintenance of \n\nRs.  1,50,000/-  per  month  was  sought  since  August,  2011.  The  judgment  debtor \n\n[respondent  No.2  herein]  moved  appeal  which  culminated  upon  impugned  Judgment \n\ndated  4.6.2013  whereby  the  quantum  of  maintenance  fixed  by  learned  Judge  Family \n\nCourt was reduced to the tune of Rs. 15,000/- per month with annual increase  @ 15 % \n\nbeginning from August, 2011 till her marriage or till the adverse decision of learned Civil \n\nCourt  regarding  legitimacy  of  minor  child.  Aggrieved  thereby,  petitioner  moved  present \n\nWrit Petition with following prayer;- \n\n\u201cThe  impugned  Judgment  dated  4.6.2013  passed  by  the  learned \nAddl.District  Judge  may  graciously  be  set  aside  by  upholding  the \norder/decree passed by the learned Family Judge, Islamabad.\u201d \n\n2.             Learned counsel for petitioners submits that the impugned Judgment & Decree \n\npassed  by  learned  Appellate Court  is  preposterous  and  devoid  of  sound  reasonings  as \n\nthe  conduct  of  respondent  No.2  before  learned  Trial  Court  has  been  completely \n\noverlooked by the learned Appellate Court. \n\n3. \n\nIt  is  further  submitted  that  the  decree  passed  by  learned  Trial  Court  is  in \n\naccordance with statutory provisions contained under Section 17-A of Family Court Act, \n\n1964  as  the  suit  can  be  decreed  if  defendant  makes  default  in  payment  of  interim \n\nmaintenance.  The reduction in quantum of maintenance by the learned Appellate Court \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f                  Writ Petition No.3608 of 2013 \n2 \n\nfrom  Rs.1,50,000/-  to  Rs.15,000/-  is  summersault  upon  the  rights  of  petitioner  without \n\nauthority of law or reasoning.   \n\n4. \n\n   It  is  next  submitted  that  respondent/husband  kept  prolonging  the  matter  of \n\npaying the maintenance for one reason or the other and when vide order dated 2.2.2012 , \n\nlearned Family Court fixed the interim maintenance, he moved Review Application and an \n\napplication  for  conducting  DNA  test  disputing  the  paternity  of  child,  but  the  said \n\napplications were dismissed vide order dated 1.2.2013 and the learned Trial Court passed \n\nan order by warning the respondent No.2 that if he failed to pay the interim maintenance, \n\nhis right of defence will be considered closed, yet he failed to pay the same and instead \n\nmoved  Writ-Petition  before  this  Court  which  was  dismissed  in  limine  vide  order  dated \n\n20.2.2013  and  I.C.A  thereagainst  also  failed.  The  learned  Trial  Court  after  dismissal  of \n\nI.C.A , once again ordered the respondent for payment of interim maintenance vide order \n\ndated 15.4.2013, but he did not pay any heed to it. Resultantly vide order dated 4.6.2013, \n\nhis  defence  was  closed  and  the  suit  was  decreed  as  prayed  for  under  Section  17-A \n\nFamily Court Act, 1964. \n\n5. \n\nLearned  counsel  further  stated  that  learned  Appellate  Court  transgressed  its \n\njurisdiction by giving relief to the respondent No.2/appellant which he had not sought as \n\nthe  appellant  had  merely  prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the  order  dated  15.4.2013,  but \n\nlearned ADJ traveled beyond the scope of prayer by reducing the quantum of  decree to \n\nan extent of his own choice which runs counter to the law on subject, because a Court \n\ncannot award relief beyond the pleadings at appellate stage. \n\n6. \n\n  Learned counsel next averred that the impugned Judgment does not point out \n\nany evidentiary material on the basis of which it resorted to modify the Judgment passed \n\nby learned Trial Court. He pointed out that the respondent/husband is a cricketer of inter \n\nnational \n\nlevel  with  abundant  resources  of  earning \n\nthrough  multinational/national \n\ncompanies and cricket clubs as well as advertisements and media appearances, thus he \n\nearns millions of rupees a month, hence the maintenance of Rs.1,50,000/- was very much \n\nin  accordance  with  the  status  of  respondent  No.2,  who  did  not  pay  a  single  penny  on \n\naccount of maintenance to minor girl.  \n\n7. \n\n It  is  lastly  submitted  that  the  respondent  No.2  leveled  highly  unethical  and \n\nimmoral allegations against the petitioner No.1 despite having remained unsuccessful in \n\nDNA expedition. He did not contribute in upbringing of minor knowingly that petitioner is \n\nnot  an  independent  woman  as  her  parents  have  died  and  she  has  limited  sources  to \n\nmaintain the family. The learned counsel for petitioner has placed reliance on case laws \n\ntitled as",

Her grievance  is that at the time\nof desertion in August,  20L2, gold ornaments were  snatched  and\nthis fact is also evident from  Para  2 of her plaint, therefore,  in sudr\nstate of aff.aits,when  the ornaments  were already in possession  of\nthe respondent there  was no iustification  to burden her with\ncondition of its retum. It was also stipulated  in the plaint  that she\nwould  file a suit for rettrm  of the same  but after  deciding to get\nI<}rula  opted to relinquish  her claim but the learned courts\nmisunderstood  her statement  which,  otherwise, was very specific\nas she had forgiven the dower  claim and did not undertake to\nreftrrn  the same.

The law on\nthe subject is very specific  and  she had to return the consideration\nin lieu of Khula  divorce.  If it is not the case, she cannot be held\nentitled  to decree for dissolution of marriage  on the condition  of\nKhula, until & tmless it is established  that with whom  the dower\n\nHeard  and record  Perused.\nThe pivotal  question  whidr requires determination  is as to\n\nconsideration lies.\n5- \n6- \nwhat will be the impact  upon a decree  for dissolution of marriage\non the basis  of Khula, when  it is passed  subiect to return of dower\nconsideration,  when the custody of dower consideration  is\n\ndisputed?\nThe dispute is with regard to the possession of gold\n7- \nomaments / dower consideration.  The petitioner alleges that the\nsame are in custody of the respondent  whereas  the respondent\ndenies  this assertion,  therefore, this controversial  issue, cannot  be\nsettled without affording opportunity  to both the sides to adduce\ntheir respective  evidence, but while  doing this exercise,  the decree\nfor dissolution of marriage  on the basis of I(hula, cannot be\nrevoked  and will remain  intact.  This view is fortified by the law\n\nset in case of Doctor Akhlaq  VS Kishwar sultana  [PLD 1983 SC\n\n169]  wherein it is held that \"non paSment  of stipulated  consideration\n\nfor I(rula dose  not invalidate  the dissolution  of marriage by I(hula.  Once\nthe Family  Court  came  to the conclusion  cannot  remain with the limits of\nGod and the dissolution  of marriage by I(hula  must  take place,  the\ninquiry  into the terms on which such dissolution shall take place does\nnot effect  the conclusion  but only  creates  civil  liabilities  to the benefits  to\nbe retumed  by the wife to the husband and  does  not effect the\ndissolution  itself\".\ng- \nFollowing  the wisdom laid down in the case referred\nabove, it is concluded that the proper  course in this case would  be\nto frame  an issue respectinS  claim & counter  claim of the parties\nwith regard to gold omaments,  by recording  evidence  of both  the\nsides and to decide the case accordingly.  The decree for\ndissolution of marriage  pronounced  vide order  dated  22.L0.20L2\nshall remain intact and further proceedings  with regard to divorce\nshall be conducted pursuant  to provisions  of family laws that\nincludes sending of notice to the concemed  union council. Here it\nis also made  clear that in case the petitioner succeeds in her claim\nregarding  possession of gold omaments with the respondent-\ndefendant,  she will not be entitled to recover  the same pursuant  to\nher undertaking/statement  dated  22.10.20L2,  whereby  she had\nforgiven dower consideration  and if the situation  is vice-versa,\n\n*dt,Frrg.rrt*;J:ffii#ffi1 \n\n]#;P''W[,'*'i  l\n\n\fJ\n\nWfl Pailion  No.31462013\n\nthen the respondent-defendant  would be entitled  to recover  the\nsame  as a civil liability.

However,  suit\n\nregarding restitution  of conjugal rights was also dismissed\n\nFeeling aggrieved of the same, the petitioner husband filed the\n\npresent writ petition\n\n3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner  submitted  that\n\npetitioner/husband had paid dower  amount on the wedding\n\nnight to the respondenUwife and the petitioner/husband  had\n\nstated  the same  fact before the Court. The wife as such,  was\n\nrequired  to produce evidence  to disprove the claim of the\n\nhusband.  !t was further  submitted that the allegation  of cruelty\n\nwas not proved  against the husband. The wife had left the\n\nhouse of her husband at her own sweet-will and therefore,  she\n\nis not entitled to maintenance  allowance.  Learned counsel  also\n\nsubmitted that since there is no suit for dissolution of marriage,\n\nthe dower  amount  had been paid, therefore,  the petitioner\n\nhusband  was entitled  to decree for restitution  of conjugal rights.\n\n4.

Admitted  position in the present case is that dower\n\namount fixed at the time of marriage  was Rs.3,00,000/-.  lt is\n\nalso admitted that the maintenance  allowance, agreed at the\n\ntime of Nikkah was Rs.4000  per month.

Contention of the petitioner\n\nhusband is that he had paid the dower amount on the wedding\n\nnight and in this respect  had deposed  before  the learned  trial\n\nCourt. Mere  statement  before the Court cannot be considered\n\nas a proof in its own-self.  The petitioner  husband  is bound to\n\nprove the payment of dower  amount through  evidence. ln\n\nabsence  of cogent evidence, sim[le statement cannot be\n\nconsidered  as a proof and in such case, the onus would  not\n\nshift to the wife to disprove  the claim of the husband. Mere\n\nstatement that dower was paid on the wedding  night, is not\n\nsufficlent to prove the payment of dower.  lnfact, such a\n\nstatement  cannot even be considered as evidence.  The\n\npayment  of dower as such has not been proved.\n7.  Dower  infact is a debt against the husband  and in case\n\nthe dower amount is not paid, the wife would  have a right to\n\n\fW.la.

Once it is\n\nproved that the dower has not been paid, the wife would  be\n\nentitled to stay away from the husband and the husband would\n\nbe bound to pay maintenance  to his wife.  ln the present case,\n\nthere is no evidence  to prove that the husband had paid the\n\ndower amount and therefore, the wife is entitled  to receive\n\nmaintenance  allowance.\n\n8.  As far as amount of maintenance allowance is\nconcerned, the same was fixed in the Nikkah,nama as\n\nRs.4,000/-  per month, so both the learned lower Courts  had\n\nrightly fixed the said amount as maintenance allowance  of the\n\nrespondent  wife. Regarding  restitution of conjugal  rights, the\n\nlearned counsel for the respondent wife submitted  that the\n\nrespondent wife is prepared to live with the petitioner  husband\n\nprovided  the dower amount as well as the maintenance\n\nallowance  is paid to the wife and house for residential purpose\n\nis provided  to the respondent  wife. The allegation of cruelty has\n\nnot been proved, therefore, the petitioner husband is entitled to\n\nthe decree for restitution of conjugal  rights  subject  to payment\n\nof dower. The writ petition  in respect  of dower and maintenance\n\nallowance  is therefore,  dismissed,' whereas in respect of\n\nrestitution of conjugal  rights is accepted  subject to payment of\n\ndower\n\nWaju)",

A provisional\n\noffer was made by Respondent No.1 vide provisional offer\n\nletter dated July, 07, 20to which was accepted  by way of\n\ndeposit of fee, vide Pay order No.3L3t299, RBS Bank,  F-7\n\nBranch,  Islamabad.\n\n2.  Later ofl, petitioner received an offer from FAST\nUniversity to join its BS Program  on July, t9, 2010'\nPetitioner accepted the later offer and deposited  the dues\namounting to Rs.85,000/- on July 28, 2010 as FAST\n\nuniversity was the preferred  choice  of the petitioner from\nthe outset. The Father of petitioner, on Juty 29, 2010\n\nthrough an email addressed  to Mr. Nadeem-ud-din  Qureshi,\n\nAdditional  Registrar of Respondent  No.1 communicated the\n\n\flt'\n\nq\n\nW.P  No.415  o12011\n\n-2-\n\npetitioner's  decision to withdraw his acceptance of a place\n\nat COMSATS and sought refund of the fee who responded\n\nto same on July 31, 2010 refusing  refund of fee, on the\n\nground that no such practice\n\nIS\n\nprevalent at Institute,\n\npetitioner's  father, on August 04, 2010 served  a legal notice\n\non Respondent  No.1 demanding  reimbursement of fee, but\n\ndid not receive  response in affirmative, hence  instant\n\npetition.\n\n3.  The learned counsel for petitioner argued  that\n\npetitioner is an \"aggrieved  party\" within the meaning  of\n\nArticle 199 of the Constitution of Islamic  Republic of\n\nPakistan,  L973. Moreover,  petitioner brings the instant\nPetition before this court in the public interest, as\n\npromotion to the right of education and prohibition  of any\n\nunreasonable  restriction or restraint as policy and practice\n\nof Respondent No.1, is illegal, unreasonable and unfair\nwhich directly undermine  the Fundamental  Rights of\n\npetitioner and thousands of other students of the country.\n\n4.  The learned counsel added that when a petition  under\n\narticle 199 is instituted before the High Court in the public\ninterest, petitioner need not prove that he/she is an\n\naggrieved  party within the meaning of Article 199. The real\n\ntest in public interest litigation is the subject  matter of the\n\npetition or the abuse of public trust complained of. Once the\n\ncourt assesses that breach of trust and violation of law by a\n\n\fW.P No.415  of 2011\n\n-3-\n\npublic institution has taken place, the court must\nimmediately  proceed further to rectify the breach, the\n\nidentity  of antecedents of petitioner  pale into insignificance.\n\nMoreover,  with the development of new concept of public\n\ninterest Iitigation in the recent years, a person  can now\n\ninvoke the constitutional  jurisdiction of the superior courts,\n\neven if he is not an aggrieved  party as held by the superior\ncourts of the country in number of judgments.  In this\nregard Iearned  counsel placed his reliance  on 2010 pLD\n\nLahore 605, PLD 2009 Lahore 22,2007  MLD 999, pLD 2006\n\nSupreme  Court 394, 2000 CLC 47L",

Briefly,  the prosecution  story  as gleans out from the FIR is that\n\ncomplainant of the case  namely, Zeshan  Qasim moved an application to\n\nthe SHO,  P.S Shalimar,  lslamabad with the assertion that he is running\n\nthe business  of Travel & Tours  known as AL-DOHA  Travel  & Tours,  F-8,\n\nlslamabad.  Petitioner/accused  Abu Bakar Naveed  got executed  work\n\nworth  of Rs.49,92,OOOl-  through the office of complainant  and paid an\n\namount of Rs.17,55,OOO/-  in presence of one Naveed  Qasim,  whereas for\n\nremaining  amount, issued  postdated  cheques,  detail  given in the FIR is as\n\nunder:-\n\ni) \nCheque  No.0360456,  amounting  to Rs:500,000/-\niil  Cheque  No.0360457,  amounting  to Rs:500  OOI-\niii)  Cheque No.0360458,  amounting  to Rs:500,000/-\niv)  Cheque  No.0360461,  amounting  to Rs:20,87,000/-\nv)  Cheque  No.0360462,  amounting  to Rs:100,000/-\n\nAll cheques were to be drawn  at Bank-Alfalah,  Jamroad  Road,\n\nPeshawar  but same were dishonoured  on presentation'\n\n3.  Petitioner approached the \"Allaqa Judicial  Magistrate\" for grant  of\n\nbail but his request  was declined  vide order dated.15-12-2011.  Feeling\n\naggrieved,  petitioner  approached learned  Sessions  Judge, Islamabad  who\n\nentrusted  his bail petition to the learned Additional Sessions  Judge,\n\n\fCrl.  Misc.  No.71-B  ot 2012\n\n2\n\nlslamabad but petition  met the same fate, vide impugned order dated.O5-\n\n01-2012.  Resultantly,  petitioner  approached  this court for grant  of bail after\n\narrest.\n\n4.  As per contents  of the petition,  petitioner has been  implicated\n\nfalsely, cheques  were neither  issued  dishonestly, nor Same were issued  in\n\nfulfillment of any obligation, rather  were issued in a business deal, just as\n\na guarantee,  therefore, section  489-F  PPC, does not attract and that case\n\nof petitioner  is one of further inquiry.\n5.  Conversely, the learned counsel  for complainant  assisted by the\n\nlearned  standing  counsel,  opposed bail petition, mainly  on the ground  that\n\npetitioner  is also  involved in another  case of similar  nature, registered at\n\nP.S Ghazni, Peshawar,  vide FIR No.539  ol 2011. He further submits that\nissuance  of cheques is admitted and amount of cheques is heavy,\n\ntherefore, petition  is liable to be dismissed.\n\n6. \nI have heard  the learned counsel  for the pailies and have perused\nthe record. The plain reading  of Section  489-F PPC which  is being\n\nreproduced  herein  below, makes it abundantly  clear  that, three different\n\npunishments  are provided,  which obviously  in the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case can be inflicted as punishment upon any accused,  obviously\n\non the strength  of evidence  and data available  on the record.\n\n'n$&E:  Whoever  dishonestly  issues a cheque towards  r*payment\nof a loan or fulfiltment  of an obligation which  is dishonoured  on\npresentation,  shall be punishable with imprisonment  which may\nextend to three  years,  or with fine, or with both, unless  he can\nestablish, for which the burden of proof shall  rest on him, that  he\nhad made  arrangements with his bank to ensure  that  the cheque\nwoutd be honoured  and that  the bank  was at fault in not honouring\nthe cheque\".\nAs is evident from above,\n\n7\n\ni)\n\nii)\n\niii)\n\nlmprisonmentwhich  may  extend to 03 years.\n\nOR\nwith fine\nOR\nwith  both.\n\n\fCrl.  Misc.  No.71-B  ot 2012\n\n3\n\nThe provision  itself  provides  a right to an accused  to get himself  absolved,\n\nfrom the charge  by adducing  evidence that he made  arrangements with\n\nhis bank to ensure  that cheque  was to be honoured  and it was fault of the\n\nbank  not honouring  the cheque.\n\nL \n\nln my estimation, on the conclusion of trial despite finding any\n\naccused  guilty of an offence,  there is every likelihood/probability/possibility\n\nthat trial court may impose fine of a meager amount  of Rs:50/- only, as\n\npunishment. When asked from the learned  counsel  of complainant  that\n\nwhether  above  said possibility emerges  from this provision  itself or not?\n\nThe learned counsel very frankly answered in affirmative. ln such an\n\neventuality, to deprive  any person  from the concession  of bail is simply\n\nharsh  and unjust.\n\n9. \n\nlt is being  observed  that ever  since assertion  of Section  489-F PPC\n\nin the statue by Ordinance  LXXXV  of 2002,  dated.2S.10.2002 recovery\n\nproceedings  by way of filing  suits of summary  procedure  on negotiable\n\ninstruments,  provided  under order 37 CPC, almost have become  alien.\n\nCheque, which admittedly is a negotiable instrument, invariably being\n\nused for exerting pressure,  through device of criminal cases, although\n\nthere is no mechanism provided by the provision itself, to make it a\n\nrecovery mode. ln most of the cases relating to cheques, criminal\n\nproceeding  are being used as a tool to compel  the family  members of an\n\naccused to arrange  the amount,  which results into penalizing the entire\n\nfamily  for the wrong,  if any of one person. There is no doubt that when\n\nallegation of fraud, conclude in to the guilt of any accused person, he can\n\nbe awarded punishment  for the same,  but to punish the entire  family\n\nbefore finding  of guilt is recorded and that too for an offence, which\n\nprovides alternate punishment  of fine only, to my mind is against all\ncannons of justice and golden  principle  of \"dW))t))9\".\n10.  It is well settled law with the mandate  of the dictums  of the Superior\n\nCourts  of the country that law has to be stretched  in favour of accused  and\n\n\fCrl.  Misc.  No.71-B  ol 20'12\n\n4\n\nbeneficial interpretation  has to be made in his favour.  When there  is\n\nremoter possibility,  that an accused may not be awarded imprisonment  of\n\neven one month then propriety demands  that discretion has to be\n\nexercised in his favour.  Now,  coming  to the other extreme  that,  maximum\n\npunishment  for offence provided  is up to 03 years, which does  not fall\n\nwithin  the prohibitory  clause of Section 497",

In-\n\nappeal, the judgment and decree of the learned trial Court was modified \n\nto the extent that period of maintenance for minor was fixed from July, \n\n2017  instead  of  March,  2017  with    10%  annual  increase  till  his  legal \n\nentitlement.  \n\n2- \n\nThe  learned  counsel  argued  that  the  quantum  of  maintenance \n\ndetermined  and  fixed  for  the  minor  does  not  commensurate  with  the \n\nfinancial position of the petitioner whose monthly income is Rs. 16193/- \n\nand in such meager amount, has to maintain his other wife and mother as \n\nwell;  that  both  the  learned  Courts  failed  to  appreciate  the  affidavit  Ex. \n\nD/4  sworn  by  the  respondent  No.1  in  its  true  perspective  and  that  the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fWP  No. 1734-2021 \n\n- 2- \n\nimpugned  judgments  and  decrees  being  against  the  law  and  facts  are \n\nliable to be set aside.  \n\n3. \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  No.1 \n\nrepelled  the  above  submissions  by  contending  that  there  are  concurrent \n\nfindings on facts by the two learned Courts, that the claim of respondent \n\nNo.1  for  the  recovery  of  dower,  dowry  articles  and  maintenance \n\nallowance  has  been  established  through  un-rebutted  evidence  therefore, \n\npetition is liable to be dismissed.    \n\n4. \n\nHeard, record examined.  \n\n5. \n\nPerusal of record reveals that the marriage between the petitioner \n\nand  respondent  No.  1  was  solemnized  in  October,  2009.

        "Summary": ". \n\n======================================== \n\nBABAR SATTAR, J.- Through this judgment this Court \n\nwill  decide  Writ  Petition  No.3363  of  2021  and  Writ  Petition \n\nNo.2134  of  2020.  For  purposes  of  this  judgment,  Muhammad \n\nJehanzeb Abbasi, the petitioner in Writ Petition No.3363 of 2021 \n\nand  respondent  No.1  in  Writ  Petition  No.2134  of  2020,  will  be \n\naddressed  as  Petitioner  and  Mst.  Naima  Akhtar  Abbasi,  the \n\npetitioner in Writ Petition No.2134 of 2020 and respondent No.1 \n\nin  Writ  Petition  No.3363  of  2021,  will  be  addressed  as \n\nRespondent. \n\n2. \n\nThe  Respondent  filed  Writ  Petition  No.2134  of  2020 \n\nimpugning  the  order  of  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  dated \n\n25.02.2020,  pursuant  to  which  an  application  filed  by  the \n\nPetitioner for setting  aside ex-parte judgment and  decree dated \n\n18.02.2019  was  allowed  by  holding  that  a  partial  ex-parte \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 3363/2021 \n\nP a g e  | 2 \n\njudgment  and  decree  in  favor  of  the  Respondent  dated \n\n22.03.2018 would stand. The Respondent has impugned the said \n\norder  before  this  Court  without  availing  the  remedy  of  appeal \n\nbefore  the  learned  District  Court.  The  Petitioner  has  impugned \n\norder  dated  25.02.2020  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family \n\nCourt  and  the  order-in-appeal  dated  23.06.2021  passed  by  the \n\nlearned  Additional  District  Court,  whereby  the  order  passed  by \n\nthe learned Judge Family Court was upheld. \n\n3. \n\nThe  relevant  facts  are  that  the  Petitioner  and  the \n\nRespondent  are  married  and  the  Respondent  filed  a  suit  for \n\nrecovery of maintenance and dower against the Petitioner before \n\nthe  learned  Judge  Family  Court  in  Islamabad.  The  proceedings \n\ncontinued  against  the  Petitioner  ex-parte  in  Family  Suit  No.251 \n\nof  2017  and  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  dated  22.03.2018 \n\nwere  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court.    Aggrieved  by \n\nsuch  judgment  and  decree  the  Petitioner  filed  an  appeal  before \n\nthe  learned  Additional  District  Court,  which  was  partially \n\naccepted  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Court  by  judgment \n\ndated  01.12.2018  and  the  matter  was  remanded  back  to  the \n\nlearned  Judge  Family  Court  for  decision  on  the  question  of \n\nmaintenance and dower afresh. The learned Judge Family Court \n\ncontinued  to  proceed  against  the  Petitioner  ex-parte  and  after \n\nhearing  the  ex-parte  arguments  of  the  Respondent  passed \n\nanother  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  dated  18.02.2019.  The \n\nPetitioner  then  filed  two  applications  one  for  setting  aside  the  \n\nex-parte judgment and decree dated 22.03.2018 and the second \n\nfor  setting  aside  the  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  dated \n\n18.02.2019.  The  learned  Judge  Family  Court  accepted  the \n\n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 3363/2021 \n\nP a g e  | 3 \n\nPetitioner\u2019s  application  for  setting  aside  ex-parte  judgment  and \n\ndecree  dated  18.02.2019  on  the  basis  that  after  remand  of  the \n\nmatter  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Court  the  learned \n\nFamily Court had issued no fresh summons to the Petitioner and \n\nconsequently,  the  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  had  been \n\npassed  without  serving  any  notice  on  the  Petitioner.  The \n\nPetitioner\u2019s  application  for  setting  aside  ex-parte  judgment  and \n\ndecree  dated  22.03.2018  was,  however,  dismissed  on  the  basis \n\nthat  the  application  did  not  state  how  the  Petitioner  came  to \n\nknow about the ex-parte judgment and decree, which led to the \n\nfiling  of  the  application  twenty  months  after  the  ex-parte \n\njudgment  and  decree  was  passed  on  22.03.2018.  The  learned \n\nAdditional District Court found that the address of the Petitioner \n\nas  mentioned  in  the  suit  was  that  of  his  family  home  also \n\nmentioned on the  Nikahnama and the Petitioner could therefore \n\nnot assert that he had no knowledge of the proceedings pending \n\nbefore the learned Family Court. It also upheld the reasoning of \n\nthe learned Judge Family Court that the Petitioner did not clearly \n\nplead  how  he  came  to  know  that  the  ex-parte  judgment  and \n\ndecree  had  been  passed  and  concluded  that  the  Petitioner  had \n\ndodged  the  service  and  was  silently  observing  the  proceedings \n\nand  now  come  to  the  Court  seeking  setting  aside  of  the \n\njudgment and decree. \n\n4. \n\nThe  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that \n\nthe  Petitioner  had  been  living  in  Ireland  since  2015  and  at  the \n\ntime  when  the  suit  was  filed  by  the  Respondent,  the  Petitioner \n\nwas  not  in  Pakistan.  This  fact  was  also  revealed  by  the \n\nRespondent  herself  in  her  plaint.  There  was  no  report  that  the \n\n \n \n\fWrit Petition No. 3363/2021 \n\nP a g e  | 4 \n\nPetitioner  had  been  served  and  in  the  absence  of  any  record  of \n\nservice on the Petitioner, the learned Judge Family Court decided \n\nto  proceed  against  him  as  ex-parte.  The  decision  to  proceed \n\nagainst  the  Petitioner  ex-parte  was  taken  without  affecting \n\nservice  in  accordance  with  Order  V  of  the  Code  of  Civil \n\nProcedure, 1908",

Though, learned counsel for the respondent \n\nhas  vigorously  contested  the  application  yet  in \n\norder  to  decide  the  controversy  once  for  all,  it \n\nwould  be  in  the  interest  of  justice  that  the \n\napplicant  should  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to \n\npresent his case.  \n\n6. \n\nAt this juncture, it is necessary to mention \n\nthat due to pendancy of the instant writ petition, \n\nthe proceedings in a family suit filed way back in \n\n2011 are at-halt due to injunctive order.  \n\n7. \n\nIt  is  clarified  that  no  further  adjournment \n\non  any  account  to  any  of  the  party  shall  be \n\ngranted and in case the petitioner fails to ensure \n\nthe  presence  of  his  representation  on  the  next \n\ndate of hearing the matter shall finally be decided \n\non the basis of material available on record.  \n\n8. \n\nThe  instant  application  is  allowed.  Order \n\ndated  30.09.2020  is  recalled  and  the  main \n\npetition  is  restored  to  its  original  number.  Let  it \n\nbe fixed on 26.09.2022.  \n\nA.R.ANSARI*",

The \n\nlearned  counsel  has \n\nfurther  submitted  that  financial  strength  of \n\nRespondent  No.  3/father  is  visible  from  the \n\namounts paid by him as interim maintenance. \n\nIn \n\nthis  regard, \n\nlearned  counsel \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nPetitioner  has  drawn  attention  of  this  Court \n\ntowards the diary sheets available on page Nos. \n\n58 to 67 which show the detail of the amounts \n\npaid  by  Respondent  No.  3  to  the  Petitioners. \n\nHowever,  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  is \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\funable  to  explain  why  different  amounts  were \n\nbeing  paid  by  the  father/Respondent  No.  3, \n\neach time.  \n\n2.  As  per  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner \n\nthe  varying  amount  represent  arrears  of  the \n\ninterim maintenance. However, he is unable to \n\npoint out the order by way of which the interim \n\nmaintenance  was  fixed,  therefore,  it  cannot  be \n\nascertained  whether  such  amounts  represent \n\narrears  or  not.

That  rukhsati  did  not  take \n\nplace  and  respondent  No.1  divorced  the  petitioner  pursuant  to \n\ndivorce  deed  dated  25.01.2018.  That  according  to  the  marriage \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n\fW.P 2784/2021 \n\nP a g e  | 2 \n\ndeed  the  petitioner  was  entitled  to  Haq  Mehr  in  the  amount  of \n\nRs.5,000/-  in  cash  and  15  tolas  of  gold.  That  Rs.5,000/-  cash \n\namount was paid at the time of execution of the marriage deed. \n\nBut 15 tolas of gold was remained unpaid, for which purpose the \n\npetitioner  filed  the  suit  that  was  decreed  by  the  learned  Judge \n\nFamily Court on 27.01.2021 ordering respondent No.1 to pay 7.5 \n\ntolas of gold to the petitioner. That the learned Additional District \n\nJudge  set-aside  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the  learned  Family \n\nCourt  through  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  on  the  basis \n\nthat the Special Attorney appearing on behalf of respondent No.1 \n\nhad  stated  during  cross-examination  that  the  amount  of \n\nRs.5,000/- and 15 tolas of gold were paid to the petitioner at the \n\ntime  of  execution  of  the  marriage  deed.  And  as  the  petitioner \n\nhad  not  controverted  the  contention  by  any  suggestion  in \n\nrebuttal,  such  contention  would  be  deemed  to  be  accepted  and \n\nconsequently  respondent  No.1  was  not  liable  to  pay  anything \n\nhaving  taken  the  position  that  the  entire  amount  of  Haq  Mehr \n\nhad  already  been  paid.  He  submitted  that  pursuant  to  the \n\nmarriage  deed,  the  15  tolas  of  gold  was  deferred  dower  and  as \n\nrukhsati  never \n\ntook  place  and \n\nthe  marriage  was  not \n\nconsummated there was no occasion for respondent No.1 to pay \n\nthe dower to the petitioner. He contended that other than a bald \n\nstatement  made  during  cross-examination  there  was  no \n\nevidence that 15 tolas of gold specified as deferred dower in the \n\nmarriage deed was ever paid to the petitioner.  \n\n3. \n\nLearned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  submitted  that \n\nBarim  Maqsood  Raja",

        "Summary": ".  Syed Tahir Abbas, Advocate for the Petitioner. \n\nThrough the instant petition, the Petitioner \n\nhas  assailed  judgment  dated  29.11.2021  passed \n\nby  learned  Additional  District  Judge-I,  East-\n\nIslamabad,  whereby  appeal  against  ex-parte \n\njudgment & Decree, dated 07.11.2019, passed by \n\nlearned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III,  East-Islamabad \n\nhas been dismissed.  \n\n2. \n\nLearned  counsel  has,  inter-alia,  contended \n\nthat  the  impugned  orders  have  been  passed  on \n\nthe basis of misreading and non-reading; that the \n\nimpugned  judgments  are  based  on  conjectures \n\nand  surmises;  that  the  impugned  judgments  are \n\nliable to be set to give a chance of fair trial to the \n\nPetitioner.  \n\n3. \n\n4. \n\n Arguments heard. Record perused.  \n\nUpon  inquiry,  learned  counsel  for  the \n\nPetitioner  has  admitted  that  address  of  the \n\nPetitioner,  as  given \n\nin  the  proceedings/suit \n\npending  before  the  learned  Family  Court,  is \n\nindeed  correct.  Learned  counsel  has  also \n\n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n\f2 | W . P   N o .   2 0 1 / 2 0 2 2  \n\nconfirmed  that  the  publication  was  made  in  the \n\nsuit.  Furthermore  it  is  also  admitted  that  the \n\nPetitioner actually entered appearance before the \n\nlearned  trial  Court  on  one  date  but  thereafter \n\nremained  absent  and  ex-parte  judgment  and \n\ndecree was passed.  \n\n5. \n\nPerusal  of  the  impugned  judgment  dated \n\n29.11.2021  shows  that  the  Petitioner/Appellant \n\nwas in knowledge about pendency of the suit and \n\nhimself  requested  for  adjournment  for  engaging \n\nhis  counsel  as  well  as  for  submission  of  written \n\nstatement.  Relevant  portion  of  the  impugned \n\njudgment for is also reproduced hereunder:- \n\n9. \n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026.the \n\nlearned  Trial  Court \n\nissued \n\nsummon, which was duly served on 22.07.2019 \n\nand  his  signatures  had  also  been  obtained  on \n\nback  of  summon.  On  23.07.2019,  present \n\nPetitioner put his appearance before the learned \n\nTrial  Court  and  his  signatures  with  thumb \n\nimpression  have  also  been  obtained  on  the \n\nmargin of order sheet. Thereafter, the case was \n\nadjourned  to  16.09.2019  for  submission  of \n\nwakalatnama  as  well  as  written  statement, \n\nhowever,  on  next  date  i.e  16.09.2019,  despite \n\nrepeated calls, present Petitioner did not appear \n\nbefore \n\nthe  Court  and  resultantly,  ex-parte \n\nproceedings  were  initiated  against  him.  Order \n\nsheet  of  learned  Trail  Court  clearly  depicts  that \n\npresent  appellant  was  in  well  knowledge  about \n\npendency  of  suit  and  he  himself  requested  for \n\nan adjournment for engaging his counsel as well \n\nas  for  submission  of  written  statement  and  the \n\nlearned  trial  Court  Adjourned  the  case  on  the \n\nrequest  of  present  Petitioner.  However,  on  next \n\ndate,  the  present  Petitioner  malafidely  did  not \n\nappear before the Court.\u201d. \n\n \n \n\f3 | W . P   N o .   2 0 1 / 2 0 2 2  \n\nIt  is  pertinent  to  mention  that  the  above  said \n\nfacts  mentioned  in  the  impugned  judgment  have \n\nnot been controverted by the learned counsel for \n\nthe Petitioner. \n\n6. \n\nIn  the  above  circumstances  and  candid \n\nadmission  made  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \n\nPetitioner before this Court, it is crystal clear that \n\nimpugned  judgments  do  not  suffer  from  any \n\nillegality  or \n\nirregularity  and  warrants  no \n\ninterference  of  this  Court  in  exercise  of  its \n\nconstitutional  Jurisdiction.  Hence  the  petition  in \n\nhand stands dismissed in limine.  \n\nsherazi",

It  was  further  contended  that  the \n\nimpugned  order  is  untenable  inasmuch  as  is  in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fW.P.

In  this  behalf  the  marriage  was \n\ndissolved by way of Khula subject to restoration \n\nof  dower.  Learned counsel for the petitioner has \n\nnot been able to provide any plausible reason for \n\ncondoning  the  delay  in  approaching  this  Court. \n\nThe petition, under Article 199 of Constitution of \n\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is by way \n\nof equitable remedy and it is established principle \n\nthat  equity  favours  the  vigilant  rather  than \n\nindolent.
