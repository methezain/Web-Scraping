Proceedings 
07.02.2022  Khawaja  Hasan  Riaz,  Advocate 

for 

the

Through  the  instant  petition,  the

decree dated 27.09.2021, passed by learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge), 

West-Islamabad  as  well  as  judgment  and 

decree dated 13.12.2021, passed by learned 

Additional  District 

Judge 

(MCAC)-West, 

Islamabad,  whereby  appeal  filed  by  the 

petitioners  was  dismissed.  The  petitioners 

are  also  aggrieved  regarding  fixation  of  the 

schedule of visitation between the parties. 

 2. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

petitioners,  inter-alia,  contends  that  it  is 

categorically  mentioned  by  the  learned  Trial 

Court 

in  para  No.30  of  the 

impugned 

judgment  that  father  of  minor  /  respondent 

No.1  has  failed  to  provide  past  maintenance 

to  the  minor  /  petitioner  No.2  but  in  the 

concluding  para  no  relief  regarding  payment 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
of  past  maintenance  has  been  granted  and 

suit  has  been  partially  dismissed,  impugned 

judgments and decrees to the extent of non-

entitlement  of  past  maintenance  and 

schedule  of  visitation  rights  are  erroneous 

and  are  not  tenable  under  the  law,  hence 

liable to be set-aside.
