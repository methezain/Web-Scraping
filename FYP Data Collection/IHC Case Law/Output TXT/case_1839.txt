Raja Bilal Farooq Kiyani,  Advocate for the petitioner.
Mr. Adil AzizQazi, Advocate for respondent No.2.
Ms. Saima  Naqvi,  State Counsel.
Muhammad  Rasheed,  S.I, P.S Aabpar4 Islamabad.

Through this petition,  the petitioner  has applied for post

arrest bail in case FIR No.326l18,  dated  09.09.2018,  U/S

3241  4521337-D  PPC,  P.S Aabpara,  Islamabad.

2.  Brief  facts are that  the above  referred  FIR was lodged by

respondent  No.2/complainant  with the allegations that on

08.09.2018, at about 7:55 p.m, Saeed Mumtaz  Durani,  ex-

husband of sister in law of respondent  No.2 visited  his house

No.l3,Street No.38,  Sector  G-6-ll3,Islamabad  and when his son

Abdul  Ahad Faisal  opened  the door on door bell, Saeed  Mumtaz

Durani  fired  upon him but he rescued  himself  while entering  into

his house. Saeed  Mumtaz  Durani  forcefully  entered in the house

and fired upon wife of respondent  No.2fuzma  Faisal and there-

after fled away from the scene in Honda Civic No.IDN-7329.

The motive  of the said incident is family dispute of Saeed

Mumtaz  Durani with ex-wife/sister  in law of respondent No.2.

3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends  that the

petitioner  is innocent  and has falsely  been implicated  in this  case;

that the petitioner  was  arrested on 12.10.2018,  challan has been

submiffed  in the Court, even  evidence of major witresses  has

2

been recorded and  there is no apprehension  of tampering with

prosecution  evidence  and no useful  purpose  would  be served

while  keeping  the petitioner  behind the bars, who is languishing

in jail for the last eight  months.

4.  Conversely,  learned counsel for respondent No.2  and

learned  State  Counsel  contend  that the petitioner has  been

charged with direct  role of causing  fire arm injuries  to the lady,

who has nothing  to do with the family dispute;  that the offence

falls within  prohibitory clause  of section 497 Cr.P.C and the tial

is about to conclude.

5.  I have  heard  the arguments and perused  the record.

6.  From perusal of the record, it has been observed  that the

petitioner  has been charged  with  direct role of causing  two fire

arms injuries to Uzma  Faisal,  sister in law of respondent No.2 on

08.09.2018,  at about  7:55 p.m while entering into House No.l3,

Street No.38, Sector G-6-ll3,Islamabad  by force.

7.  It also  reveals from the contents of the FIR that the

petitioner  also fired upon Abdul  Hahad,  son of respondent No.2.

Weapon of offence  has already been recovered  from the

petitioner.  The  challan  has been submitted before the Court,

charged  has been framed on0L.04.2019 and at present statements

of three star witnesses have been recorded  and only two

witresses are left to be examined.

8.  Keeping  in view above  background,  prima facie the

petitioner  is connected with commission of heinous  crime of

causing  grievous hurt to Unna Faisal, whose  medical  certificate

reveals  that  four injuries have  been caused and she remained  in

the hospital for considerable  period and  the nature of injuries  has

been referred  as Jurh Jaifah  (Cavity deep). In such type of

3

circumstances,  it is appropriate  to issue  direction  to learned Trial

Court to conclude the trial within specific  period while relyrng

upon 20LI SCMR 1332  (Rehmat Ullah VS The State and

anotherl.

9.  For what has been discussed  above, the petitioner is not

entitled  for concession  of post arest bail, therefore,  instant

petition stands dismissed. However, learned Trial Court  seized

with the matter is directed to conclude  the trial on or before

31.12.2019 under intimation  to this Court.
