Proceedings 

07.09.2021  Hafiz Farman Ullah, Advocate for petitioner.  

Ch.  Adnan  Qamar,  Advocate  for  respondents 
No.1 to 5. 

Respondent  No.1  filed a suit for recovery 

of  maintenance  for  herself  and  minor  children 

namely respondent Nos.2 to 5 along with dower 

in  shape  of  15-tola  gold.  The  said  suit  was 

decreed in favour of respondent Nos.1 to 5 vide 

judgment  dated  25.01.2018.  The  petitioner 

appealed  before  respondent  No.6  and  the  said 

appeal  was  dismissed  vide 

judgment  dated 

25.09.2018 and under the same, respondent No.1 

was  held 

to  be  entitled  for  recovery  of 

maintenance  for  the  period  of  Iddat  @  Rs.8000 

per  month  and  for  respondent  Nos.2  to  5,  sum 

of  Rs.6000  each  per  month  and  claim  to  the 

extent  of  15-tola  gold,  was  turned  down,  hence 

the petition. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia 

contended  that  grant  of  maintenance  to  the 

children @ Rs.6000 per month is exorbitant and 

not  in  line  with  the  evidence.  When  confronted 

as  to  misreading  or  non-reading  of  evidence  or 

any legal flaw with respect to judgment for grant 

of  maintenance, 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner was unable to point out any.

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent  Nos.1  to 

5 inter alia contended that petitioner has not paid 

single penny towards maintenance.       

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  learned  counsel 

for 

the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

the 

documents,  placed  on  record,  examined  with 

their able assistance.  

5. 

The  facts,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petition,  have  been  mentioned  hereinabove 

therefore need not be reproduced. 

6. 

The  judgment  of  the  learned  appellate 

court  is  well  reasoned,  as  same  provides  cogent 

grounds  for  fixation  of  maintenance  as  well  as 

turning down the claim of petitioner for return of 

15-tola  gold.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

was  unable  to  point  out  any  infirmity  in  the 

impugned  judgment,  which  as  stated  above,  is 

well reasoned and does not suffer from any error 

of law or jurisdiction.  

7. 

For  what  has  been  stated  above,  instant 

petition  is  without  merit  and  is  accordingly 

dismissed.
