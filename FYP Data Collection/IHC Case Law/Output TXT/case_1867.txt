Order  with  signature  of Judge  and that of parties  or counsel 

where  necessa

Chaudhary  Muhammad Jahangir  and Mr. Mohsin 
Khan Abbasi, Advocates for respondent  No.2. 

. 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioners  impugn  the  order  dated  26.06.2018, 

passed  by  the  learned  Judge,  Family  Court, 

Islamabad, whereby  the  petitioners'  application 

for summoning the owner of the security  company 

(where respondent No.2 is employed) along with 

the record of all other employees, was dismissed. 

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioners 

submitted that  the  monthly maintenance fixed by 

the  learned  Family  Court  was  Rs. 7 ,500/-  for 

petitioner  No.1  and  respondent  No.2's  three 

children; that the said amount was too meager to 

sustain  three  young  children;  that  respondent 

No.2's  income  is  more  than  enough  to  pay 

Rs.10,000/- per  month  for  each  of  his  children; 

and 

that 

the 

record  of 

respondent  No.2's 

employer  was  essential  to  be  examined by  the 

learned Trial  Court  for  the just  determination  of 

monthly maintenance for the petitioners. 

3.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.2  submitted  that  the  impugned 

order  dated 26.06.2018 is interlocutory  in nature, 

and 

therefore,  cannot  be  assailed 

in 

the 

Constitutional jurisdiction  of  this  Court;  that  the 

instant  petition  was  filed  only  to  protract  the 

litigation  before the  learned Trial  Court; that  the 

case is being adjourned for  final  arguments over 

2 

1//1 

W.P.No.4172/2018 

several  dates  of  hearing  stretching  over  six 

months;  and that  the  petitioners  have concealed 

this fact  by not filing  the  complete  order  sheet of 

the  learned  Trial  Court.  Learned  counsel  for 

respondent No.2 prayed for  the writ  petition to be 

dismissed. 

4. 

I  have heard the contentions  of the  learned 

counsel for the contesting  parties. 

5. 

Since 

the 

impugned 

order 

dated 

26.06.2018, passed by the  learned Judge,  Family 

Court,  is an interlocutory  order,  I  am not inclined 

to  go  into  the  merits  of  the  case  lest  it  may 

prejudice the petitioners'  case during the trial. 

6. 

As  Section  14(3)  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act,  1964, expressly bars a right  of 

appeal  or  revision  against  an  interim  order 

passed  by  a  Family  Court,  the  same  cannot  be 

circumvented  by  challenging  such  an  interim 

order  in the Constitutional jurisdiction  of the  High 

Court. A party aggrieved by such an interim order 

has  to  wait  until  a  Family  Court  passes  a  final 

order  and then to challenge it in an appeal. This is 

because  an  interim  order  merges  into  the  final 

verdict.  The purpose behind barring  an appeal or 

a revision  against  an  interim  order  of  the  Family 

Court is to avoid delays in disposal of the cases by 

the  Family Court.  Since the  suit  instituted  by the 

petitioners  are  for  recovery  of  maintenance,  the 

final  decree  that  may  be  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge,  Family Court  would  be  appealable  under 

Section 14 of the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 

1964.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  be  made to 

the following  case law:- 

(i) 

In the case of Sved Saghir Ahmad Naqvi VS 

Province  of Sindh  (1996 SCMR 1165), it has 

been held as follows:- 

3 

I)/(? 

W .P .No.4172/2018 

"The  statute  excluding  a  right  of 
appeal from  the interim  order  cannot 
be  passed  by  bringing  under  attack 
such  interim  orders  in  Constitutional 
jurisdiction.  The party  affected  has to 
wait  till  it  matures  into  a  final  order 
and  then  to  attack  it  in  the  proper 
exclusive 
the 
forum  created 
purpose of examining such orders." 

for 

(ii) 

In the  case  of  Mumtaz Hussain alias  Butta 

VS  Chief  Administrator  of  Auqaf.  Punjab 

(1976  SCMR 450),  it  has  been  held  as 

follows:- 

'~s  the said  Ordinance has  taken away 
the  right  of  petitioner 
to  interim  relief, 
learned counsel submitted  that this was a 
ground  which  entitled  the  petitioner  to 
prosecute  a  writ  petition  despite  the 
pendency  of  the  proceedings  on  the 
is 
District  Court.  The  argument 
misconceived 
writ 
jurisdiction  of the superior  Courts cannot 
be invoked in aid of injustice and in order 
to  defeat  the  express provisions  of  the 
statutory  law. ,, 

because 

the 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Mst.  Maham  Shabbir  VS 

Salman Haider (2014  CLC 330), the  Hon'ble 

Islamabad High Court held as follows:- 

revision. 

''9.  . . .  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its  writ 
is  not  sitting  as  a  Court  of 
jurisdiction 
Its 
appeal,  or  court  of 
jurisdiction 
to  interfere  on  the  point  of 
fact  is limited. Interlocutory  order  if does 
not suffer  from any illegality,  malafide or 
is not  in  excess of jurisdiction  or  lack  of 
exercise of jurisdiction  or  not  based  on 
misreading, misconstruing  or  discarding 
of  the  evidence and  material  on  record 
cannot  be  challenged  in  constitutional 
jurisdiction.  Nevertheless,  the  facts  of 
each  case  are 
to  be  considered 
separately and  no  uniform principle  can 
be  determined  for  exercising  the  writ 
jurisdiction.,, 

7. 

It is my view that exceptional circumstances 

which could justify  invoking the jurisdiction  of the 

High Court  under  Article  199 of  the  Constitution 

would  be when the  order  or  action  assailed was 

palpably  without  jurisdiction,  malafide,  void  or 

4 

W.P.No.4172/2018 

coram-non-jud/ce.  The  order  impugned  in  this 

petition is clearly interlocutory  in nature and does 

not dispose of  the  entire  case  before  the  Family 

Court.  The  impugned  order  is  neither  without 

jurisdiction  nor  malafide,  void  or  coram-non  

judice  so  as  to  warrant 

interference 

in  the 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under 

Article  199 of the Constitution. 

8. 

The  order  dated  26.06.2018  being  purely 

interlocutory  in nature  could  not be subjected to 

challenge by filing  a Constitutional petition before 

this  Court  as  it  would  amount  to  defeating  the 

legislative intent behind Section 14(3) of the West 

Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964. Therefore, I  am 

not  inclined  to  interfere  in the  said  interlocutory 

order  passed by the learned Judge, Family Court. 

9. 

Since  I  do  not  find  the  pre-requisites  for 

interference  in  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction  of 

this  Court  with 

the 

impugned  order  dated 

26.06.2018 to be satisfied in the case at hand, the 

instant  writ  petition 

is  dismissed  as  not 

maintainable. The  petitioner  will  be  at  liberty  to 

challenge the  said  order  dated  26.06.2018 in  an 

appeal  against  the  final  order  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  if  the  occasion 

arises for  doing so. There shall be no order  as to 

costs.
