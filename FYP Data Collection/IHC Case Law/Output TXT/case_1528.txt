By way  of this  common  order,  I  intend  to decide

2. 

In  Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019, 

the  petitioner 

Mehboob  Ali has  prayed  for  release  of vehicle  No.  LES- 

2288, Toyota  Hi-ace,  Model  2007  on  the  ground  that  he 

being 

registered  owner  of  subject  vehicle 

(copy  of 

registration  book  has  been  produced  to  substantiate  his 

claim),  hence,  he  is  entitled  for  superdari  of  vehicle  and 

that  both  the  forums  below  have  not  considered 

this 

aspect  and  refused 

the  application 

for  superdari  in 

Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019  &  69/M/2020 

2 

violation  of  settled  law;  that  FIR  though  was  got 

registered  by one Ghulam  Murtaza,  who  was  purchaser 

of said vehicle and  petitioner  has  sold  out  the  vehicle to 

said  Ghulam  Murtaza  when  vehicle  was  reportedly 

stolen  from  territorial  jurisdiction  of  P.S.  Margalla, 

Islamabad. 

3. 

In Crl. Misc. No.69-M/2020,  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  Zarnosh  Khan  contends  that  petitioner  is 

also  purchaser  of  said  vehicle  against  the  total  sale 

consideration  of Rs.26,50,000/- on  installment  basis and 

has paid  an  amount  of Rs.5,00,000/- through  agreement 

dated  24.03.2015, but said  vehicle was  stolen  which was 

later  on  recovered  and  Mehboob  Ali  has  snatched  the 

said  vehicle  from  petitioner  forcibly;  that  said  vehicle 

was  seen  by  petitioner  at  Faisal  Masjid,  whereby  he 

informed  the  police  regarding  the  said  vehicle  but 

respondent  No.3/Ghulam  Murtaza  successfully  got 

lodged  the  FIR No.163,  dated  03.09.2019, U/S  381-A/34 

PPC,  P.S. Margalla,  Islamabad  and  petitioner  has  been 

nominated  as  accused  in  the  said  FIR; that  cross  civil 

suits  are  pending  before  the  competent  civil court  qua 

the  eligibility and  entitlement  of vehicle  in  question,  as 

such  learned  trial  Court  as  well  as  learned  Revisional 

Court  have  not  considered  all  these  aspects  and 

dismissed  the application  in mechanical  fashion. 

4. 

5. 

Arguments  heard,  record  perused. 

Perusal  of record  reveals  that  FIR No.163, dated 

03.09.2019, U/S  381-A/34  PPC, P.S. Margalla,  Islamabad 

Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019  & 69/M/2020

was 

lodged 

on 

the 

complaint 

of  Ghulam 

Murtaza/respondent  No.3  with  the  contention  that  he 

alongwith  family  came  from  Sara-e-Alamgir  to  Faisal 

Masjid  on  subject  vehicle  No.LES-2288, Toyota  Hi-ace 

and  same was stolen from parking  area when  he went to 

drink  water  from  nearby  water  cooler.  He  nominated 

Zarnosh  Khan  and  three  unknown  persons  as  accused 

in the FIR, whereby  I.O got recovered  the subject vehicle 

from said Zarnosh  Khan, petitioner  in Crl. Misc. No.69- 

M/2020.  The  vehicle  in  question  was  recovered  on  his 

pointation  and  at this stage, LO present  before the Court 

has  confirmed  that  challan  has  been  submitted  in  the 

Court  against  Zarnosh  Khan and  trial  is pending  before 

the competent court. 

6. 

Similarly,  it  has  not  been  denied  by  the  I.O  as 

well  as  by  all  the  parties  present  before  the  court  that 

vehicle in question  is registered  in the name of Mehboob 

Ali,  petitioner  in  Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019  and  as  such 

registration  book  appended  with  this  petition  confirms 

the  stance,  however,  petitioner  Mehboob  Ali conceded 

that  he  has  sold  out  the  vehicle  and  same  was  with 

Ghulam  Murtaza/respondent  No.3  and  as  such 

petitioner  Mehboob  Ali has  no  claim  except  that  he  is 

registered  owner.  There  is  also  no  denial  regarding 

pendency  of  civil  suits  before  the  Court  of  Mr.  Zahid 

Tirmazi, Civil Judge (West), Islamabad. 

7. 

Keeping  in  view  the  above  divergent  stance  of 

the  parties  qua  the  vehicle in  question  whereby  parties 

Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019  &  69/M/2020 

4 

have  claimed  the  vehicle  through  their  cross  suits  and 

even  nominated  accused  Zarnosh  Khan  is  also  rival 

claimant. In this backdrop,  this Court  is of the view that 

parties  have  already  agitated  their  matter  before  the 

competent  civil court  having  jurisdiction  in  this  regard 

and  any  decision  at  this  stage  might  affect the  case  of 

either  party,  especially  when  criminal  case  is  pending 

qua  the  stolen  vehicle,  therefore,  it  is  appropriate  that 

direction be issued  to all the concerned  courts  including 

civil court  as well  as  criminal  court  to  adjudicate  upon 

the matter  on the basis of respective  pleas  and  evidence 

of parties  as  all  parties  are  claiming  their  rights  on  the 

basis  of  certain  documents  which  could  not  be 

appreciated  by this Court,  which  requires  recording  of 

evidence.  Hence, 

instant 

criminal  miscellaneous 

petitions are disposed  of with direction  to the trial Court 

to  conclude  the  trial  on  or  before  30.06.2021 and  shall 

decide  the  fate  of vehicle bearing  No.LES-2288, Toyota 

I Ii-ace,  Model  2007  after  recording  of  evidence. 

Similarly, learned  Civil Court  seized with  the cross suits 

is  directed  to  decide  the  suits  on  or  before  30.06.2021. 

However,  orders  so  passed  by  learned  trial  Court  as 

well  as  learned  Revisional  Court  will  not  effect  the 

rights  of respective  parties.  However,  it  is important  to 

mention  here  that  Mehboob Ali has  conceded  his claim 

in favour of Ghulam Murtaza, whose  application 

for  superdari  of  vehicle  in  question  has  already  been 

turned  down  by the  trial Court  and  as  such  he  has  not 

Crl.  Misc.  No.773/2019  &  69/M/2020 

5 

assailed  the  same  further,  therefore,  he  may  approach 

the  trial  Court  afresh  while  referring  the  stance  of 

Mehboob Ali, registered  owner  of vehicle in question,  if 

so advised.
