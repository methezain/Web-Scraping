Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel 
where necessary. 

The  order  sheet  reveals  that  on  the 

previous  date  of  hearing  (i.e.  14.10.2020),  no 

one  had  tendered  appearance  on  behalf  of  the 

petitioners.

Today,  the  case  was  called  on  its  turn  as 

well  as  before  the  rising  of  the  Court,  but  on 

both  occasions,  no  one  tendered  appearance 

for  the  petitioners.  Therefore,  the  instant  writ 

petition is dismissed for non-prosecution.
