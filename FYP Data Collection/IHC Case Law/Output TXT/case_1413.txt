Petitioner in person.  

Petitioner  has  assailed  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 

09.11.2020  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad-West,  whereby  appeal  filed  against  the  order  of 

learned  Trial  Court  was  partially  allowed  and  minor  was  held 

entitled  to  receive  maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.20,000/-  and  plaintiff  No.1  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  per 

month  and  the  amount  of  dower  decreed  by  the  learned  trial 

Court was set-aside.  

2. 

Petitioner in person while supporting the judgment and 

decree  passed  by  the  learned  trial  Court  submits  that  her 

husband  left  her  and  their  child  7  years  ago  and  thereafter 

never  came  back.  Petitioner  kept  on  fulfilling  her  obligations 

without  any  moral  or  financial  support  from  the  respondent, 

therefore,  the  learned  trial  Court  rightly  passed  the  judgment 

and  decree  for  recovery  of  dower  as  well  as  maintenance 

allowance, but the learned appellant Court without appreciating 

the  material  available  on  record,  passed  the 

impugned 

judgment and decree, which is not sustainable in the eye of law.  

3. 

Points  raised  needs  consideration.  Admit.  Notice  to 

respondent No.2 for 26-02-2021. 

4. 

To be heard alongwith W.P No.322/ 2021. 

C.M. No. 01/2021 

Exemption  sought  for  is allowed, subject  to  all  just  and  legal 

exceptions.
