VS 

Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad 
etc. 

Petitioner by: 

Mr. Jamshed Tariq & Mr. Raheel Aslam, 
Advocates. 

Respondent No.3 by: 

Mr. Majid Nadeem Bhatti, Advocate. 

Date  of Decision: 

06.03.2020. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI.  J:-  Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed  the  order  dated  06.04.2019,  passed  by  learned  Guardian  Judge 

(West) Islamabad  and judgment  dated 29.07.2019, passed by learned Additional District 

Judge Islamabad  (West), whereby his  application for rescheduling  of visitation  schedule 

settled vide order dated 02.04.2016 was dismissed concurrently. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner  is father of minors 

Alhan Ahmed  son,  date  of birth  29.10.2011  and Tohraan  Yasir  daughter,  dated of birth 

05.11.2006,  who  are  presently  in  custody  of  their  mother/respondent  No.3;  that  the 

petitioner  filed  guardian  petition  U/S  25  of the  Guardians  and  Wards  Act  1890, which 

was disposed of vide order dated 02.04.2016 after settlement of visitation  schedule; that 

due to changed circumstances, the petitioner filed an application seeking amendment and 

rectification  of the  visitation  schedule on the  grounds referred  in the  application,  which 

have not been considered by learned Guardian Judge as well as Appellate Court. 

3. 

Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.3 contends that visitation schedule 

was  settled  through  consent  of the  parties  and  any  rectification  should  be  made  with 

consent and in case of any difference, the matter should be decided by learned Guardian 

Judge while considering welfare of the minors, which requires proper adjudication. 

4. 

5. 

I have heard the arguments and perused the record. 

Perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner being father of two minors namely 

Alhan  Ahmed  born  on  29.10.2011 son  aged  about  9  years  and  Tohraan  Yasir  born  on 

05.11.2006 daughter aged about  14 years, who are in custody of mother/respondent No.3. 

Respondent  No.3  has  obtained  Khula  from  the  petitioner  through  the  Family  Court, 

W.P. No.3386/2019. 

2 

whereas  the  petitioner  filed  guardian petition  U/S  25  of the  Guardians  and  Wards  Act 

1890 for the custody of the minors, which was dismissed as withdrawn after settlement of 

the  visitation  schedule,  which  was  settled  with  consent  of  both  the  parties  vide  order 

dated 02.04.2016, which is reproduced as under:- 

"Today,  the  case  is fixed for  respondent  arguments  on  application 
filed u/s 12 of Guardian and  Wards Act  "GWA "for  interim custody of 
minor  namely  Tohran  (do.b.  05.11.2006)  and  Ilhan  Ahmed  (do.b. 
29.10.2011). 

2.  With the consent of both parties, following  visitation schedule  is 
fixed:- 

Petitioner I father  is entitled to meet with minors on first 

a. 
Saturday of every month from  10:00 am to 01:00 pm. 

b.  During  winter vacations, petitioner  I father  is entitled  to 
meet  with  minors for  one day from  10:00 am  to  01:00 pm  on 
first Saturday.  During summer vacations, petitioner  I father  is 
entitled  to  meet  with  minors for  two  days from  10:00  am  to 
01:00 pm  on.first and third Saturday of each month. 

On  birthday, petitioner  I father  is  entitled  to  meet  with 

c. 
minors from  04:00 to 06:00 pm. 

Petitioner  I father  is  entitled  to  meet  with  minors  on 
d. 
second  days  of Eid  ul Fitr and Eid  ul Azha from  10:00 am  to 
01:00 pm. 

All  visitations mentioned hereinabove shall be conducted outside court 
premises,  in presence  of bailiff  of this  court  against fee  of Rs.15001- 
payable  by petitioner  I father.  In  case  non-availability  of bailiff,  any 
representative,  appointed  by  court  will  supervise 
the  meeting. 
Petitioner  is also liable to pick and drop the minors from  residence of 
respondent  I  mother.  Petitioner  I father  is  liable  to  submit personal 
surety  bond to the tune of Rs.100, 0001- for  safe  custody and return  of 
minors,  he  is also  directed  not  to  remove  the  minors from  territorial 
limits of Islamabad  without first obtaining permission from  this court. 
Respondent  I mother  is also  directed to  intimate  this  court  regarding 
any  change  in her residential  address.  Both parties  are also  directed 
to  communicate  each  other  through  their  counsels  in  case  of  any 
change  in visitation  schedule,  due  to  emergent  reasons  only.  For  the 
said purpose,  cell  numbers  and  office  addresses  of both  the  learned 
counsels are as follows>

Humaira Masihuddin Advocate for respondent (0300-5508529) 
Office  Address:  Chamber  No.5,  Muslim  Block,  F-8  Markaz, 
Islamabad 

Jamshed  Tariq Advocate for petitioner  0300I0321-9431511 
suit  No.2,  Ground floor,  Fahad  Arcade,  13-Regal  street,  63-The 
Mall, Lahore. 

2. 
Both  the parties  are also  directed  to  comply  visitation  schedule 
fixed with their consent in its letter and spirit for welfare of the minors. 
In  case  of non  compliance,  both parties  are  at  liberty  to  avail  their 
legal remedies. 

In view of abovementioned visitation schedule, petitioner  intends 
3. 
to  withdraw  guardianship  petition,  however,  prayed  to  reserve  his 
right of custody as per  law. In view of statement  of petitioner  I father, 

W.P.  No.3386/2019. 

3 

instant guardianship  is dismissed as withdrawn, however, Petitioner is 
at  liberty  to  invoke jurisdiction  of  Court for  custody  of  minors,  in 
future,  as per  law, if so desired  File be consigned to the record room 
after its due completion. " 

6. 

The above referred visitation schedule was followed, however, the petitioner filed 

application  on  02.03.2017  with  the  prayer  that  visitation  order  should  be  rectified  and 

amended. Learned  Guardian  Judge as well as  learned Appellate  Court  after  considering 

prayer of the  petitioner  dismissed the  application on the  ground that  "no  cogent  reason 

has been provided bv the  detendantlapplicant  tor rescheduling  the  visitation schedule". 

I  have confronted learned counsel for the petitioner to justify  the reasons of rescheduling 

of  visitation  schedule  but  no  specific  reason  has  been  provided  rather  extension  of 

visitation is required by the petitioner/father for claiming overnight stay, half of summer 

and  winter  vacation  of  minors  and  50%  time  of gazette  holidays  and  he  is  entitled  in 

District  Multan  and  due  to  the  said  reason  he  is  entitled  for  enhancement  of  visitation 

schedule. 

7. 

While considering the above background, visitation order 02.04.2016 was passed 

by  learned  Guardian  Judge  with  consent  of  the  parties,  however,  at  present 

mother/respondent No.3  is not willing to  give her  consent for rescheduling  of visitation 

schedule  and  claims  that  question  of  enhancement  of  visitation  period  would  directly 

effect welfare  of the minors  and the  question requires adjudication  on merits  by way  of 

filing fresh custody petition U/S 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act  1890. 

8. 

There  is  no  denial  to  the  proposition  that  father  has  every  right  of  visitation, 

however, when  issue relates to the welfare of the minors, the  same requires adjudication 

by  the  competent  Court  of  law  as  in  previous  round  the  custody  petition  was  not 

adjudicated on merits  rather  the petitioner  withdrew his  custody petition  after achieving 

visitation 

right 

through  consent.  This  Court 

is  not 

in  position 

to  compel 

mother/respondent No.3  for rescheduling of visitation  schedule without determination of 

I  question of welfare of the  minors, which is reciprocally important and such exercise can 

I 
I 

only be done by Guardian Court. 

• 

19. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon 2018 SCMR 1991 (Mst.  Madiha 

Younas VS  Imran Ahmed),  whereby visitation  schedule has  been  finalized  and the  same 

can be used  in all  cases  but paragraph  3  of the  said judgment  clearly  spells out that the 

W.P.  No.3386/2019. 

4 

said  schedule  referred  by  Apex  Court  is  based  upon  reconciliation  between  the  parties 

with  consent  and  on  the  basis  of  compromise,  hence,  the  referred  judgment  is  not 

applicable in present case. 

10. 

In view  of above  discussion,  the  instant writ  petition  bears  no  merits,  therefore, 

the  same  is  dismissed.  The  petitioner  may  avail the  remedy  available  to  him  under the 

law to get redressed his grievance, if so, advised.
