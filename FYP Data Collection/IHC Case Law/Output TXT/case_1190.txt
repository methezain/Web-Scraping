Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Nemo. 

The case has been called out twice, once 

at  its  own  turn  and  second  time  after 

exhausting  the  cause  list.  There  is  nobody  in 

attendance  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner.  Name 

of  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

appears  in  the  cause  list.  It  seems  that  the 

petitioner  is  not  interested  in  pursuing  this 

petition anymore. 

2. 

In view of the above, the instant petition 

stands dismissed for non-prosecution.
