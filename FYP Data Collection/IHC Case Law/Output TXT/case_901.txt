Ms. Hadiya Aziz, Advocate (Amicus Curiae). 

  I  have  heard  the  learned  Amicus  Curiae 

(Ms.  Hadiya  Aziz,  Advocate).  This  Court  has 

asked  her  to  provide  further  assistance  in 

relation 

to 

the 

respective 

rights  and 

responsibilities  under  the  Muslim  Family  Laws 

Ordinance, 1961, for purposes of guardianship 

and 

the 

rights  and 

responsibilities 

for 

purposes  of  custody  and  to  identify  any 

overlap that might exist to see whether or not 

elaborate  visitation  plan  can  be  treated  as 

joint custody under the jurisprudence that has 

evolved in Pakistan in relation to guardianship 

and  custody  matters.  This  Court  has  further 

asked  her  to  assist  this  Court  as  to  whether 

the State is under an obligation to provide for 

the welfare of a minor child to the extent that 

no 

relatives  are  able 

to  provide  such 

assistance  and  otherwise  to  assist  this  Court 

on  the  responsibility  of  the  State  to  assume 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
responsibility  for  the  financial  needs  and 

welfare  of  a  minor.  And  further  whether  the 

State  can  be  obliged  to  ensure  that  expertise 

of 

psychologists 

and 

psychiatrists, 

to 

determine  the  welfare  of  children,  is  made 

available  to  the  Courts  that  are  deciding 

guardianship and custody matters. 

 2.    Let  notice  be 

issued  to 

the  Chief 

Commissioner,  ICT,  to  also  assist  this  Court 

on the last question as to whether it is for his 

office 

to  provide 

the 

requisite 

financial 

resources  and  make  arrangements  to  ensure 

that  professional  expertise  is  available  to 

Guardian Courts when they deem it necessary 

to  assist  them  in  making  custody  decisions  in 

relation to minors. 

 3.    The  office  is  directed  to  send  a  copy  of 

this  order  to  the  Chief  Commissioner,  ICT, 

who  will  ensure  that  a  report  is  presented 

before  this  Court  before  the  next  date  of 

hearing  and  his  office  is  represented  through 

counsel to assist this Court. 

 4.    Let  notice  also  be  issued  to  Advocate 

General Islamabad to assist with this question 

of law. 

 5.    Let the matter be fixed for 07.02.2022.
