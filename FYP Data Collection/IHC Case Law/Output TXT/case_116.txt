Nemo, for the Petitioner. 

1. 

2. 

None is in attendance on behalf of the Petitioner.  

It  is  noted  that  the  matter  is  pending  since  2021.  On 

23.05.2022 last and final opportunity was given to the Petitioner 

to  pursue  his  case  subject 

to  satisfying 

this  Court  that 

maintenance has been paid by him up to date and in case of non-

appearance the matter shall be dismissed for non-prosecution. On 

the next date i.e. 01.06.2022 the learned counsel for the Petitioner 

sought  withdrawal  of  his  Vakalatnama  which  was  allowed.  On 

01.02.2023  the  Petitionerâ€™s  sister  appeared  and  claimed  that  the 

Petitioner  is  hospitalized.  She  further  stated  that  the  Petitioner 

had  shifted  his  residence  and  she  undertook  to  provide  his  new 

address.  Since  none  is  in  attendance  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner 

today and till date this Court is not satisfied that the Order dated 

23.05.2022 has been complied with. 

3. 

In view of the above, the instant Writ Petition is dismissed 

for non-prosecution.
