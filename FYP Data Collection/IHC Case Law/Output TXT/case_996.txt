Writ Petition No. 4087/2021 

08. 

It is mentioned in Section 14(3) of the 

West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 

an interim order passed by a Family 

Court.” 

09. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 

President  All  Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020 SCMR 260), that: 

“It  is  settled  law  that  when  the 

Statute does not provide the right of 

appeal  against  certain  orders,  the 

same  cannot  be  challenged  by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High Court in order 

to gain a similar objective. Where a 

Statute  has  expressly  barred  a 

remedy which is not available to a 

party under the Statute, it cannot be 

sought  indirectly  by  resort  to  the 

constitutional jurisdiction of the High 

Court.  The  High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction  must  be 

fully cognizant and conscious of this 

Rule and strictly adhere to the same 

in the interest of advancing the policy 

of  law  and  delivering  expeditious 

justice in accordance with the law 

and the Constitution. Even otherwise, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 4087/2021 

constitutional jurisdiction is equitable 

and  discretionary  in  nature  and 

should not be exercised to defeat or 

bypass  the  purpose  of  a  validly 

enacted 

statutory 

provision.” 

(Emphasis supplied) 

10. 

In  another  case 

titled  as  Chief 

Executive  MEPCO  and  others  VS 

Muhammad  Fazil  and  others  (2019 

SCMR 919),   the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan has held that:  

“Where the Court or the Tribunal has 

jurisdiction and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of law, unless 

patent  legal  defect  or  material 

irregularity  is  pointed  out,  such 

determination  cannot  ordinarily  be 

interfered  with  by  the  High  Court 

while  exercising  jurisdiction  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution.” 

11. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  as 

Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad Usman 

and others (PLD 2018 SC 28), that: 

“The powers of judicial review vested 

in High Court under Article 199 of the 

Constitution  is  no  doubt  a  great 

weapon  in  the  Judge’s  hands 

however,  the  same  shall  not  be 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 4087/2021 

exercised in a case where discretion 

is  exercised  by  the  subordinate 

court/Tribunal  in  a  fair  and  just 

manner  without  violating  or 

disregarding  statutory  provision  of 

law, likely to occasion the failure of 

justice. Ordinarily such extraordinary 

jurisdiction shall not be exercised at 

random and in routine manner. The 

following case law is reproduced for 

the guidance of the learned Judges 

of the High Court for future course of 

action:   

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmed 

v.  Government  of  Pakistan, 

through  Secretary,  Interior 

Division,  Islamabad  (1994 

SCMR 2142). 

(ii) Shahnaz  Begum  v.  The 

Hon’ble  Judges  of  the  High 

Court of Sindh and Balochistan 

(PLD 1971 SC 677). 

(iii)  Malik  Shaukat  Ali 

Dogar v. Ghulam Qasim Khan 

Khakwani (PLD 1994 SC 281).  

12.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  also  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case 

titled  as  Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi 

VS Province of Sindh (1996 SCMR 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 4087/2021 

1165), that: 

“The statute excluding a right of appeal 

from  the  interim  order  cannot  be 

passed by bringing under attack such 

interim  orders  in  Constitutional 

jurisdiction. The party affected has to 

wait till it matures into a final order and 

then to attack it in the proper exclusive 

forum  created  for  the  purpose  of 

examining such orders.” 

(ii) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case 

titled as Mumtaz Hussain alias Butta 

VS Chief Administrator of Auqaf, 

Punjab (1976 SCMR 450), that: 

“As the said Ordinance has taken away 

the right of petitioner to interim relief, 

learned counsel submitted that this was 

a ground which entitled the petitioner 

to prosecute a writ petitioner despite 

the pendency of the proceedings on the 

District  Court.  The  argument  is 

misconceived  because  the  writ 

jurisdiction  of  the  superior  Courts 

cannot be invoked in aid of injustice 

and  in  order  to  defeat  the  express 

provisions of the statutory law.” 

13.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed to point out as to how the impugned / 

interim  order  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 4087/2021 

Family Court was the consequence of an error 

of  law  or  without  jurisdiction  or  in  excess  of 

jurisdiction.  

14. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
