where necessary. 

09.02.2022  Mr.  Hakim  Khan,  Advocate  for  the  petitioner. 

The  petitioner  prays  for  setting  aside  the  order  dated 

23.09.2021  passed  by  learned  Family  Court,  Islamabad  

West,  whereby 

the  earlier  order  dated  17 .07 .2021  for 

interim  maintenance  was  confirmed  on  refusal  of  the 

petitioner/defendant 

to  pay  the  interim  maintenance.  A 

decree  for maintenance  was  drawn  up  accordingly. 

2 

Learned 

counsel 

states 

that 

the 

decree 

of 

maintenance  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  was 

never  appealed  against  and  it  had  become  time  barred.  He 

now  prays  for  this  Court  in  its  Constitutional 

jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the  decree  of  the  learned  family  Court. 

This  cannot  be  done.  The  petitioner  cannot  jump 

the 

remedy  of appeal  and  come  straight  to  this  Court  in a writ 

petition  after  his  right  of appeal  has  become  time  barred. 

3 

This  petition  is  dismissed.
