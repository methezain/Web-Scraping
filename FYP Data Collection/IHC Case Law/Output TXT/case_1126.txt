where necessary. 

Date of order / 
Proceedings 
27.09.2021  Malik  Muhammad  Faisal  and  Malik  Atif  Raza 
Kalwar, Advocates for the petitioner. 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner, Faisal Shahzad, impugns the judgment 

and decree dated 17.12.2020 passed by the Court 

of 

the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  his  appeal  against  the  ex-

parte  judgment  and  decree  dated  20.02.2020 

passed  by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court, 

Islamabad, was dismissed. Vide the said ex-parte 

judgment  and  decree  dated  20.02.2020 

the 

learned 

Family  Court 

partially 

decreed 

respondent  No.1’s 

suit 

for 

recovery  of 

maintenance,  dower,  gold  ornaments  and  a  two-

room house.  

2. 

The  petitioner  and  respondent  No.1  got 

married  on  21.12.2015.  The  marriage 

is  still 

subsisting.  Respondent  No.1  was  earlier  married 

and  had  two  children  before  she  got  married  to 

the petitioner.  

3. 

In her suit, respondent No.1 alleged that the 

petitioner  was  a  drug  addict,  and  due  to  his 

abusive behavior  she  left her matrimonial  aboard 

five  to  six  months  after  marriage.  Respondent 

No.1  sought  the  recovery  of  her  dower 

in 

accordance  with  the  Nikkah  Nama  which  was 

produced in evidence as Ex.P/2.   

4. 

The  petitioner  was  proceeded  against  ex-

parte  but  subsequently  vide  order  dated 

28.09.2019  the  ex-parte  proceedings  was  set-

aside  subject  to  payment  of  cost  of  Rs.300/-.

W.P. No. 3413/2021 

Since  the  petitioner  did  not  pay  the  said  amount, 

the  said  order  dated  28.09.2019  was  recalled  on 

11.10.2019.  

5. 

The learned Trial Court decreed respondent 

No.1’s  suit 

to 

the  extent  of  dower 

i.e. 

Rs.1,000,000/-  and  ten  tolas  of  gold  ornaments 

along  with  a  house  measuring  three  marlas  with 

two  constructed  rooms.  It  was  clarified  in  the 

impugned judgment that a house measuring three 

marlas  along  with  two  constructed  rooms  within 

the territorial jurisdiction of the Family Court was 

to  be  given  to  respondent  No.1  failing  which  the 

market value of such house prevailing at the time 

of  execution  was  to  be  given.  Additionally,  the 

learned Trial Court  held respondent  No.1 entitled 

to  receive  maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.7,000/-  per  month  from  the  date  of  the 

institution  of  the  suit  (i.e.  April  2019)  with  a  10% 

annual 

increase.  The 

learned  Trial  Court 

disallowed 

respondent  No.1’s 

claim 

for 

maintenance  for  her  children  from  her  first 

marriage.  

6. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner could not 

controvert  the  fact  that  the  dower  mentioned  in 

the  Nikkah  Nama  is  inconformity  with  the  entries 

in the Nikkah Nama. It is not the petitioner’s case 

that  any  of 

the  dower  had  been  paid 

to 

respondent  No.1  at  any  stage.  Even  in  the  writ 

petition  it  has  not  been  pleaded  that  any  of  the 

dower has been paid to respondent No.1.  

7. 

The  petitioner  wants  to  absolve  from  his 

liability  to  pay  the  dower  in  accordance  to  the 

provisions  of  Nikkah  Nama  by  alleging  that 

respondent  No.1  had  become  a  Nasheeza.  The 

petitioner  has  also  alleged  that  he had  been  kept 

in  dark  about  the  fact  that  respondent  No.1  had 

been  married  twice  before  she  married  the 

petitioner.

W.P. No. 3413/2021 

8. 

The  grounds  agitated  by  the  petitioner  are 

not  sufficient  to  absolve  the  petitioner  from  his 

obligation  to  pay  dower  to  respondent  No.1  in 

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Nikkah 

Nama. Since the marriage between the petitioner 

and  respondent  No.1 

is  still  subsisting,  the 

petitioner  cannot  escape  from  his  obligation  to 

provide  maintenance  to  respondent  No.1.  The 

rate  at  which  the  maintenance  is  to  be  paid  to 

respondent  No.1  has  been 

fixed 

is  not 

unreasonable.  Since, 

I  do  not 

find  any 

jurisdictional 

infirmity 

in 

the 

concurrent 

judgments  passed  by  the  learned  courts  below, 

the instant petition is dismissed in limine.
