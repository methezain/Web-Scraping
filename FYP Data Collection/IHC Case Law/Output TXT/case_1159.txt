parties or counsel where necessary. 

                       27.08.2021.  Malik  Karim  Bakhsh,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner.  

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner,  Lehrasib,  assails 

the  order 

dated  28.07.2021  passed  by  the  Court  of 

the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  his  appeal  against  the 

judgment  dated  02.03.2020,  passed  by  the 

Court  of  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

was  dismissed  primarily  on  the  ground  of 

non-deposit  of  the  maintenance.  Vide  the 

said 

judgment  dated  02.03.2020, 

the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  partially 

decreed  respondents  No.1  and  2’s  suit  for 

recovery  of  maintenance  against 

the 

petitioner.  Each  of  the  said  respondents 

was held entitled for the maintenance at the 

rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  since 

December,  2018  till  their  legal  entitlement 

with 10% annual increase.  

2.  The 

record  shows 

that  marriage 

between  the  petitioner  and  respondent 

No.1 was solemnized on 06.06.2010. Out of 

the  said  wedlock,  the  couple  was  blessed 

with  a  son,  i.e.  respondent  No.2.  Due  to 

differences  between 

the  couple  on 

19.12.2018, 

respondents  No.1  and  2 

instituted 

a 

suit 

for 

recovery 

of 

maintenance  against  the  petitioner.  In  the 

said  suit,  the  petitioner  filed  contesting 

written  statement.  Out  of  the  divergent 

pleadings, the learned Family Court framed 

the following issues:-  

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lehrasib VS Irum Shahzadi and others  2 

W.P. No.3029/2021 

“(i)  Whether plaintiff No.1 is entitled to a 
decree for recovery of maintenance 
allowance? If so at what rate and for 
which period? OPP 

(ii)  Whether plaintiff No.2 is entitled to a 
decree for recovery of maintenance 
allowance? If so at what rate and for 
which period? OPP 
(iii)   What should the relief be?” 

3.  During  the  evidence,  respondent  No.1 

appeared  as  PW-1  while  the  petitioner 

recorded his statement as DW-1.  

4.  After  hearing  the  arguments  advanced 

at  the  bar,  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

partially decreed respondents No.1 and 2’s 

suit  vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

02.3.2020.  Feeling  aggrieved  of  the  said 

judgment  and  decree, 

the  petitioner 

preferred  an  appeal.  Learned  Appellate 

Court vide order dated 31.10.2020 admitted 

the  appeal  and  suspended  the  judgment 

and decree dated 02.03.2020 subject to the 

condition  that  the  petitioner  pays  current 

maintenance  allowance 

for  respondent 

No.2,  i.e.  the  minor  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

10,000/-  per  month  and  also  pays  the 

outstanding  maintenance  in  three  equal 

installments.  Afterwards  the  said  appeal 

was  fixed  on  fifteen  occasions  but  the 

petitioner  gave  no  regard  to  the  order 

passed by learned Appellate Court. He paid 

the  maintenance  for  the  minor  only  twice 

i.e.  on  07.11.2020  and  16.01.2020.  The 

case  was  adjourned  mostly  for  reasons 

attributable to the petitioner. Eventually, on 

06.07.2021,  the  learned  Appellate  Court 

recorded  warning 

and 

gave 

last 

opportunity  to  the  petitioner  to  deposit 

balance maintenance and to argue the case 

which  was 

fixed 

for  28.07.2021.  On 

28.07.2021,  again  the  petitioner  neither 

paid  the  maintenance  nor  addressed  the 

arguments  on  his  appeal,  resultantly,  the 

 
 
 
Lehrasib VS Irum Shahzadi and others  3 

W.P. No.3029/2021 

appeal  was  dismissed  for  non-deposit  of 

maintenance  vide  the 

impugned  order. 

Hence this petition.     

5.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

submitted  that  respondent  No.1  left  the 

matrimonial  abode  on  her  own  choice  and 

did  not  return  despite  all  his  efforts;  that 

during  the  evidence  before  the  learned 

Trial  Court,  respondent  No.1  remained 

unable  to  bring  evidence  to  prove  the 

petitioner’s  financial  capability  to  pay  the 

quantum  of  maintenance  sought  by  her; 

that 

the  petitioner  had  provided 

for 

separate  accommodation  to  respondent 

No.1  and    paid  her  maintenance  allowance 

at the rate of Rs.2500/- per month; that  the 

petitioner  applied  for  the  school  admission 

of  respondent  No.2  but  due  to  suspension 

of  educational  activities  in  the  wake  of 

pandemic he could not get respondent No.2 

admitted  in  the  school;  and  that  learned 

Trial Court as well as the learned Appellate 

Court  did  not  consider  the  financial  impact 

of  Covid-19  upon  the  petitioner’s  ability  to 

appear  before  the  Court  and  to  pay  the 

maintenance.    Learned  counsel  prayed  for 

the  petition  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the 

relief sought therein. 

6. 

I  have  heard  the  arguments  of  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and 

perused the record. 

7.  Despite 

having  been  given 

the 

opportunity,  the  learned  counsel  could  not 

establish from the record that the petitioner 

paid  maintenance 

for 

the  minor 

in 

accordance  with 

the 

order 

dated 

31.10.2020  passed  by 

the 

learned 

Appellate Court. The petitioner’s persistent 

default  was  despite  the  fact  that  maximum 

leniency  was  extended  by  the 

learned 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Lehrasib VS Irum Shahzadi and others  4 

W.P. No.3029/2021 

Appellate  Court 

in 

letting  him  pay 

maintenance  only 

for 

the  minor  and 

relieving him from payment of maintenance 

for respondent No.1. The learned Appellate 

Court  also  reduced  by  half  the  quantum  of 

installment  of 

the  minor’s  outstanding 

maintenance.  Now  a  Family  Court  under 

Section 17(A) of the Family Court Act, 1964, 

is  empowered 

to  decree  a  suit 

for 

maintenance where the person obligated to 

pay the same fails to do so. The said power 

can  also  be  exercised  by  the  Court  while 

hearing  an  appeal  against  the  judgment 

and  decree  passed  by  the  Family  Court. 

This is so because an appeal is considered 

continuation  of  suit.  The  impugned  order 

dated  28.07.2021  does  not  suffer  from  any 

jurisdictional  infirmity  so  as  to  warrant 

interference 

in 

the 

Constitutional 

jurisdiction of this Court.  

8.  A writ of certiorari is not a writ of right, 

but  one  of  discretion.  Its  object  is  to  curb 

excess  of  jurisdiction,  and  to  keep  inferior 

Courts within their bounds. The grounds on 

which  certiorari  may  be  invoked  is  where 

there  is  an  error  of  law  apparent  on  the 

face of record and not every error either of 

law  or  fact  which  can  be  corrected  by  the 

appellate authority. It lies where the inferior 

Court  has  exceeded  its  jurisdiction  or  has 

not  proceeded 

in  accordance  with  the 

essential  requirements  of  law  which  they 

were  meant  to  administer.  It  is  also  issued 

when  the  inferior  Court  acts  illegally  in 

exercise  of  its  jurisdiction.  For  instance, 

when 

it  decides  without  giving  any 

opportunity  to  the  parties  to  be  heard  or 

violates  the  principles  of  natural  justice. 

The  High  Court  while 

issuing  a  writ 

of certiorari   acts 

in  exercise  of  a 

 
 
Lehrasib VS Irum Shahzadi and others  5 

W.P. No.3029/2021 

supervisory  and  not  appellate  jurisdiction. 

Since  I  do  not  find  any  manifest  legal  or 

jurisdictional  error  in  the  impugned  order 

and  decree,  therefore,  the  essential  pre-

requisite 

for 

the 

issuance  of  writ  of 

certiorari are  not  satisfied  in  the  instant 

case. 

9.  For  the  above  reasons,  the  instant  writ 

petition is dismissed in limine.
