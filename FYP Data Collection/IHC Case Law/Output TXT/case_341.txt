Mr. Yasir Mehmood Advocate for applicant. 
Mr. Noman Ameen Farooqi and Muhammad 
Shakeel Mughal, Advocates for respondent No.2.  

        Through  the  instant  application,  applicant 

seeks  restoration  of  Writ  Petition  No.  1675  of 

2015,  dismissed  for  non-prosecution  vide  order 

dated 03.09.2020.   

2. 

 Learned  counsel  argues  that  he  has  not 

received any message about fixation of the matter 

during  holidays  and,  therefore,  could  not  appear 

on the date fixed. Further asserts that it is a well 

settled principle of law that the matter should be 

decided  on  merits  rather  on  technicalities  and 

that  the  matter  involves  valuable  rights  of  the 

applicant,  therefore,  he  may  be  afforded  to 

present his case.   

3. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.  2  submits  that  as  per  office 

report, learned counsel was duly informed about 

the  fixation  of  the  case  through  a  message  and 

that  the  matter  was  fixed  in  the  Regular  Cause 

List at Serial No. 2 in notice cases, therefore, the 

grounds being pressed to seek restoration are ill-

founded and application may be dismissed.

4. 

Heard. 

5. 

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  the  main 

petition  was  dismissed  for  non-prosecution  on 

03.09.2020  while 

the  application 

for 

its 

restoration was filed on 25.09.2020 i.e. within 30 

days. Though, learned counsel for the respondent 

has  vigorously  contested  the  application  yet  in 

order  to  decide  the  controversy  once  for  all,  it 

would  be  in  the  interest  of  justice  that  the 

applicant  should  be  afforded  an  opportunity  to 

present his case.  

6. 

At this juncture, it is necessary to mention 

that due to pendancy of the instant writ petition, 

the proceedings in a family suit filed way back in 

2011 are at-halt due to injunctive order.  

7. 

It  is  clarified  that  no  further  adjournment 

on  any  account  to  any  of  the  party  shall  be 

granted and in case the petitioner fails to ensure 

the  presence  of  his  representation  on  the  next 

date of hearing the matter shall finally be decided 

on the basis of material available on record.  

8. 

The  instant  application  is  allowed.  Order 

dated  30.09.2020  is  recalled  and  the  main 

petition  is  restored  to  its  original  number.  Let  it 

be fixed on 26.09.2022.
