Petitioner. 
for  Respondent 

Petitioners  have 

invoked 

the  Constitutional 

Jurisdiction  of this  Court by  way  of  filing  instant petition, 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution,  contending  therein 

that  Petitioners  have  to  proceed  for  Umrah  and  the 

Respondent  No.2  is  reluctant  to  issue  new  passport  to 

Petitioner No.1 and renew the passport of Petitioner No.2. 

2. 

Brief facts, as per  petition,  are that  Petitioner No. l 

is a household lady of 76 years of age and Petitioner No.2 

is  her  son.  Petitioner  No.2  is  a  laborer,  who  intend  to 

perform  Umrah  with  her  mother  and  for  that  purpose 

applied for a new passport for Petitioner No. l  and renewal 

of  his  own  passport  to  Respondent  No.2,  on  12.09.2018 

through  a  routine  procedure  whereby  they  were  issued 

token  slips  bearing  Nos.  10101844422  &  10101844412, 

respectively  wherein,  expected  date  of  delivery  of  the 

Passports  was  mentioned  as  25.09.2018.  However,  on  the 

date  of  delivery,  the  Petitioners  were  informed  that  their 

documents  have  been  forwarded  to  Islamabad  Police, 

Special Branch for verification of their status and after such 

Page 2 ofB 

W.P.No.  256/2020 

verification their passports will be issued, but after running 

from pillar to post and losing hope for issuance of Passports 

by  the  Respondents  in  time,  Petitioners  approached  this 

Court for redressal of their grievance. 

3. 

Learned  Counsel  for  the  Petitioners  submitted  that 

the  Petitioners  belong  to  the  poor  segment  of  the  society 

and intend to perform Umrah, being  a religious  obligation, 

applied  for  Passports.  Learned  Counsel  further  submitted 

that  Petitioner  No.2  born  on  12.12.1984  at  Mansehra, 

Pakistan  having  CNIC  No.  61101-9794474-7,and  was 

issued Passport bearing No.  A8719127, by the  Ministry of 

Interior  on  01.06.2009,  whereas,  his  elder  brother  namely 

Muhammad  Khan  born  on  17.07.1978  in  Karachi  having 

CNIC  No.  42501-1591334-7  and  his  younger  brother 

Bashir Khan born on  17.06.1990 in Karachi, having CNIC 

No.  13504-2338568-9  who  also  possess  Passport  No. 

C847319 

issued  on  02.07.2014.  Learned  Counsel 

contended that Petitioner No.2 is residing with his family in 

a  house  registered  in  his  name,  situated  at  Islamabad  for 

more  than  15  years,  therefore,  Respondent  No.2  has  no 

ground  to  hold  his  Passport  on  the  pretext  of  so-called 

verification  which  is  still  awaited  since,  September, 2018. 

Learned  Counsel  apprised  that  a  complaint  has  also  been 

filed  to  Prime  Minister's  Performance  Delivery  Unit 

(PMDU),  Pakistan  Citizen's  Portal  for  issuance  of  the 

Passports.  Learned  Counsel  asserted  that  the  impugned 

action of the  Respondent is not only against the provisions 

of Passport Act,  1974 but also violative of the fundamental 

rights  guaranteed  under  Articles  4,  9  &  15  of  the 

Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan,  1973.

4. 

Learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  No.3/NADRA 

submitted  that  no  objectionable  material  is  found  m 

Petitioners'  record,  therefore, 

they  issued  CNIC's 

to 

Petitioners'  family members. 

5. 

Learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  Nos.  1  &  2  filed 

parawise  comments  on  their  behalf,  whereby,  passport 

policy/passport and visa manual, 2006 along with copies of 

letters  sent  for  verification  of  Petitioners'  status  were 

attached  which  are  illegible.  Learned  Counsel  stated  that 

Petitioners'  Passports  have  been  withheld  for  verification 

of their national  status by the  Assistant  Director,  Regional 

Passport  Office,  Islamabad,  who 

issued 

letter  dated 

12.09.2018  to  Assistant  Inspector  General  of  Police, 

Special Branch, Islamabad,  for verification  of the  national 

status  of  both  the  Petitioners  and  in  reply  thereof,  vide 

letter dated 30.10.2018, it has been informed that a discreet 

inquiry  was  conducted  by  the  Special  Branch,  Islamabad, 

regarding  the  Petitioners  who  are  found  residing 

in 

Islamabad  for  last  18  years,  however,  he  suggested  that 

letter  be  also  sent  to  Petitioners'  permanent  residential 

district for determination of their national  status, therefore, 

Assistant  Director,  Regional  Passport  Office,  Islamabad, 

issued  separate  even  dated  letters  on  07.11.2018  in  this 

regard  and  thereafter,  reminders  dated  24.12.2019  to 

Additional  Inspector  General,  Special  Branch,  Peshawar 

and  Karachi,  however,  no  reply  has  so  far  been  received. 

Learned Counsel  submitted that  as  per  para  No.  23  of the 

Passport and Visa Manual, 2006 the officer is authorized to 

refer  any  doubtful  case  for  verification  to  the  relevant 

security agencies regarding  national  status of the  applicant 

Page4of8 

W.P.No. 256/2020 

and  submitted  that  the  verification  regarding  Petitioners' 

national status is under process. 

6. 

Learned Counsel for Petitioners has drawn attention 

of  this  Court  towards  sub  para  (ii)  of  para  No.  23  of  the 

Visa Policy, Passport and Visa Manual, 2006 filed with the 

comments  by  Respondents  wherein  it  has  been  mentioned 

that only in case of doubt about applicant's  national status, 

Passport  Office will  make  reference  to  the  Special Branch 

for verification, however, the  Passport  Office has  to justify 

in  writing  by  giving  reasons  in  this  regard  and  no  such 

reference should be made unnecessarily in routine. Learned 

Counsel  submitted  that  no  reason  whatsoever  has  been 

mentioned by Respondent No.2 while forwarding letters for 

verification  of  Petitioners'  nationality  to  the  Inspector 

General 

Police, 

Special 

Branch, 

Islamabad/Peshawar/Karachi.  Learned  Counsel  relied  on 

case

reported  as  "Naseem  Akhtar  Mehmood

7. 

Petitioners'  case  is  that  after  duly  processing  the 

applications  to  issue  new/renewed  Passports,  regional 

passport office, issued token  of delivery to  the  Petitioners, 

whereas, no objection whatsoever was communicated while 

submission  of  computerized  application,  however,  on  the 

date of delivery of the  said Passports,  it was informed that 

that  their  cases  have  been  sent  for  verification  of  their 

national  status.  It is  noted  that  process  of  verification  was 

initiated  on  12.09.2018  which  has  not  so  far  been 

completed.  I  have  gone  through  the  Passport  Policy  vide 

para  No.  23  sub-para  (i)  of the  Visa  Policy,  Passport  and 

Visa  Manual,  2006,  referred  by  counsel  for  Respondent 

No.2  and  the  representative  appearing  on  their  behalf, 

according  to  which  the  Passport  Officer,  while  accepting 

the  application  will  personally  satisfy  himself  about  the 

national  status/credibility of the  Applicant,  on which basis 

the  verification  of Petitioners'  national  status was  statedly 

initiated.  But,  above  referred  sub-para(i)  of  para  No.23  of 

the  policy  ibid  is  of  immense  importance  as  according to 

said  sub-para, the  Passport  Officers  are  not  authorized  to 

refer  cases for verification  as of routine  but  in case of any 

doubt about the national  status, the reference must  contain 

the reasons in writing in a register to be maintained for this 

purpose.  When  asked,  about  the  reason  for  referring  the 

Petitioners'  case  for  verification,  learned  Counsel  for  the 

Respondents  as well as representative  of Respondent No.2 

replied  that  the  Petitioners  were  not  able  to  speak  the 

Pashto language properly. 

This  Court  is  of  the  view  that  first  of  all  the 

reference of Petitioners'  case for verification  is against the 

Page  6of8 

W.P.No. 256/2020 

Passport  Policy  as  no  reason  whatsoever  was  recorded  in 

writing  regarding  alleged  creation  of  doubt  against  the 

Petitioners.  Secondly,  the  verbal  reason  of  not  speaking 

Pashto  language  properly  cannot  be  made  the  ground  to 

cast doubt on the national  status of the Petitioners when all 

their family members have been issued CNIC's  and two of 

them  have  also  been  issued  passports  considering  them  to 

be  the  Pakistani  nationals.  Petitioner  No.2  was  also  issued 

passport in 2009 on the basis  of CNIC duly issued to him, 

on  the  basis  of family  data  maintained  with  NADRA  and 

therefore, withholding of his passport at the time of renewal 

is  not  legally  justified.  Perusal  of  the  letters  issued  for 

verification  written  by  the  Assistant  Director,  Regional 

Passport  office,  Islamabad  dated  12.09.2018,  17.11.2018, 

&  24.12.2019  to  Additional  Inspector  General  Police, 

Islamabad/Peshawar/Karachi, 

respectively,  reveals 

that 

they  are  vague  as they  do  not  contain  any  specific reason 

regarding  creation  of doubt  concerning  national  status  of 

the  Petitioners.  It has  been  observed  that  the  Respondents 

have unnecessarily delayed the delivery of Passports to the 

Petitioners  on  the  pretext  of  ascertaining  their  national 

status  since,  September,  2018  without  any  lawful  reason 

and justifiable ground. 

8. 

In view of the above, it has been held that the action 

of the Respondent No.2  for not  delivering the  Passports to 

the Petitioners is illegal and in violation of Article 4 of the 

Constitution  of Islamic  Republic  of Pakistan,  1973  and  it 

has  now  been  well  settled  that  every  citizen  has  an 

inalienable  right  to  enjoy  the  protection  of law  and  to  be 

treated  in  accordance  with  law  particularly  no  action 

detrimental to the life, liberty,  body, reputation or property 

Page  7  of  8 

W.P.No. 256/2020 

of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law. 

Further, Article  14  of the Constitution states that dignity of 

man shall be  inviolable under Article 25 as all citizens are 

equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law. 

9. 

For  the  foregoing  reasons, 

instant  petition 

is 

allowed and the Respondent No.2  is directed to deliver the 

Passports  to  the  Petitioners  forthwith  so  that  they  may  be 

able to proceed for Umrah.
