necessa  . 
Mr.  Fahad  Ali, learned State Counsel. 
Mr.  Zaheer  Ullah Jan,  learned  counsel 
for  respondent No.2. 

The  petitioner, 

through 

the 

instant  writ  petition  under  Article  199 

of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic 

of  Pakistan, 1973, has  challenged order 

dated  11.04.2022,  passed  by  learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge-III 

/  Ex- 

officio 

Justice  of 

Peace, 

East- 

Islamabad,  whereby  petition  under 

Section 

22-A  Cr.P.C. 

filed 

by 

respondent  No.2  was  accepted  and 

S.H.O  concerned  was  directed 

to 

register 

F.I.R 

and 

proceed 

in 

accordance with  law. 

02.  Succinctly  stated 

facts  of 

the 

2 

Writ  Petition  No.1446 0(2022 

matter  are  that  the  petitioner  No.1  is 

serving  and 

the  petitioner  No.2 

is 

retired officer  of Islamabad Police;  they 

have  conducted  raid  and  arrested  son 

of  respondent No.2 in  a  narcotics case; 

respondent  No.2 

filed  an  application 

before  S.P  (complaint),  Islamabad  for 

registration  of 

case 

against 

the 

petitioners  and other  CTD  officials;  FIR 

was  not  registered;  respondent  No.2 

filed  an  application  u/s  22-A  Cr.P.C. 

before  the  learned Additional  Sessions 

Judge,  East-Islamabad  which  was 

allowed  vide  impugned  order  dated 

11.04.2022,  hence  the 

instant  writ 

petition. 

03. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

petitioners,  inter  alia,  contends  that 

allegations  in  the  FIR  are  false  and 

frivolous;  petitioners  are  law  abiding 

officers  of  Islamabad  Police;  they  have 

conducted raid after  getting  permission 

from  concerned the  Magistrate;  sons  of 

respondent 

No.2 

are 

hardened 

3 

Writ Petition No.1446 of2022 

criminals;  they  are  involved  in  many 

cases  registered against  them  u/s  9-C, 

CNSA,  1997;  they  are  behind  the  bars 

and just  as  a  counter-blast  in  order  to 

pressurize  the  petitioners,  respondent 

No.2  has 

filed 

the  petition 

for 

registration of  FIR. 

04.  Conversely,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.2  states  that  sufficient 

evidence 

is  available  against 

the 

petitioners;  proposed FIR  constitutes  a 

cognizable offence,  hence the  police is 

bound  to 

register 

the  case 

/  FIR 

against  the  petitioners  as  provided  in 

Section 154  Cr.P.C,  and  has  prayed for 

dismissal of  instant writ  petition. 

05.  Arguments  advanced  by  learned 

counsel for  the  petitioners  and  learned 

counsel  for  the  respondent  No.2  have 

been  heard  and  record  has  been 

perused with  their  able assistance. 

06.  Proposed  FIR 

/  complaint 

for 

registration  of 

case 

against 

the 

petitioners  has  been  addressed to  S.P 

4 

Writ Petition No.1446 of2022 

(complaint), 

Islamabad; 

respondent 

No.2  has  not addressed any application 

to 

the  S.H.O  of  concerned  police 

station  as 

it 

is  mandatory  under 

Section  154  Cr.P.C. 

that  matter 

regarding the commission of cognizable 

offence  must  be 

reported 

to 

the 

concerned S.H.O. 

07.  When 

confronted, 

learned 

counsel for  respondent No.2 has  stated 

that  an  application was filed  before the 

S.H.O  but  the  police refused to  receive 

the  same;  neither  copy  of  application 

submitted  to  the  S.H.O  for  registration 

of  case  was annexed with  the  petition, 

nor 

the  said 

important 

fact  was 

mentioned  in 

the  petition  u/s  22-A 

Cr.P.C. 

filed  by  respondent  No.2  for 

registration 

of 

FIR 

against 

the 

petitioners. 

08.  Another  important  factor  of  the 

case 

is 

that 

in 

the  proposed  FIR 

respondent  No.2  has  not  mentioned 

any date, time and place of occurrence. 

5 

Writ Petition No.1446of2022 

She  has  only  mentioned 

that 

the 

accused alongwith  police  party  forcibly 

entered  into  her house and stolen cash 

amount  and  one gold  ring  but  no  such 

details  regarding  date,  time  and  place 

of occurrence are mentioned. 

09. 

Learned trial  Court  while  passing 

the 

impugned  order  has  mentioned 

that  proposed  accused 

failed 

to 

produce 

search 

warrants 

for 

conducting  raid  upon  the  house  of 

respondent  No.2  before  the  Court  but 

the  petitioners  has  annexed  copy  of 

search  warrant 

issued  by 

learned 

Magistrate 

1st 

Class, 

Secretariat 

Division 

ICT, 

Islamabad,  whereby 

permission  to  enter 

in 

the  subject 

premises  was 

granted 

by 

the 

competent authority. 

10. 

It  is  also  admitted  that  sons  of 

respondent  No.2  are 

involved 

in 

number  of  criminal  cases 

registered 

under Section 9-C,  CNSA,  1997 as  well 

as  other  sections of  PPC;  both  of  them 

6 

Writ Petition  No.1446 0(2022 

are  behind  the  bars;  challan  has  also 

been  produced  in  some  cases  in  the 

learned trial  Courts. 

11.  Police  has  also  submitted  report 

in 

the  Court  of 

learned  Additional 

Session 

Judge, 

East-Islamabad, 

wherein  it  is  mentioned  that 

family 

members  of 

respondent  No.2  are 

habitual  drug  peddlers; 

no 

any 

application  for  registration  of  case  has 

been 

received  by  the  police  station 

Shara  Kahu,  even  no  application  has 

been 

received  in 

the  office  of  S.P 

(complaint);  application  for  registration 

of  case  addressed  to  S.P  (complaint) 

annexed with  the  petition  filed  u/s 22-A 

Cr.P.C.,  do  not  contain  any  date/diary 

number  etc.;  it  is  further  mentioned  in 

the  report  that  sons  of  respondent 

No.2 are  involved  in  07  criminal  cases 

registered under Section 9-C,  CNSA;  all 

proceedings 

of 

raid/arrest  were 

conducted  after 

obtaining 

search 

warrants  and  adopting  all 

legal  and 

7 

Writ Petition No.1446of2022 

codal formalities. 

12.  Learned  Additional 

Sessions 

Judge  /  Ex-Officio  Justice  of  Peace, 

East-Islamabad  while  passing 

the 

impugned order  has  not  mentioned any 

plausible reasons for  not  relying on the 

report,  submitted  by  S.H.O  Police 

Station  Bhara Kahu, rather  passed  the 

impugned  order 

in 

a  mechanical 

manner. 

13.  Learned  Ex-officio  Justice  of 

Peace  once called for  the  police report, 

cannot ordinarily  brush aside the same, 

in  case he  proposes to  give  his opinion 

contrary  to  the  police  report  he  was 

supposed  to  furnish  tangible  reasons 

for  not relying upon the  police report. 

14.  There  is  distinction  in  Sections 

22-A(6) 

and 

154 

Cr.P.C, 

for 

convenience  both 

the  sections  are 

reproduced here under: 

~  Section-22-Af6J: 

An  ex-officio  Justice  of 

the

complaint regarding: 

i) 

Non-registration  of 

criminal case; 

ii) 

Transfer 

of 

investigation 

from  one 

police officer to another; 

and 

iii)  Neglect,  failure  or 

excess committed  by  a 

police authority  in relation 

to 

its 

functions  and 

duties." 

~  Section 154 Cr.P.C Information

Every information  relating  to 

the commission of a cognizable 

offence if  given  orally  to  an 

officer 

incharge  of  a  police 

station,  shall  be  reduced into 

writing  by  him  or  under  his 

direction,  and  be read  over  to 

the  informant,  and  every such 

information,  whether  given  in 

writing  or reduced to  writing  as 

aforesaid shall be signed by the 

person  giving 

it,  and 

the 

substance  thereof  shall  be 

entered in a book to be kept by

Writ Petition No.1446 0(2022 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case 

titled 

as 

" Younas Abbass  and 

others  VS  Additional  Sessions 

Judge, Chakwal and others"  fPLD 

2016  SC 581 J,  has  held that: 

"Functions performed  by  Ex

S.22-A 

(6)  Cr.P.C.---Such 

functions  being  quasi-judicial 

in  nature  could  not  be termed 

as executive, administrative  or 

ministerial..  Said 

functions 

were complementary  to  those 

of  the police  and  thus  did  not 

amount  to  interference  in  the 

investigative  domain  of 

the 

police

Functions  performed  by  the 

~--  -.r.r:-:o Justice  of  Peace 

not

s  as  described 

in 

(i),  (ii)  and  (iii)  of 

22-A{6)  Cr.P.C, were

of  mind. Every /is  before  him 

demanded  discretion 

and 

judgment. 

Functions 

so 

performed  could not  be termed

16.  Proceedings  before  Justice  of 

Peace  are  quasi-judicial  and  are  not 

executive, 

administrative 

or 

ministerial  to  deal  with  the  matters 

mechanically 

rather 

the  same  are 

quasi-judicial 

powers,  every 

case 

before  him  demands  discretion  and 

judicial 

observations.  Reliance 

is 

placed 

on 

a 

case 

titled 

as

Ashar 

Halim 

Quraishi  VS Ex-officio  .Justice of 

Peace/Additional  Sessions .Judge,

alternative  statutory 

remedies  under
