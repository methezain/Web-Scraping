Junaid Umer Muhammad Zubari Alvi 

VS

Dr. Hafsa Muhammad Jamil Akhtar and others  

S. No. of order/ 
proceedings 

Date of  order/ 
proceedings 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary.  

               (1)                  20.01.2022.  Ms. Rabia Saghar, Advocate for the Petitioner. 

Through  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

assailed  Order  dated  06.12.2021  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court-West,  Islamabad, 

whereby, 

interim  maintenance  allowance  of 

Rs.15,000/- per month per child has been fixed for 

Respondents No.2 & 3 and Rs.12,000/- per month 

per child has been fixed for Respondent No. 4 & 5 

each.  

2. 

Facts, in brief, are that the Petitioner and the 

Respondent  No.1  were  married  on  04.05.2002, 

vide  Nikahnama  registered  on  11.06.2002.    The 

parties  were  blessed  with  four  children  i.e., 

Respondents No. 2, 3, 4 & 5. Respondents No.1 to 

5 filed suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis 

of khula and maintenance. On 06.12.2021, learned 

Judge,  Family  Court,  partially  decreed  the  suit  to 

the extent of Khula and dissolved the marriage.  

3. 

The  learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad,  vide  the  Impugned  Order  fixed  the 

interim monthly maintenance of Respondent No.2, 

3, 4 & 5 as aforesaid to be paid before 14th of each 

calendar  month.  The  Petitioner  has  assailed  the 

order through instant petition.

4. 

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted 

that the learned Trial Court has not considered and 

appreciated the financial status of the Petitioner. It 

has  been  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  cannot 

afford to pay the interim maintenance fixed by the 

Court  and  as  such  has  prayed  for  setting  aside  of 

the Impugned Order.  

5. 

The  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  in 

pursuance  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act, 1964, where under the Family 

Court has the jurisdiction to pass interim order for 

maintenance  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  in  a 

suit  for  maintenance.  The  purpose  behind  the 

provision of interim maintenance is to ensure that 

during  the  pendency  of  the  legal  proceedings,  the 

minors are not faced with financial challenges. 

6. 

Section 14  (3) of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

against an interim order passed by a Family Court 

with the obvious purpose to avoid delays.  

7. 

The 

Impugned  Order 

is  merely  an 

interlocutory order. The maintenance fixed through 

such  an  order  is  only  temporary.  The  quantum  of 

maintenance may be modified after appraising the 

evidence produced at trial. An aggrieved party will 

have  a  right  to  agitate  his  grievance  before  the 

appellate Court when the interim order merges into 

a  final order.  Even otherwise,  quantum  of  interim 

maintenance,  being  a  factual  dispute  cannot  be 

made  a  ground  for  invoking  the  Constitutional 

jurisdiction of this Court.

8. 

I am guided by the consistent view taken by 

different  Honorable  Benches  of  the  Islamabad 

High  Court, 

Islamabad 

in  various  matters 

including 

the  reported  cases  of  Dr.  Aqueel 

Waris VSIbrahim  Aqueel  Waris,  2020  CLC 

131;  [      ],  2018  CLC  506;  Mashkoor  Ahmed 

Khokhar VSThe  Family 

Judge 

(East), 

Islamabad,  2019  CLC  1635;  Muhammad 

Touseeq  Danial  Bhatti VSAyesha  Naeem, 

2021  MLD 

337; 

and  Aamir  Munir 

Puri VSMst.  Saima  Naeem,  2021  YLR  2166, 

wherein  it  has  been  held  that  interlocutory  orders 

by 

the  Family  Court  cannot  be  assailed  in 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  even  though  they  may 

be harsh in some instances. The instant petition is, 

therefore, not maintainable. 

9. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  said  discussion 

and  keeping  in  view  the  above  said  observations 

by  this  Court  in  the  aforementioned  cases  the 

Impugned  Order  dated  06.12.2021  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  West-Islamabad, 

does  not  call  for  interference  in  writ  jurisdiction.  

Consequently, 

this  Writ  Petition 

is  hereby 

dismissed in limine.
