(01) 

22.01.2019  Mr.  Shuja  Ullah  Gondal,  Advocate  for 

the 

petitioner. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR KAYANI  J.  Through  this  writ 

petition,  the  petitioner  has  assailed  the  order  dated 

23.11.2018,  passed  by  learned  Additional  District 

Judge  (East),  Islamabad,  whereby  the  order  dated 

19.09.2018,  passed 

by 

learned 

Judge  Family 

Court/ Guardian  Court  regarding  schedule  of visitation 

was  set-aside  and  matter  was  remanded  back  to  the 

learned  Trial Court. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter-alia 

contends  that  petitioner  being  father  of three  minors 

had  filed an  application  before learned  Trial Court  for 

visitation  of the  minors  namely  Haala  Bilal, Hawa Bibi 

and  Abdul Samad  Bilal, who were born  on  10.02.2012, 

04.07.2013 

and 

11.12.2014 

respectively.  The 

application  for  visitation  has  been  decided  by  the 

learned  Trial  Court  in  favour  of petitioner  vide order 

dated  19.09.2018,  which  was  assailed  by 

the 

respondents  before  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

(East),  Islamabad,  who  had  set-aside  the  order  of 

2 

W. P No. 229/2019 

visitation  and  remanded  back 

the  matter 

to  the 

learned  Trial  Court  with  the  direction  to  record  the 

evidence afresh  for adjudication  of the visitation  terms. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  been 

confronted  to justify  the  grounds  raised  in the  instant 

writ  petition  on  the  basis  of evidence recorded  by the 

learned  Guardian  Judge  in this  regard,  in  response  to 

said  query, learned  counsel  for the  petitioner  contends 

that  the  petitioner  has  filed  application  U / s  12  of 

Guardians 

and  Wards  Act,  1890,  which  was 

adjudicated  by  the  Judge  Family  Court/ Guardian 

Court  (East) while considering  the  pleadings  as  well as 

arguments  of  the  parties  only,  and  as  such  no 

evidence  was  recorded.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  further  contends  that  the  petitioner  has  not 

filed  any  application  for  permanent  custody  of  the 

minors  with reference to  Section 25  of the  Guardians 

and  Wards Act, 1890. 

4. 

Be  that  as  it  may,  the  record  reveals  that  the 

entire  controversy  was  initially  adjudicated  through 

the  order  dated  19.09.2018,  passed  by learned  Judge 

Family  Court  on  the  basis  of  mere  assertion  and 

pleadings  of the  parties  and  no  issues  were  framed, 

even  evidence  was  not  recorded  and 

the  learned 

Additional District Judge  (West), Islamabad  has  rightly 

set-aside  the  order  of  learned  Guardian  Judge  and 

remanded  back  the  matter  with  the  direction  to  the 

learned  Guardian  Court  to  record  evidence first  and 

then  to  decide  the  petition,  so  that  welfare  of  the 

minors  could be ensured.

W. P No. 229/2019 

5. 

The above referred view of the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge  (West), Islamabad  is  within  the  four 

corners  of law and  as  such  when  the  disputed  facts 

have  been  raised, 

the  best  course  to  decide  any 

controversy  is  to record  the  evidence of the  parties  for 

final  determination,  especially in  cases  of welfare of 

the  minors,  such  questions  could  not  be  adjudicated 

without  recording  of  pro  and  contra  evidence of  the 

parties. 

6. 

Keeping in  view the  above background,  learned 

counsel  for the  petitioner  has  failed to  point  out  any 

legal defects in the  impugned  order  dated  23.11.2018, 

passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West), 

Islamabad. 

7. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  instant 

writ  petition  stands  dismissed  in  limine.  However, 

learned  Guardian  Court  seized  with  the  matter 

is 

directed  to  decide  the  application  of  Section  12  of 

Guardians  and  Wards  Act,  1890  within  three  (03) 

months  from the  date  of receipt  of copy of this  order 

under  intimation  to this  Court.
