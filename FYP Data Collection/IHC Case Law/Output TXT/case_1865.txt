Through the instant writ petition,

the petitioner, Asim lrfan, impugns  the

judgment  dated 04.12.2018,  passed by

the Court of learned Additional District

Judge, lslamabad, whereby the

petitioner's appeal against the
judgment and  decreed  dated
17.07.2018,  passed by the learned

Judge Family  Court, lslamabad,  was

dismissed. Vide the said judgment  and

decree  dated  17.07.2018,  the learned

Family Court had decreed  respondents

No.1 and 2s' suit for recovery of past,

present and future maintenance,  etc.

The learned  Appellate Court has

dismissed the petitioner's  appeal on the

ground of !imitation.

The judgment and decree was

passed  by the learned Family Court on

17.07.2018.  The petitioner applied for

the  certified copies of  the  said

4\y

_t

g,

+

,

judgment and decree on 05.11.2018,

and on the very same d"y, they were

delivered  to the petitioner. The appeal

had been filed before the learned

Appellate  Court on 14.11.2018.  The

learned Appellate Court has correctly

observed that the petitioner had 30

days within which to file an appea!

against  the said judgment and decree

passed  by the learned  Family Court.

Being cognizant of the fact that

the  appeal was filed beyond  the

limitation  period provided  by law, the

petitioner had also filed an application

for condonation of delay alongwith his

appeal. In the said application,  the

petitioner had pleaded that the appea!

could not be filed within time due to the
serious i!!ness qf  the  petitioner's

mother. The documents on which the

petitioner placed reflance  upon show

that  the  petitioner's mother had

suffered from ailments, but they were

not such as would have rendered the

petitioner  unable to  file an appeal
against the judgment and decree

passed by the learned Appellate Court.

Since the petitioner's  appeal was time

3

barred by about two and half months;

and since the petitioner was unable  to

explain the delay of each day in filing

the appea!, I have been given no reason

to interfere with the Appellate judgment

dated 04.12.20118.  The  discretion

exercised by the learned  Appellate
Court in dismissing  the petitioner's

appeal on the ground of limitation does
not suffer from any jurisdictiona!
irregularity so  as  to  warrant
interference in  the  Constitutional

jurisdiction of this Court. Consequently,
the instant petition is dismissed  in

liminie
