WRIT  PETITION  N0.3950  OF  2019 

Rashid  Hussain 
VS 
Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  (East),  etc

Respondents  by 

Mr.  Sarfraz  Ahmad  Qureshi,  Advocate. 

Date of hearing

LUBNA SALEEM  PERVEZ,  J. 

Through 

instant  writ 

petition, 

petitioner has assailed judgment  dated  15.10.2019 whereby the appeal filed 

by  Respondent  No.  2  was  allowed  and  judgment  and  decree  dated 

03.09.2019, passed by the learned Guardian Judge to the extent of custody 

of  the  minors  was  set  aside,  whereas,  schedule  of  visitation  was 

maintained. 

2. 

The  brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the  petitioner  through  petition 

filed u/s 25  of the Guardians and Wards Act,  1890, (hereinafter referred to 

as the Act,  1890,) claimed custody of his minor children from the maternal 

grandfather  of  his  children.  Learned  Trial  Court  allowed  Petitioner's 

petition,  vide  judgment  dated  03.09.2019,  observing 

that  maternal 

grandfather  cannot  be  treated  in  comparison  with  the  petitioner  and  that 

under  section  19  of  the  Act, 1890,  no  one  else  except  father  (if  not 

disqualified) can be appointed as guardian of the minors till the minority is 

terminated.  The  petitioner  can  better  provide  livelihood  and  make  good 

future of the minors. However,  the minors were allowed meeting with their 

maternal  grandparents  by  devising  the  visitation  schedule.  Against 

judgment  dated  03.09.2019,  Respondent  No.  2  filed  appeal  u/s  47  of the 

Act,  1890, which was allowed, vide order dated  15.10.2019, and judgment 

dated 03.09.2019, was set aside and  keeping in view the welfare of minors 

the  custody  of  minors  was  handed  over  to  Respondent  No.  2.  The 

Petitioner/father  of the  minors  being  dissatisfied  with  the judgment  filed 

1-:V.P.No.  395012019 

present  petition  praying  for  setting  aside  the  impugned  judgment  dated 

30.09.2019 and handing over custody of the minor children to him. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for the  Petitioner  argued  that  father  is  the  natural 

guardian  and  unless  disqualified  has  a  right  to  have  the  custody  of  the 

children. Learned  counsel  submitted that petitioner  can better take  care  of 

the  welfare  and  wellbeing  of  his  minor  children  as  he  has  a  good job  in 

Saudi  Arabia  and  can  bear  the  expenses  of the  minor  children.  Learned 

counsel  in  support  of  his  contentions  relied  on  the  case  law  reported  as 

Surraya  Bibi  VS  Abdur  Rashid  (1980  CLC  785).  Mst.  Maryam  Mai  VS 

Judge Family  Court  (2004 SCMR  1382). Mst. Sardaran  VS  District Judge 

& others  (2016 AfLD 801) and Sitara Aslam  VS  Family Judge  and  others 

(2018 CLC 382). 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.  2  vehemently 

controverted the arguments of learned counsel for petitioner  and submitted 

that  the  deceased  Kosar  Naseem  was  murdered  by  the  family  of  the 

Petitioner/father  who  at  the  time  of  murder  was  in  Saudi  Arabia.  The 

learned counsel  referred the  evidence, statement and cross-examination  of 

the  Petitioner/father  during  trial  and  submitted  that  the  Respondent  No.2 

even during the  life time of deceased Kosar Naseem was bearing expenses 

of  the  minor  children.  Learned  counsel  pointed  out  the  admission  of 

petitioner  that  he  used  to  send  money  for  expenses  to  his  father  and  not 

directly to his wife. Learned counsel contended that family of the petitioner 

has  also  faced  charges  of  murder  of  Kosar Naseem  (deceased  wife)  vide 

FIR  No.  171/2017. Learned  counsel  further  contended  that  the  Petitioner 

has to return to Saudi Arabia on account of his job  and the minor children, 

if given custody, would be at the mercy of their paternal  grandparents  and 

family members  of the  Petitioner which were nominated  in the  murder  of 

mother  of the  minor  children.  Apart  from the  above,  learned  counsel  also 

submitted that the writ petition is not maintainable as the  facts ascertained 

during the trial as well as appellate stage cannot be reappraised by invoking 

the  Writ  Jurisdiction  and  urged that  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out 

any  legal  infirmity  in  the  impugned judgment  dated  03.09.2019.  Learned 

counsel relied  on judgments  re: Mst. Shahista Naz  VS  Muhammad Naeem 

Ahmed  (2004 SCMR  990). Mehmood Akhtar  VS  District  Judge.  Attack  & 

I  ~P.No.  395012019 

others  (2004  SCMR  1839).  Mst.  Rasheedan  Bibi  VS  Additional  District 

Judge & others  (2012 CLC 784) and Sohail  Yousa(&  others VS  Yasir Riaz 

& others (2019 YLR 1284). 

5. 

Arguments  for  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard 

and the documents placed on record have also been perused with their able 

assistance. 

6. 

In  the  present  case  the  petitioner  who  is  father  of minors  claims 

custody  of his  minor  children  being  natural  guardian  u/s  25  of the  Act, 

1890, by placing  reliance  on  certain  case  law  in this  regard.  There  is  no 

second  opinion  about  the  fact  and  law that  father  is  the  natural  guardian 

and  responsible  for  upbringing  of  the  children,  therefore,  he  has 

preferential  rights  over the  custody  of  the  minor  children.  Parameters  for 

the  purposes  of  deciding  the  appointment  of  guardian  are  provided  in 

Section  1 7  of the Act,  1890, according to which the prime importance  has 

to be given to the welfare of the minors. Therefore, the courts have always 

considered the welfare of the minors being the essential factor for awarding 

guardianship.  The  use  of the  word "welfare"  in  sub-section  (2)  of  section 

17  of the  Act,  1890, is  of great  significance as  it encompasses  all  aspects 

concerning  the  wellbeing  of  the  minor  i.e.  a  child's  health,  education, 

physical,  mental,  and  psychological  development.  Keeping 

these 

considerations  in mind,  record  and evidence  of the  trial  proceedings  have 

been  examined which reveals that  father of the minors I present  petitioner 

resides  and  works  in  Saudi  Arabia,  whereas,  mother  of the  children  has 

died of incident of burning allegedly by the parents and family members of 

the  petitioner.  Moreover,  the parents  of deceased  mother  were  financially 

supporting  her  and  minor  children  during  her  life  time  and  the  children 

were  emotionally  attached  to  their  maternal  grandparents.  The  record 

further reveals that nowhere in the entire evidence, paternal grandparents of 

the  minor  uttered  a  single  word  for  taking  responsibility  of  the  minor 

children. 

7. 

Hence,  after giving due consideration to the  facts and circumstances 

of the case as well as the law, I  am of the view that right of the father being 

natural  guardian  is not  the  sole  criteria for deciding the  matter  relating  to 

custody of the  minor rather the  sole criteria u/s  17  read with  section 25  of 

I  ~P.No.  395012019 

the Act,  1890, is the welfare of the minor. In this regard reliance  is placed 

on the judgment  of Hon'ble  Supreme Court titled as Mehmood Akhtar  vsss 

District Judge. Attack and 2 others (2004 SCMR 1839) .. 

8. 

In view  of the  above I  am of the considered view that  the petitioner 

has failed to point out any perversity or illegality in the impugned judgment 

dated  15.10.2019, which,  rather  is  well  reasoned  and  in  accordance  with 

the principles  laid down by the Apex Court thus calls  for no  interference. 

The  writ  petition 

is, 

therefore,  dismissed  accordingly  with 

listed 

application.
