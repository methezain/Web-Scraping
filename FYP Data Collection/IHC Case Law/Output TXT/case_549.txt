Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

                              29.03.2022.  M.  Qasim  Sarfraz,  Adovcate/proxy  counsel 

for Petitioner. 
Mr. M. Sadiq Khan, Advocate for Respondents.   

Learned  Proxy  counsel  submits  that 

learned  Principal  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  is 

busy  before  Honourable  Lahore  High  Court, 

Rawalpindi  Bench,  Rawalpindi, 

therefore, 

adjournment has been sought on his behalf.  

2. 

It  has  been  observed  that  Respondents 

No.  3  to  5  had  made  an  application  for  early 

fixation  which  was  allowed  and  matter  was 

directed to be relisted in the 1st week of March, 

2022 despite which matter is coming up in the 

last week of March, 2022.  

3. 

Be  that  as  it  may,  learned  counsel  for 

Respondents  has  highlighted  that  according  to 

the  impugned  judgment  maintenance  for  two 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
minor  children  was  fixed  as  Rs.  20,000/-  each 

whereas the operation of the said judgment was 

suspended vide order dated 10.12.2019 subject 

to  payment  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  to 

Respondent  No.  5  alone.  Since  then  the matter 

is  lingering  on.  Although  learned  Counsel  for 

Respondents  admits  that  payment  of  Rs. 

10,000/- 

is  being  made  regularly  by  the 

Petitioner  but  states  that  such  amount  is  too 

meager,  therefore,  he  has  objected  to  the 

adjournment sought by the Petitioner side.  

4. 

In  view  of  the  above  one  last  chance  is 

granted 

to 

the 

learned  Counsel 

for 

the 

Petitioner  to  argue  the  matter.  In  case  of  any 

further request for adjournment  is made,  order 

dated  10.12.2019  shall  be  modified  and  the 

instant  petition  will  only  be  heard  subject  to 

payment  of  maintenance  as  per  the  Impugned 

Order dated 07.11.2019.  

5. 

Relist on 13.04.2022.
