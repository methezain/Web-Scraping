Through 

instant 

petition, 

the 

petitioner Shahzad Liaqat has assailed  Ex-parte  judgment and decree dated 

26.10.2019,  passed  by  learned  Judge,  Family  Court-West,  Islamabad  in 

Family  Suit  No.  136/2016,  which  was  upheld  by  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge,  MCAC,  West-Islamabad,  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated 

07.11.2020, passed in Family Appeal No. 40/2020.  Hence, through present 

petition, the petitioner prayed for following relief:- 

“In  the  light  of  foregoing  legal  and  factual  positions,  it  is  most 
respectfully prayed that this Honourable Court may graciously be 
pleased to accept the instant writ petition, set-aside the impugned 
judgment  /  decree  dated  07.11.2020,  Ex-parte  judgment/decree 
dated  26.10.2019,  Ex-parte  order  dated  24.07.2019  and  order 
provision  of  one single  Opportunity of  hearing  on a fixed date to 
the petitioner for fair administration of law and justice.”.   

2. 

 Brief  facts  are  that  the  respondent  filed  a  suit  for  dissolution  of 

marriage on the basis of Khula, past maintenance w.e.f. July, 2015 till Iddat 

period  at  the  rate  of  100,000/-  per  month  and  recovery  of  dowry  articles 

according  to  list  or  Rs.  1,380,500/-  as  an  alternate.  The  suit  was  ex-parte 

decreed,  vide  judgment  dated  26.10.2019,  whereby  the  maintenance 

allowance at the rate of Rs. 25,000/- per month w.e.f. 20.07.2015, till expiry 

of Iddat period i.e. 28.12.2016 and the recovery of Rs. 367,500/- in lieu of 

remaining  dowry  articles  and  recovery  of  gold  ornaments  worth

W.P. No. 3936 of 2020 

Rs.261,000/-  or  its  value  as  an  alternate  was  ordered  to  be  paid  to 

Respondent No.1/Plaintiff. The judgment and decree dated 26.10.2019  was 

assailed  in  appeal  before  the  Additional  District  Judge,  MCAC,  West-

Islamabad, u/s 14 of the Family Courts, Act who, vide judgment and decree 

dated  07.11.2020,  passed  in  Family  Appeal  No.  40  of  2020,  dismissed  the 

appeal  filed  by  the  petitioner  on  the  ground  of  limitation  as  it  was  filed 

beyond the period of 30 days prescribed under the law. Hence, present Writ 

Petition  assailing  judgments  and  decree  dated  26.10.2019  &  07.11.2020, 

respectively. 

3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the delay on the part 

of petitioner in filing appeal was unintentional. He submitted that during the 

proceedings the case was transferred to another Judge and, therefore, before 

passing  any  adverse  order  against  the  petitioner,  the  learned  Judge  was 

required to issue notice to the petitioner, however, no such notice was issued 

before  commencing  the  trial  proceedings  by  the  learned  Judge,  who  has 

passed the impugned order; that it has been well settled that decision should 

be  based on  merits  and not on technicalities.  He  further  submitted  that the 

right  to  defend  the  case  has  been  seriously  prejudiced  before  the  learned 

Trial Court, therefore, he requested to grant a single opportunity to plead his 

case before the learned Trial Court.  

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.  1  strongly 

controverted  the  contentions  of  the  petitioner  and  submitted  that  appeal 

before  the  learned  Appellate  Court  was  filed  beyond  the  limitation  of  30 

days provided in the Family Court Act, 1964/Rules 1965. He submitted that 

Order  by  the  learned  Trial  Court  was  passed  on  26.10.2019,  whereas,  the 

appeal  before  the  learned  Appellate  Court  was  instituted  on  17.02.2020, 

therefore, the learned Appellate Court has rightly dismissed the appeal of the 

petitioner on the point of limitation as it is well settled that delay of each and 

 
Shahzad Liaqat v. Mst. Asfa Batool, etc  3 

W.P. No. 3936 of 2020 

every  day  is  to be  explained.  He,  therefore,  prayed  for  dismissal  of  instant 

petition. 

5. 

Arguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

relevant  record  including  the  impugned  judgments  and  decree  have  also 

been perused. 

6. 

Admittedly,  the  impugned  judgment  dated  26.10.2019,  has  been 

passed  against  the  petitioner  (defendant  in  the  suit)  ex-parte.  The  learned 

Trial Court, in para 5 of the impugned judgment has held that:- 

“5. 
The  defendant  Shahzad  Liaqat  submitted  his  duly  sworn  affidavit 
for  evidence,  but  thereafter  neither  he  reaffirmed  the  contents  of  his 
affidavit  nor  appeared  before  the  Court  for  cross-examination  rather 
disappeared from the proceedings,  hence he was proceeded ex-parte vide 
order dated 24.07.2019.”.   

7. 

Record shows that the order dated 24.07.2019 was not challenged by 

the petitioner and it is after a period of about three months from the date of 

passing of the said judgment by the learned Trial Court i.e. on 26.10.2019, 

that the petitioner filed appeal. It transpired from the stamp of the Copying 

Branch that the certified copy of the judgment dated 26.10.2019 was applied 

on 01.12.2019, whereas, the certified copies of the same was delivered to the 

petitioner on 03.12.2019, however, and the appeal against the said judgment 

of the learned Trial Court, was filed before the learned Appellate Court on 

17.02.2020.  When  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  petitioner  that  the 

petitioner had no knowledge of passing the ex-parte judgment is considered 

with  the  date  of  applying  and  obtaining  certified  copies  of  the  judgment,  I 

find  no  force  in  his  argument  as  first  of  all  the  order  dated  24.07.2019, 

whereby  he  was  proceeded  against  ex-parte  was  not  challenged,  secondly, 

the  final  judgment  was  passed  on  26.10.2019,  and  bears  the  attendance  of 

the learned counsel for the petitioner and thirdly, even if the time period is 

counted  after  obtaining  certified  copies  of  the  impugned  judgment  till  the 

filing  of  appeal  on  17.02.2020,  the  appeal  u/s  14  of  the  Family  Act, 

1964/Rules 1965, have been after about 75 days, whereas, in terms of Rule 

 
Shahzad Liaqat v. Mst. Asfa Batool, etc  4 

W.P. No. 3936 of 2020 

22  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Court  Rules,  1965,  the  prescribed  time 

period  for  filing  appeal  is  30  days  from  the  date  of  passing  the  decree  or 

decision excluding the time required for obtaining copies thereof. 

8. 

It has been noticed that the learned counsel along with instant petition 

has  also  filed  application  for  condonation  of  delay  for  filing  appeal  before 

the learned Appellate Court, bearing C.M. No. 02 of 2020. I am of the view 

that the application/petition for condonation of delay was to be filed before 

the learned Appellate Court as the delay has been occurred in filing appeal, 

whereas, the petitioner’s stance was that the appeal was in time. No purpose 

would be served by any application of condonation of delay filed before this 

Court as the competent court to decide the issue of limitation/condoning the 

delay has been vested with the learned Appellate Court before which forum 

the  delay  has  been  caused.  Thus,  C.M.  No.  02/2020,  is  held  to  be 

misconceived and is hereby dismissed.  

9. 

 In view of the above, after taking into consideration all the facts and 

circumstances and law on the subject, I am of the firm view that the appeal 

before  the  learned  Appellate  Court  was  hopelessly  time  barred  which  was 

rightly  dismissed  by  the  learned  Appellate  Court,  vide  its  judgment  and 

decree  dated  17.11.2020,  which  does  not  call  for  any  interference  by  this 

Court.  Thus,  the  present  Petition,  being  devoid  of  any  merit  is  hereby 

dismissed.
