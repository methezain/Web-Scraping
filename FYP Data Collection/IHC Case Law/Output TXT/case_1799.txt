30.09.2019 Ch. Sheraz Sohail, Advocate for the petitioner.

Order  with signature of Judge  and  that of parties or counsel
where necessary.

Through the instant writ petition, the
petitioner,  Javid lqbal Omer alias Omer Hayat,
impugns  the judgment  dated '17.O7.2O19,  passed
by the Court of the learned Additional District
Judge,  lslamabad, whereby  his appeal against the
order  dated  06.04.2019, passed by the learned
Family Gourt, was dismissed.  Vide the said order
dated 06.04.2019,  the learned Family Court had
closed the petitioner's right to file a written
statement to the amended  plaint.
2.  Learned counsel for  the  petitioner
submitted that the petitioner  had already  filed his
written  statement on 29.10.2018;  that earlier the
ex-parte proceedings  against the petitioner  were
set-aside,  vide order dated 17.'1O.2O18 subject to
the payment of costs; that on 06.04.2019, the
petitioner  had paid costs of Rs.5,000/-;  that after
the payment of costs, the learned  Trial Court
should not have struck  off the petitioner's right to
file a written statement to the amended plaint; and
that the learned  Appellate Court erred by holding
that the petitioner  had tried to prolong  the
litigation  and had abused the process of the
Court.  Learned counsel  for the petitioner prayed
for the writ petition to be allowed  and for the
concurrent orders/judgments  passed by the
learned Courts below to be set-aside.

3. 
I have heard  the contentions  of the learned
counse!  for the petitioner  and have perused the
record with his able assistance.
4.  The petitioner  has chosen not to file a copy
of the suit for recovery of maintenanee,  etc. filed
by respondents No.1 and 2 against the petitioner
before the learned Family Court. The documents
on the record show that vide order dated
26.06.2018,  the petitioner  was proceeded against
ex-parte  by the learned Family Court.  Vide order
dated 17.'1O.2018, the petitioner's  application  for
setting-aside the ex-parte proceedings  was
allowed subject to  the payment of  costs
amounting to Rs.3,000/-.  The petitioner was also
directed to file the amended written statement.
On 29.'10.2018, the petitioner filed the written
statement but did not pay the costs. The
petitioner was directed to pay the costs as well as
the outstanding maintenance  allowance for the
minor,  failing  which his defence was to be struck
off under Section 17-A of the West Pakistan
Family Courts Act,  1 964. On 19.11 .2018, the
petitioner sought an  adjournment for  an
opportunity to pay costs. On 27.1',.2018, the
petitioner was given a last and final opportunity to
pay the costs. Since  the petitioner  did not pay the
costs, the learned Family Court, vide order  dated
04.12.2018,  recalled its order dated  17.10.2018,
whereby  the ex-parte proceedings  had been set-
aside. The matter was adjourned  on 13.'12.20118
and 10.01.2019.  On the latter date, the matter was

adjourned  to 28.0 1 .2019.
5.  The petitioner  has chosen not to file copies
of the order dated 28.O1t.2019 and the subsequent
orders upto 21.03.2019.  Vide order dated
06.04.2019, the petitioner is said to have paid
costs amounting to Rs.5,000/-. However, the

3

W.P. No.327712019

learned Family Court struck off the petitioner's
right to file a written statement  to the amended
plaint. The said order dated 06.04.2019 was
assailed  by the petitioner  in an appea! before the
Court of the learned Additional District  Judge,
fslamabad.  Vide judgment dated 17.07.2019, the
said appeal  was dismissed.
6.  Perusal  of the judgment dated 17.07.2019,
passed  by the tearned  Appellate Court shows that
the petitioner  had not bothered to pay the interim
maintenance  for his minor son after filing the
appeat.  Several  opportunities had been  given by
the learned Appellate  Court to the petitioner's
counsel to argue the appeal, but to no avail.
Having gone through the appellate judgment
dated  17.07.2019,  I do not find any jurisdictional
infirmity in the same so as to warrant  interference
in the Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.
7.  Even otherwise, the petitioner's  appeal
against the order dated 06.04.2019 was not
maintainable.  The said order dated  06.04.2019
was an interim order.

Section 14 (3) of the West Pakistan Family
Courts Act, 1964 expressly  bars a right of appeal
or revision against an interim order passed  by a
Family Court. A party aggrieved by such an
interim order has to wait unti! a Family  Court
passes  a fina! order and then to challenge  it in an
appeal.  This is because  an interim  order merges
into the final verdict.  The purpose behind barring
an appeal  or a revision against  an interim  order of
the Family Court is to avoid delays in disposal  of
the cases by the Family Court. Since the suit
instituted by respondents No.1 and 2' is for
recovery of maintenance,  the fina! decree  that
may be passed by the learned Judge,  Family
Court would be appealable  under Section  14 of

4

W.P. No.327712019

the West Pakistan Family Court Act, 1964.
Reference  in this regard  may be made to the
following case law:
(i) 
ln the case of Syed Saghir Ahmad Nagvi  VS
Province  of Sindh (1996 SGMR 1165). it has been

held as follows:-

"The statute excluding  a right of appeal  from
the interim order cannot  be passed  by bringing
under attack such interim orders in
Constitutional  jurisdiction.  The party affected
has to wait till it matures into a frnal order and
then to attack it in the proper exclusive  forum
created for the purpose  of examining  such
orders."

(ii)  ln the case Mumtaz Hussain  a/ias Butta VS
Chief Administrator  of Auqaf. Punjab (1976 SCMR

450). it has been held as follows:-

'As the said Ordinance  has taken away the
right of petitioner to interim reliet learned
counsel submitted  that this was a ground  which
entitled the petitioner  to prosecute a  writ
petition despite the  pendency  of  the
proceedings  on  the District Court. The
argument is misconceived because  the writ
jurisdiction  of the superior Courts cannot be
invoked in aid of injustice and in order to defeat
the express provisions of the statutory law."

!n the case of Mst. Maham Shabbir VS
the Hon'ble

(.ii)
Salman Haider eou cLc 330)
lslamabad High Court held as follows:-

o9.  High Court in exercise  of its writ
jurisdiction is not sitting as a Court of appeal, or
court of revision. lts jurisdiction to interfere  on
the point of fact is limited. lntedocutory  order if
does not suffer  from any illegality,.,malafide  or is
not in excess of jurisdiction or lack of exercise
of jurisdiction  or not based on misreading,
misconstruing or discarding of the evidence
and material on record cannot be challenged  in
constitutional jurisdiction. Nevertheless,  the
facts of each case are to be considered
separately and no uniform principle can be
determined  for exerc is ing th e writ jurisdiction.  o
8. 
lt is my view that exceptional  circumstances
which could justify  invoking  the jurisdiction  of the
High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution
would be when the order or action assailed  was

5

W.P.  No.3277120'19

palpably  without jurisdiction, malafide, void or
coram  non judice. The order 06.04.2019  passed
by the learned  Family Court is interlocutory in
nature and does not dispose of the entire  case
before the Family Court. The said order as well as
the judgment dated '17.07.2019  passed by the
learned  Appellate Court impugned  in this petition
are neither without jurisdiction,  nor malafide, void
or coram non judice so as to warrant  interference
in the Constitutional jurisdiction of this Gourt
under Article 199 of the Constitution.
9.  Since I do not find the pre-requisites for
interference in the Constitutional  jurisdiction of
this Court  with the concurrent orders/judgments
passed by the learned Courts below to be
satisfied in the case at hand, the instant writ
petition is disFigsed. The petitioner wil! be at
liberty to  challenge the said order dated
06.04.2019  passed by the learned  Family  Court in
an appeal against  the final order passed by the
learned Family Gourt, if the occasion arises  for
doing so. There shall be no order as to costs.
