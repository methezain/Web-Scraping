18.12.2019  Mr.  Khurram  M.  Qureshi,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner 

C.M.No.5663/2019 (application  under  Section 

151  C.P.C.  for  appropriate  order)  is  fixed  for 

hearing  today.  However,  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  submitted  that  main  writ  petition  is  at 

motion  stage  as  such  same  may  be  taken-up  for 

hearing today. Allowed. 

MAIN CASE 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition 

the 

petitioner,  Muhammad  Shabir, 

impugns 

the 

judgment  dated  30.05.2019 passed by the  learned 

Additional  District 

Judge, 

lslamabad-(East), 

whereby  he  dismissed  the  petitioner's 

revision 

petition against the order  dated 11.03.2019, passed 

by the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad. Through the 

said  consolidated  order  dated  11.03.2019,  the 

learned  Civil  Court  over  ruled  the  petitioner's 

objections  against 

the 

report  of 

the 

local 

commission  and  also  dismissed  his  application 

under  Section  151  C.P.C. seeking  to  adjourn  the 

case sine  die. 

2. 

The  facts  essential  for  disposal  of  this 

petition  are  that  on  19.04.2013, the  respondents 

instituted 

a 

suit 

for  partition,  possession, 

declaration  and  permanent  injunction  against  the 

petitioner.  In the  said  suit,  it  was  averred  that  the 

respondents are  owners  of  a  land  measuring one 

kanal  six  mar/as 

in  khasra  No.1534  situated  in 

2 

W.P.No.4144/2019 

village  Phulgran,  Islamabad whereas  the  petitioner 

is owner only to the extent of five mar/as  but he is in 

occupation  of fifteen  mar/as  of land out of which  he 

built  a  house  on  five  mar/as.  The  petitioner 

contested the said suit  by filing  a  written  statement 

in  which  he  refuted  the  claim  of  the  respondents 

relying  on  sale  deed  executed  between  him  and 

Nazir Ahmed, a co-sharer of the respondents. 

3. 

Learned  Civil  Court  recorded  the  evidence 

produced  by the parties  and passed the preliminary 

decree  dated  30.06.2015, whereby  the  suit  of  the 

respondents  was  decreed  as  per  their  share.  It  is 

not  disputed  that  the  petitioner's  appeal  and  civil 

revision  against  the  said  preliminary  decree  dated 

30.06.2015  were  dismissed.  Through 

the  said 

preliminary  decree  dated  30.06.2015, the  learned 

Civil  Court  appointed  a 

local  commission 

to 

ascertain  as  to  whether  the  suit  land  can  be 

partitioned  and if so what should be the mode of its 

partition.  On  29.03.2017,  the  local  commission 

submitted 

its 

report.  The  petitioner 

raised 

objections  on  the  local  commission's  report  inter 

alia  on the  ground  that  it  did  not show  sketch  with 

measurement of  all  boundaries  of  khasra  No.1534; 

that  according  to the  report,  the  respondents were 

found in possession of 1 kanal and 13 mar/as,  i.e. 02 

mar/as  in excess of total  area of khasra  No.1534, as 

such the petitioner's  house is out of suit khasra,  and 

that  value of shares was not mentioned in the  local 

commission's  report.  The respondents  submitted  a 

reply  to  the  objections  wherein  they  supported  the 

report of the local commission. 

4. 

As mentioned above, the  learned  Civil Court 

and  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad 

spurned  the  objections  vide  concurrent  orders 

dated 11.03.2019 and 30.05.2019, respectively. 

3 

W .P .No.4144/2019 

5. 

Learned counsel for  the petitioner  submitted 

that the petitioner's  house does not fall within metes 

and  bounds  of  khasra  No.1534;  that  the  local 

commission's report  does not reflect  the procedure 

as 

to  how 

location  of  khasra  No.1534  was 

ascertained; 

that  method  of 

carrying  out 

measurements  with 

reference 

to 

the  revenue 

record  has  not  been  mentioned 

in  the 

local 

commission's  report;  that  the  impugned  report 

suffers  from  concealment;  that  through  a  family 

settlement between his predecessor-in-interest,  i.e. 

Nazir Ahmed and the respondents, fifteen  mar/as of 

land were  given to  the said  Nazir Ahmed in khasra 

No.1534; and that  learned Courts below passed the 

impugned  orders  arbitrarily  in  a  slipshod  manner 

without  the  application  of  judicial  mind.  Learned 

counsel  prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be  allowed 

and for the impugned orders to be set-aside and the 

revenue  officer  may  be  appointed  as  a 

local 

commission 

to 

submit 

report 

afresh  after 

demarcation of khasra  No.1534. 

6. 

I  have heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  have  perused  the 

record with his able assistance. The facts  leading to 

the filling of instant writ  petition have been set-out in 

sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  02 to  04 above and 

need not be recapitulated. 

7. 

The  main  thrust  to  the  petitioner's  case  is 

that  his  house constructed  on  5  mar/as  of  land  is 

situated outside the land under partition,  i.e. khasra 

No.1534. However, this contention  does not cohere 

with the petitioner's  pleadings and evidence. In the 

petitioner's  written  statement  as well  as evidence, 

his  stance  was  that  through  the  registered  sale 

deed  dated  24.06.2005  executed  between  the 

petitioner  and 

the  Nazir  Ahmed  (brother  of 

4 

W.P.No.4144/2019 

respondent  No.1 ),  the  former  purchased  a  house 

built  on  land  measuring  15  mar/as.  The  petitioner 

appeared  as DWÂ·1 and stated  on oath that  the said 

Nazir Ahmed originally  owned  05 mar/as  of  land  in 

khasra  No.  1534  but  as  a  result  of  a  family 

settlement,  he was  given  additional  10 mar/as  land 

in  khasra  No.  1534  in  exchange  of  the  Nazir 

Ahmed's  ownership 

in  khasra  No.1537.  The 

petitioner  could not prove the said family settlement 

and  issue  No.2 in this  regard  was  decided  against 

him  vide  preliminary  judgment  and  decree  dated 

30.06.2015 passed by learned  Civil  Court. The said 

judgment  and decree dated 30.06.2015 has attained 

finality.  It  was  also  admitted  by  the  petitioner  that 

through  the  registered  sale deed dated  24.06.2005, 

land measuring  5 mar/as  was  transferred  to  him in 

khasra  No.1534 and  the  remaining  10  mar/as  land 

was transferred  to  him in  khasra  No.1537. Now the 

field  map (shajra  kishtvar)produced  as Exh.P/3 and 

relied  on the  impugned judgment  dated  30.05.2019 

has  not  been  disputed  by  the  petitioner.  The  said 

field map (Exh.P/3) shows that  khasra  Nos.1534 and 

1537  are  not  adjacent  as  such  the  petitioner's 

contention  that his house is situated  outside  khasra 

No.1534 is not tenable. 

8. 

In  addition  to  above,  it  is  trite  law  that  the 

concurrent  findings  of the two  Courts  below cannot 

be  upset  by  the  High  Court  in  absence  of  any 

perversity,  illegality  or  material  irregularity.  In this 

regard  reliance  can  be  placed  upon  the  case  of 

"Syed  Hussain  Naqvi  and  others  v.  Mst.  Begum 

Zakara  Chatha  through  L.Rs."  (2015  SCMR 1081), 

wherein  it has been held that  High Court  cannot  go 

behind  the  concurrent  finding  of  the  Courts  below 

unless such finding  on the  face  of  it  is  against  the 

evidence  or  so  patently  improbable,  or  perverse 

5 

W.P.No.4144/2019 

that  to  accept  it  could  amount  to  perpetuating  a 

grave  miscarriage  of justice,  or  if  there  has  been 

any  misapplication  of  principle 

relating 

to 

appreciation  of  evidence  or  finally,  if  the  finding 

could be demonstrated to be physically impossible. 

9. 

In  view  of  above,  the  petitioner  has  been 

unable  to  point  out  any  illegality,  arbitrariness, 

infirmity  or  perversity  in the impugned orders  so as 

to warrant  interference  in Constitutional jurisdiction 

of this Court. Consequently, the instant writ  petition 

is dismissed in  limine  along with  C.M.No.5663/2019 

accompanied with this writ  petition.
