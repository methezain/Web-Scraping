TARIQ  MEHMOOD 

JAHANGIRI, 

J. 

Through  the  instant  Intra  Court  Appeal,  the 

appellant  has  assailed  Judgment  dated 

07.06.2021,  passed  in  Writ  Petition  No.  266 

of  2021,  whereby, the  learned  single Judge-

in-Chambers  has  dismissed  the  writ  petition 

filed by the appellant.  

02.  Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the 

appellant  had  challenged 

letters  dated 

24.09.2020  and  16.12.2020,  issued  by  the 

Ministry  of  Interior  whereby  her  request  for 

extension of visa was regretted.  

03.  The  appellant  is  a  national  of  People’s 

Republic  of  Bangladesh;  she  is  residing  in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

Pakistan  for  the  last  24  years;  she  came  to 

Pakistan  on  a  House  Maid  visa  in  the  year 

1996; in  April  1998  the  appellant  married  to 

Syed  Mazhar  Hussain  Zaidi,  a  Pakistani 

national  according  to  Muslim  rights  and 

ceremonies;  in  the  year  2011  the  appellant 

was  granted  one  year  multiple  entry  stay 

which  was  duly  renewed  till  the  year  2014; 

the appellant always applied for extension of 

her “Stay with Husband Visa” but in the year 

2014,  classification  of  her  visa  was  changed 

to  Visit  Visa  which  was 

regularly 

extended/granted till 12th May, 2020.  

04. 

In  September  2020,  the  appellant 

applied  for  one  year  extension  of  her  family 

visit  visa  but  respondent  No.  2  vide  letter 

dated  24.09.2020,  refused  to  issue  NOC 

regarding visa of the appellant.  

05.  Feeling 

aggrieved, 

the 

appellant 

through 

her 

husband 

filed 

an 

application/appeal  seeking  review  of  the 

decision  dated  24.09.2020,  but  again  vide 

impugned 

letter 

dated 

16.12.2020, 

 
 
 
3 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

respondent No. 2 regretted to issue NOC for 

visa  of  the  appellant.  Being  aggrieved  the 

appellant  filed  a  writ  petition  against  the 

impugned 

letters  but 

the 

same  was 

dismissed  by 

learned  Single 

Judge-in-

Chambers  vide  impugned  judgment  dated 

07.06.2021,  hence  the  instant  Intra  Court 

Appeal. 

06.  Learned  counsel 

for 

the  appellant 

states  that  Article  4  of  the  Constitution  of 

Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  deals  with  the 

rights  of  individuals  to  be  dealt  with  in 

accordance with law and the appellant has a 

right to be protected in accordance with law; 

the  appellant  and  her  husband  have  been 

condemned  unheard  and  without  any 

justifiable  reason;  that  contrary  to  clear 

provisions of Section 24-A of General Clauses 

Act, 1897; impugned letters are not speaking 

orders  and  the  respondents  have  failed  to 

justify the reasons for refusing application of 

the  appellant  as  mandated  by  law  and  the 

Constitution,  hence  both 

the 

impugned 

 
 
 
4 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

letters are liable to be set aside.    

07.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

08. 

It is an admitted fact that the appellant 

is  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh;  she  came  to 

Pakistan  in  the  year  1996  on  a  work  visa; 

subsequently  got  married  with  a  Pakistani 

national in the year 1998; thereafter, she has 

been  living  with  her  husband  being  legally 

wedded  wife  and  was  granted  visit  visa  till 

12.05.2020.  

09.  As  being  a  citizen  of  Bangladesh, 

married to a Pakistani national; the appellant 

can  apply  for  grant  of  citizenship  under 

Citizenship  Act,  1951.  When  confronted, 

learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  admitted 

that the appellant does not want to apply to 

get  the  citizenship  of  Pakistan  as  she  does 

not  intend  to  surrender  her  citizenship  of 

Bangladesh.  

10.  As  far  as  grant  of  family  visit  visa  is 

concerned,  it  is  not  a  vested  right  of  the 

appellant  that  she  should  be  granted  family 

visit  visa  for  an  indefinite  period  as  she  is 

 
 
 
5 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

already  residing  in  Pakistan  for  the  last  23 

years on visit visa.  

11. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  as 

“Owais Shams Durrani and others v. 

Vice Chancellor, Bacha Khan University, 

Charsadda and another”, (2020  SCMR 

1041) that:  

”It is trite that where a citizen seeks relief 

in constitutional jurisdiction he must point 

to a right statutory or constitutional which 

vests in him and has been denied in 

violation of the law.”  

12. 

It  has  also  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  as 

“N.W.F.P  Public  Service  Commission 

and  others  v.  Muhammad  Arif  and 

others”, (2011 SCMR 848) that:  

“The right which is the foundation of an 

application under Article 199 is a personal 

and individual right. The legal right may 

be a statutory right or a right recognized 

by the law. A person can be said to be 

aggrieved only when a person is denied a 

legal right by someone who has a legal 

duty  to  perform  relating  to  the  right. 

 
 
 
 
6 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

There must not only be a right but a 

justiciable  right  in  existence,  to  give 

jurisdiction  to  the  High  Court  in  the 

matter. Unless whatever right, personal or 

otherwise,  on  which  the  application  is 

based is established, no order can issue 

under Art. 199."  

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  cases  titled 

as  “Muntizma  Committee  v.  Director 

K.A.”,  (PLD  1992  Kar.  54), “Mahmoona v. 

Ilam Din”,  (PLD  1984  Lah.  223),  “A.F. 

Farms and Industries v. Development 

Commr”, 

(AIR 

1953 

Assam 

155), 

“Mahboob  Khan 

v.  Deputy 

Commissioner”,  (AIR  1953  Assam  145) 

and “Dineshcharan v. State of MB”, (AIR 

1953 Madh-B 165). 

13.  Hence,  the  discretion  exercised  by  the 

competent  authority  to  decline  the  request 

for extension of visit visa has not been found 

to be arbitrary or fanciful. 

14. 

Intra-Court  appeal  can  be  filed  when 

the impugned judgment of the Single Judge-

in-chambers is shown to have been delivered 

against the provisions of law and is the result 

 
 
 
 
 
7 

Intra Court Appeal No. 274  of 2021 

of  conclusions,  which  are  contrary  to  any 

specific  provision  of  law  or  is  the  result  of 

misreading, non-reading or same has caused 

miscarriage  of  justice,  or  mistakes  of  like 

nature; liable to be corrected by the Division 

Bench, otherwise, the judgment could not be 

upset in the Intra-Court appeal.     

15. 

In view of foregoing discussion, instant 

Intra Court Appeal is not maintainable, hence 

the  same  is  dismissed  in  limine  being 

merit less.
