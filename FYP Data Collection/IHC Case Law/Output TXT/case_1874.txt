Raja  Rizwan Abbasi & Mr. Sohail  Akhtar,  Advocates  for the
petitioner.
Mt. Zahtd Asif Chaudhry,  Advocate for respondent No.2.

Through instant  C.M U/S 426, CI.P.C,  the petitioner has

prayed for suspension  of the sentence  awarded to him by

Sessions Judge/Prevention  of Electronic  Crime  Court, Islamabad

in case FIR No.ll, dated  15.02.2016, U/S 36,37  Electronic

Transaction  Ordinance 2002, police station  Cyber  Crime Circle

FIA, Islamabad.  The petitioner  has been convicted  U/S 36 ETO

2002 and  sentenced  to undergo 03 years R.I and to pay fine of

Rs.2,00,000/-  and  in default whereof, he shall further undergo  06

months S.I. The petitioner  has also been convicted  U/S 37 ETO

2002 and  sentenced  to undergo 03 years  R.I and to pay fine of

Rs.2,00,000/-  and in default whereof, he shall further undergo  06

months  S.I.

2.  Brief facts leading  to the registration of the FIR are that

complainant/respondent  No.2 filed a complaint alleging  therein

that the petitioner hacked her facebook  account and further

created fake  facebook profile  account  i.e.

www.facebook.com/maham.nafees.  50 and started  blackmailing

2

C.M  No.01/2018  in Crl.  Appeal  No.13712018.

her with the intention  to satisff his lust upon which  she and her

family reacted, where-after  the petitioner  deactivated  her

facebook account  and created two other  fbke ID's in her name

and started  harassing  her by way of fabricating her pictures  in

loose  manner.  Complainant/respondent  No.2 further alleged  that

the petitioner  downloaded and displayed her personal

obscene/fabricated  pictures  and sent to her, her father, relatives

as well as friends'and  blackmailed  and  defamed  her in the eyes

of her family, relatives  and  friends.

3.  Learned  counsel for the petitioner  has contended that initial

burden ofproofhas  not been discharged  by the prosecution  and

both the offences  are not made  out from bare  reading  of the

impugned  judgment  and  learned Trial  Court  has not appreciated

the evidence  in its true perspective.  The forensic  report referred

in the case has not linked the petitioner  with the main uime and

he is entitled  for the benefit;  that punishment  awarded to the

appellant is short sentence  and the petitioner  has already  served

sentence  of 06 months,  therefore, sentence  of the petitioner  may

be suspended  as the appeal  could  not be decided  in near futue.

4.  Conversely,  learned counsel for respondent No.2  has

contended  that it is not mandatory in every  case to suspend  the

sentence,  even in cases where the sentence  is short; that the

petitioner  is charged  with the offence  of moral turpitude, who  has

ruined life of the complainant/respondent  No.2 by creating her

fake facebook  ID and  blackmailed  her by uploading  her obscene

pictures;  that the mobile phone and laptop  have  been recovered

from  the petitioner  and as such the duly established  technical

evidence  recorded  by FIA Forensic Experts has proved the case

against  the petitioner.

C.M  No.01/2018  in Crl.  Appeal No.1372018.

5.  I have  heard  the arguments and  gone  through  the record.

6.  There is no cavil to the proposition  that section 426 Cr.P.C

is meant  to deal with  suspension of the sentence, release  of the

appellant on bail pending the appeal, however,  the pre-requisite

to exercise  such  powers is that when  the delay is apparent in the

decision  of the appeal, although  there is no denial that the

punishment/sentence  awarded to the petitioner  is 03 years for

each offence U/S 36 & 37 WO 2002.  However, the delay in

deciding the appeal is paramount  consideration  for suspension  of

sentence, whereas  instant appeal has been filed on 12.09.2018

only a month  ago, therefore,  the exception  to exercise the

jurisdiction UIS 426, Cr.P.C provided in subsection  I-A is

$whose appeal  has not been  decided wilhin  period of 06 months

of conviction " whereas the petitioner  has claimed  suspension  of

the sentence prior to expiry of 06 months  after his conviction,

which seems  pre-mature  at this stage.

7.  Learned  counsel  for the petitioner  as well as learned

counsel  for respondent No.2  has relied upon 2@N1-L[652.

8.  While considering the above referred  authoritative

judgments of the superior  Courts,  following  principles  have  been

laid down for suspension  of the sentence:-

(a)  Where  sentence is short coupled with delay

in decision  of appeal.

(b)  There is likelihood  that the appeal  cannot  be

decided within near future.

(c)  The petitioner/appellant  has served the

major portion  of his sentence.

(d)  The sentence  shall not be suspended, where
role of the petitioner/appellant  cannot  be
extracted  without  deeper  appreciation of

evidence.

(e)  Powers  of the Appellate Court in granting
bail at post conviction  stage shall be guided

by the criteria/process  provided in section

497, Cr.P.C.

(/)  Sentence  should be  suspended  in
appropriate cases through  tentative

assessment of the evidence on record,  if case
of the convicted  persons is found fit fo,
grant  of bail.

(g)  Sentence  can be  suspended if  on
reconsideration  of evidence the Court of
the  view  that
appeal ls  of 
conviction/sentence is not liable to be
maintatned  by slightly touching merits of the

case  without  recording  conclusive  fi,ndings.

9.  Keeping in view above  referred principles, I  am  also

fortified with the limitation  described in subsection 1-A of

section  426, C:.P.C, which  is reproduced  for ready reference:-

(1-A) An Appellate  Court shall,  except  where  is of
opinion that the delay in the decision of
appeal has been occasioned by an act or
omission  of the appellant  or any other person

5

C.M  No.0U2018  in Crl. Appeal  No.13712018.

acting on this  behalf,  order  a convtcted  person
to be released  on bail who has been
sentenced.

(a) to imprisonment for a period not exceeding
three years  and whose appeal has not been
decided within  a period  of six months of his
conviction.

b)  to imprisonment  for a period exceeding  three
years  but not exceeding seven yeors  and
whose  appeal  has not been  decided within a
period of one year of his conviction;  or
(c) to imprisonment for life or imprisonment
exceeding  seven years and whose appeal has
not been decided  within a period of two  years
of his conviction.

Provided that the provisions  of the foregoing
paragraphs shall not apply to a previously
convicted offender for an offence punishable
with death or imprisonment for lfe or to a
Wrson who, in the opinion of the Appellate
Court,  is a hardened, desperate  or dangerous
criminal or is accused  of an act of terrorism
ptnishable  with death or imprisonment for life.

10. The above referred provisions indicate  that the legislature

has defined sentence into three grades and the above referred

categories have to be applied while  deciding  application U/S

426, Cr.P.C  in the light of principles  referred in paragraph  8 of

this judgment  while  maintaining those conditions referred  above.

I I .  In view of legal and  factual aspects of this case, I am of the

considered  view the petitioner  is prima  facie charged with

offences  U/S 36 & 37 ETO 2002 as he allegedly hacked

facebook  account  of complainant/respondent No.2 and created

two other fake IDs of the complainant/respondent  and started

harassing her by way of fabricating  her pictures in loose manner

and sent  the same to her, her father, relatives  and friends. Even

other-wise,  it requires appreciation  to segregate  the legal and

factual  aspect after appreciating the evidence during hearing of

main appeal  as to whether the prosecution has substantiated the

charges  against  the petitioner under the law or not?

6

C.M  No.01/2018  in Crl.  Appeal  No.13712018.

12. Besides the said consideration,  in this case only one month

has elapsed  after conviction  of the petitioner,  which does not

cross  the required  time frame  of 06 months  in cases where  03

years  sentence has been awarded.

13. For the foregoing  discussion, I am not inclined to accept

instant C.iWpetition U/S 426, Cr.P.C  for suspension of the

sentence, therefore,  the same is hereby dismissed.

Main  Case.

Office is directed  to fix the appeal on 30.10.2018

for arguments.
