2. 

Syed  Wamiq  Abid  Bukhari  (hereinafter  referred  to  as the 

"Petitioner")  has  challenged  order,  dated  20-07-2019,  passed  by 

the  learned  Additional  District  Judge-V  (East),  Islamabad 

in  W.P. 

No.3036/2019.

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

whereby  the  latter  in  order  to  ensure  execution  of  the  decree had 

ordered blocking of CNIC and his passport. 

3. 

The  facts,  in  brief,  are  that  the  Petitioner  had  entered 

into  a  marriage  contract  with  Ms  Faiza Wamiq Bukhari  daughter  of 

Akhtar  Hussain (hereinafter  referred  to as the  "Respondent"). The 

parties  were  blessed with  a  daughter  Syeda Hania Wamiq  Bukhari 

(hereinafter  referred  to as the  "Minor"). The Minor was born on 14- 

04-2010.  The  Petitioner  at  the  relevant  time  was  living  abroad  i.e. 

iif4  South  Africa.  The  Petitioner  filed  a  suit  on  09-02-2011  seeking 

restitution  of  conjugal 

rights.  However, 

the  suit  was 

later 

withdrawn.  Subsequently  he  filed  a  petition  on  09-02-2011  under 

sections 12 and  25  Guardian and Wards Act,  1890. A suit  was also 

filed  by  the  Petitioner  on  09-04-2011.  The  learned  Judge  Family 

Court  passed judgment  and  decree,  dated  31-10-2017.  Both  the 

parties  challenged  the 

judgments  and  decrees  by  preferring 

appeals. The appeal filed  by the  Petitioner was dismissed while that 

of  the  Respondent was  partially  allowed.  The  parties  had  assailed 

judgments  and  decrees  through  separate  constitutional  petitions 

before  this  Court.  The  constitutional  petitions  were  dismissed vide 

judgment,  dated 04-01-2019.  However, it was observed as follows.- 

During  the course of arguments  it  was pointed  out 

that  no decree was drawn  up regarding  enhancement of 

the  amount  of  maintenance.  This  matter  is  to  be 

considered  by  the  learned  Court  where  the  execution 

proceedings  are  pending.  Likewise 

the  question 

regarding  the  date from  which the judgment  and decree 

is executable is also be decided by the learned Executing 

Page  -  3 

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

Court  keeping  in  view  the 

decree  sought  to  be 

executed. Since this Court is satisfied that  the impugned 

findings  neither  suffer  from  any  legal  infirmity  nor  the 

discretion  has  been  exercised arbitrarily,  therefore,  no 

case  is  made  out  for  interference  while  exercising 

Constitutional jurisdiction. 

After  passing  of  the  above  judgment, 

the  decree  was 

drawn  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  on  18-02-2019  and  the 

same  is  as follows.- 

"Now vide judgment  dated 02.03.2018  of Learned 

Additional  District  Judge  East-Islamabad  the judgment 

and  decree  of  this  court  has  been  modified  and  it  is 

ordered  that  maintenance  allowance  of  the  plaintiff 

No.01  w.e.f.  23.09.2010  till  14.02.2011  @  Rs.15,000/  

per  month  is  modified  and  is  enhanced to  Rs.25,000/  

and  the  maintenance  allowance plaintiff  No. 02  is  also 

modified  and  enhanced to  Rs.30,000/-  per  month  from 

the  date  of  her  birth  till  marriage  with  10°/o annual 

increase  per  annum  which  increase  shall  be  effective 

from January of every year.  The plaintiff  is held entitled 

to the recovery of two lac rupees as dower, 23 to/as and 

7 mashas gold given to her by her parents" 

The judgment  and  decree  attained  finality  because  they 

were  not  challenged.  The  execution  proceedings  were  initiated.  The 

Petitioner  did  not  dispute  the  judgment  and  decree  except  the  date 

from  which  the  10°/o  increase  was  to  take  effect.  The  learned 

executing  court  vide  order,  dated  25-05-2019,  held  that  the 

increase  would  take  effect  from  the  date  of  the  judgment  and 

decree  of  the  learned  Family  Court  i.e.  31-10-2017.  The  order, 

Page  -  4 

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

dated 25-05-2017,  was challenged by the  Respondent by preferring 

an  appeal  which  was  allowed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge vide  order,  dated  20-07-2019.  On  the  basis of  the  operative 

part  of  the judgment  reproduced in the  impugned order,  dated  20- 

07-2019,  the  learned court  concluded that  the  increase per  annum 

was  to  take  effect  from  the  date  of  birth  of  the  Minor  till  her 

marriage. 

4. 

The  Petitioner  has challenged order,  dated  20-07-2019, 

and  the  learned  counsel  has  argued  that  the  appeal  was  not 

competent  under  section  14  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964 

(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  'Act  of  1964').  He  has  further 

argued  that  the  increase  would  take  effect  from  the  date  of  the 

judgment  and  decree.  However, there  is  no  dispute  regarding  the 

rest  of  the  decree.  The  learned  counsel  was  asked  whether  any 

undisputed  amount  was  deposited  or  paid  to  the  Minor.  He  has 

stated  that  the  calculations  made  by  the  learned  executing  court 

were  challenged and  appeal  is  pending  before  the  learned  District 

Judge.  He  has  further  stated  that  order,  dated  10-07-2021,  was 

suspended by  the  learned  appellate  court.  In  response to  a  query, 

the  learned  counsel for  the  Petitioner  has stated  that  according to 

the  calculations  of  the  Petitioner,  the  amount  that  is  liable  to  be 

paid  was  about  04  million.  Even  this  amount  admittedly  has  not 

been paid. The learned counsel has stated  that an amount  of  Rs.2.6 

million  has  been  deposited.  The  learned  counsel  has  also  argued 

that  the  learned  Family  Court  was  not  vested  with  jurisdiction  to 

block the CNIC nor the  passport of the  Petitioner.  He  has referred to 

Page  -  5 

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

section  13 of  the  Act  of  1964 in  support  of  his contention  that  the 

recovery  of  the  decreetal  amount  could  only  have  been  made  as 

arrears of land revenue. 

5. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondent on  the  other 

hand  has  contended  that  the  impugned  order,  dated  20-07-2019, 

does not  suffer  from  any  legal infirmity  and that  the  conduct of the 

Petitioner is contumacious.  He  has further  referred  to  the  operative 

part 

reproduced  by 

the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  in 

paragraph  4  of  the  impugned judgment.  The  learned  counsel  has 

further contended that the  appeal was maintainable because the Act 

of  1964 is  a  special statue  and the  learned executing court  also falls 

within  the  ambit  of the  expression as defined under section 2(1)(b). 

The  learned  counsel  has  referred  to  section  13  to  show  that  a 

special procedure for enforcement of decrees of the family  court  has 

also been provided in the said special statute. 

6. 

The learned counsel for the  parties have been heard and 

the record perused with  their able assistance. 

7. 

Admittedly,  the  dispute is only to  the  extent  of the  date 

on which the  increase of  10°10  would take  effect.  The judgment and 

decree have attained  finality.  The learned Additional  District  Judge- 

V  in  paragraph  4  of  the  impugned  order,  dated  20-07-2019,  has 

reproduced  the  relevant  portion  of  the  judgment  which  clearly 

shows that  the  maintenance  allowance  of  the  Minor  including  the 

/ 

10°10  increase shall  be effective  from  January of  each year  i.e.  from 

Page  -  6 

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

the date of birth  till  marriage. The expression 'from  the date of birth 

till  marriage of  the  Minor' is  crucial. The judgments  and decree~as 

already note~have not been challenged. 

8. 

The 

impugned  order,  dated  20-07-2019, 

is  well 

reasoned and, despite the able assistance of the  learned counsel for 

the  Petitioner,  no  legal  infirmity  could  be  pointed  out  requiring 

interference  by  the  Court.  There  is  also  no  force  in  the  argument 

that  the  appeal was  not  competent  under  section  14 of  the  Act  of 

1964. Section  14 provides for  a  right  of  appeal against  a  'decision' 

or a  'decree'  passed by a  Family Court. This distinction  is  crucial. It 

cannot  be  read  into  section  14  that  the  two  distinct  expressions 

should be read as 'judgment and decree' as has been suggested by 

the  learned  counsel.  'Decision'  is  defined  as  'a  conclusion  or 

resolution  reached  alter  consideration'.  It  refers  to  an  action  or 

process  of  deciding  something  or  resolving  a  question.  The 

legislature has used the  word 'or'  between the two  expressions and, 

therefore,  there  is  no  reason  why  they  should  not  be  treated 

disjunctively.  The  appeal  was  preferred  assailing order,  dated  25- 

05-2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court.  It  was  indeed  a 

'decision'  and,  therefore,  the  appeal  was  competent.  The  order 

impugned in the  appeal was not in  the  nature of an interim  order in 

the  context  of the  Act of  1964. The conduct of the  Petitioner raised 

questions  regarding  his  bonafides.  The  admitted  amount  has also 

not  been  paid  in  full  by  the  Petitioner.  He  has  been  delaying  the 

execution of the  decree by challenging various orders.  The order of 

the  Family Court  regarding  payment  of  the  decreetal  amount  was 

Page  -  7 

W.P.  No.3036/2019 

challenged,  but  the  amount  admitted  by the  Petitioner  himself  has 

not  been deposited  and  paid  in  full.  The  Minor is  his  daughter  but 

yet .on  one pretext  or  the  other  the  Petitioner has delayed payment 

of the admitted  amount  in  full. 

9. 

The  learned  Family Court  while  executing  a  decree and 

taking  into  consideration  the  conduct  of  the  Petitioner  was  not 

bereft of jurisdiction  to  pass appropriate orders including blocking of 

the  computerized  national  identity  card.  No  case  is  made  out  to 

initiate  criminal  proceedings. 

10. 

For the  above  reasons, the  petitions  are  meritless  and, 

therefore,  accordingly dismissed.
