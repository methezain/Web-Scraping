petitioner.  

Through  the  instant  petition  the 

petitioner  has  impugned  judgments 

and  decrees  dated  22.09.2021  and 

26.04.2021,  passed  by  the  learned 

Additional  District 

Judge 

(MCAC), 

West-Islamabad  and  Judge  Family 

Court 

/  Guardian 

Judge,  West-

Islamabad, 

respectively 

whereby 

defense of the petitioner was struck off 

under  Section  17-A  of  West  Pakistan 

Family  Court  Act,  1964  due  to  non-

compliance  of 

the  order  dated 

12.10.2020  regarding  the  payment  of 

outstanding interim maintenance. 

02.  Brief facts of the case are that the 

respondent  No.  1 

filed  suit 

for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

restitution  of  conjugal 

rights  and 

recovery  of  maintenance  with 

the 

following prayer; 

“In  the  light  of  above 

mentioned  circumstances,  it 

is,  therefore,  respectfully 

prayed  that  the  following 

decrees may kindly be passed 

in favour of the plaintiff and 

against  the  defendant  with 

cost: 

a.  A  decree 

for 

restitution  of  conjugal 

rights  and  defendant 

may  be  directed  to 

perform his marital and 

obligation. 

b.  A  decree 

for 

recovery  of  past  and 

future  maintenance  of 

plaintiff from November 

2018, at Rs. 50,000/- per 

month 

till 

her 

entitlement. 

  Any  other  relief  which  this 

Honourable Court may deem 

fit  and  proper may  also  be 

granted to plaintiff”. 

03.  Learned  Judge  Family  Court  has 

passed 

the 

impugned  order  dated 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

26.04.2021,  in  which  the  suit  of  the 

respondent  No.  1  was  decreed  to  the 

extent of maintenance allowance under 

Section 17-A of Family Court Act, 1964 

in  a  manner  that  the  petitioner  shall 

pay  an  amount  of  Rs.  20,000/-  per 

month 

as  maintenance 

to 

the 

respondent No. 1 since November 2018 

till  her  legal  entitlement  with  10% 

annual increase.  

04.  Being  aggrieved,  the  petitioner 

filed  an  appeal  against 

the  said 

judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

26.04.2021,  which  was  also  dismissed 

vide  impugned  judgment  and  decree 

dated 22.09.2021. 

05.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter  alia  contends 

that 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  of  the  lower 

Courts are against law and facts of the 

case;  learned  Courts  below  have  acted 

with  material  illegality  and  irregularity 

while passing the impugned judgments 

and  decrees;  the  appellate  Court  and 

learned 

trial  Court 

passed 

the 

 
4 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees 

without  considering  the  facts,  evidence 

and  record  present  on  file  and  thus 

reached  at  wrong  conclusions;  learned 

Courts  below  also  ignored  this  very 

important aspect of the matter that the 

petitioner 

is 

ready 

to  abad 

the 

respondent, as she is self deserted and 

is  residing  in  the  house  of  her  parents 

and  is  not  ready  to  abad  with  the 

petitioner  without  any 

reason  or 

justification; learned Courts below while 

passing  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  failed  to  apply  judicial  mind, 

hence both the judgments and decrees 

are liable to be set aside.  

06.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

07.  Respondent  No.  1  /  Madina  Khan 

filed  a  suit  for  restitution  of  conjugal 

rights  and  recovery  of  maintenance 

against  the  petitioner  on  18.02.2021, 

wherein  she  was  held  entitled  to  get 

interim  maintenance  allowance  @  Rs. 

20,000/- per month which was liable to 

be  paid  by  the  petitioner  on  or  before 

 
5 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

14th  of  each  month  vide  order  dated 

12.10.2020.  

08.  The  petitioner  did  not  make 

compliance 

of 

the 

order  dated 

12.10.2020,  passed  by  Learned  Judge 

Family  Court  rather  filed  a  review 

petition.  Thereafter,  vide  order  dated 

07.01.2021,  Learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  West-Islamabad  dismissed  the 

review  petition,  by  directing 

the 

petitioner 

to  pay 

the 

complete 

maintenance  allowance  on  the  next 

date of hearing failing which he will be 

proceeded  against  under  Section  17-A 

of Family Courts Act, 1964. It is further 

mentioned  in  the  said  order  that  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

informed  that  impugned  order  dated 

12.10.2020  has  already  been  assailed 

before  this  Court  in  writ  petition  No. 

2927/2020,  copy  of  the  petition  was 

produced  but  no  any  injunctive  order 

was  passed  by  this  Court,  hence  the 

review  petition  was  dismissed  and  the 

case  was  adjourned  for  11.02.2021  for 

 
6 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

complete  payment  of  maintenance 

allowance and for framing of issues. On 

11.02.2021,  lawyers  were  observing 

strike  and  the  case  was  adjourned  for 

17.03.2021; on 17.03.2021 the case file 

was transferred to other Court and the 

case was adjourned for 19.03.2021; on 

19.03.2021 the case was adjourned for 

12.04.2021;  on  12.04.2020,  learned 

counsel for the petitioner stated before 

the  Learned  Judge  Family  Court  that 

order  dated  07.01.2021,  whereby 

notice  under  Section  17-A  of  West 

Pakistan  Act  1964  was  given  to  the 

petitioner,  has  been  assailed  through 

writ petition No. 1364/2021 before this 

Court. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner  has  also  undertaken  before 

the  Court 

that 

if  order  dated 

07.01.2021  is  not  suspended  by  this 

Court, the petitioner will pay the whole 

outstanding interim maintenance by the 

next  date  of  hearing.  In  the  light  of 

undertaking  of  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner,  the  case  was  adjourned  for 

 
7 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

22.04.2021; 

on 

22.04.2021, 

the 

maintenance  allowance  was  not  paid 

rather  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

provided  opportunity  for  reconciliation 

between  the  parties,  the  matter  was 

adjourned  for  26.04.2021  for  payment 

of interim maintenance and completion 

of settlement; again on 26.04.2021, the 

petitioner  did  not  pay  the  interim 

maintenance  allowance  and  violated 

the  previous  order  passed  by  Judge 

Family Court, hence his right of defense 

was struck off and the suit was decreed 

to  the  extent  of  the  maintenance 

allowance  in  favour  of  respondent  No. 

1 and issues were framed upon rest of 

the claims to the extent of restitution of 

conjugal  rights  and  the  case  was 

adjourned for 27.05.2021, for evidence. 

09.  Order  dated  07.01.2021,  passed 

by Judge Family Court, West-Islamabad 

reflects  that  earlier  Writ Petition No. 

2927/2021  was  filed  in  this  Court, 

whereby  order  for  payment  of  interim 

 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

maintenance  passed  by  learned  trial 

Court was challenged.  

10.  Order  dated  12.04.2021,  passed 

by  Judge  Family  Court  /  Guardian 

Judge,  West-Islamabad  reflects  that 

another  Writ  Petition  bearing  No. 

1364/2021  was 

filed,  whereby  the 

order 

dated 

07.01.2021 

was 

challenged,  when  confronted  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  states  that 

both  the  writ  petitions  have  been 

dismissed but surprisingly filing of both 

the  writ  petitions  has  not  been 

mentioned  in  the  instant  writ  petition, 

even at foot of the writ petition no note 

regarding  filing  of  earlier  writ  petitions 

and  their  dismissal  from  this  Court  has 

been incorporated.  

11.  It is evident that the petitioner has 

not  complied  with  the  order  passed  by 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad.  There 

are 

concurrent 

findings  by  both  the  learned  Courts 

below,  the  petitioner  has  filed  the 

instant  writ 

petition 

by  mis-

 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

representation  and  concealment  of 

facts.  

12.  In this regard reliance is placed on 

the  cases  reported  as  2020 SCMR 

2155,  2020  SCMR  260,  2019 

SCMR 919, PLD 2018 SC 28, PLD 

2007 SC 45.  

13.  For  what  has  been  discussed 

above,  both  the  impugned  judgments 

and  decrees  dated  22.09.2021  and 

26.04.2021,  passed  by  the  learned 

Additional District Judge (MCAC), West-

Islamabad  and  Judge  Family  Court  / 

Guardian 

Judge,  West-Islamabad, 

respectively are in accordance with law 

and  facts  of  the  matter  which  do  not 

require  interference  by  this  Court,  as 

the petitioner has already filed two writ 

petitions  on  the  subject  matter  but 

deliberately  concealed  the  facts  in  the 

contents  of  instant  writ  petition,  no 

certificate  regarding 

the 

filing  and 

dismissal of said writ petitions has been 

incorporated.  

 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 4049/2021 

14. 

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ 

petition  is  dismissed  in  limine  being 

devoid  of  any  merits  with  cost  of        

Rs.  50,000/-  (Fifty  Thousand).  The
