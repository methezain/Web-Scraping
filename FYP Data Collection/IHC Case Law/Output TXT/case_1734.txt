09.01.2020.  Mr. Haroon ur Rashid, Advocate for the petitioner. 
Mr. Adil Aziz Qazi, Advocate for respondent No.2. 
Mr. Sadaqat Ali Jahangir, State Counsel. 
Tarah, S.I, P.S Abpara, Islamabad. 

Through instant petition,  the petitioner  has prayed  for post 

arrest  bail 

in  case  FIR  No.326,  dated  09.09.2018,  U/S 

324/452/337-F(d) PPC, P.S Aabpara, Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts as referred in the above mentioned FIR are that 

Faisal  Rafique/respondent  No.2  got 

lodged  the  complaint 

alleging  therein  that  on  08.09.2018,  at  about  7:55  p.m,  he  was 

present in house No.13,  street No.38,  sector G-6/1-3, Islamabad, 

Saeed  Mumtaz  Durani  ex-brother  in  law  (u.lj  rt  ,..Lil....)  entered 

into  his  house  and  fired  upon  his  son  Abdul  Ahad  Faisal,  who 

escaped  the  fire,  however,  Saeed  Mumtaz  Durani  fired  second 

shot with his pistol  upon Uzma  Faisal wife  of respondent No.I, 

where-after  the  accused  fled  away  from  the  scene  on  vehicle 

No.lDN-7329  Honda  Civic.  The  motive  for  causing  injury  to 

wife  of  respondent  No.2  is  dispute  of  sister  in  law  (~L..)of 

respondent  No.2  namely  Faiza, who  got  divorced  from  accused 

Saeed  Mumtaz  Durani  and  is  living  with  family  of  respondent 

No.2. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  the 

petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated in this case; 

2 

Crl. Misc. No.809-B/2019. 

that  this  is  second post  arrest  bail  application  on  the  ground of 

statutory  delay  as  trial  has  not  yet  been  concluded  despite  best 

efforts  of  the  petitioner  side  and  the  delay  is  attributed  to  the 

prosecution;  that  the  petitioner 

is  behind 

the  bars  since 

12.10.2018 and he  is  entitled  for  grant of post  arrest bail  in the 

judgments  reported  as 2016  P  Cr.  L  J 1206  (Muhammad  Riaz 

VS  State),  2015  P  Cr.  L  J 259  (lmran  Masood  VS  State)  and 

2018 P Cr.  L J 140 (Jalal Shah  VS  Niaz Akber). 

4.  Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2  and 

learned State Counsel contend that the petitioner  is hardened and 

desperate  criminal,  who  injured  wife  of  respondent  No.2  in 

desperate manner while entering into house by force; that charge 

has  been  framed  on  01.04.2019  and  statements  of  four 

prosecution  witnesses  have  been  recorded  and  only  four 

prosecution  witnesses  are  left  to  be  examined  and  it  would  be 

appropriate  to  direct  learned  Trial  Court to  conclude  the trial  at 

the  earliest;  that  only  evidence  of doctor  and  the  1.0 is  to  be 

adduced  because  the  doctor  was  not  available  due  to  which her 

statement could not be recorded. 

5. 

6. 

I have heard the arguments and gone through the record. 

Perusal  of  the  record  reveals 

that  the  petitioner 

is 

nominated  accused  in  case  FIR  No.326,  dated  09.09.2018,  U/S 

324/452/337-F(d)  PPC,  P.S  Aabpara,  Islamabad  with  specific 

role  of  causing 

firearm 

injury 

to  wife  of 

respondent 

No.2/complainant  Uzma Faisal on 08.09.2018 at about 7:55 p.m 

in presence of the witnesses. 

7. 

This is second post arrest bail petition, which has been filed 

on the ground of statutory delay, whereas  earlier post arrest bail 

petition  of the petitioner was dismissed  by this  Court on merits, 

3 

Crl. Misc. No.809-8/2019. 

therefore, this Court confines itself only to the extent of statutory 

delay. 

8. 

Perusal of record further reveals that charge was framed on 

01.04.2019 and out of eight witnesses, evidence of four P.Ws has 

been  recorded  and  only  material  witnesses  i.e.  Dr.  Durdana 

Kazmi,  MLO,  Poly  Clinic  Hospital, 

Islamabad  and 

the 

Investigation  Officer,  Tasadaq  Hussain,  S.I,  P.S  Aabpara, 

Islamabad  are  left to  be  examined, therefore,  there  is  likelihood 

that the trial will be concluded in short time. 

9. 

Besides the above referred position, learned Sessions Judge 

has passed direction vide order dated 22.11.2019 to conclude the 

trial  "preferably  within  period  of two months".  In this  situation 

question  of  delay  has  to  be  seen  in  the  light  of  record,  which 

reflects that the prosecution has produced witnesses after framing 

of the charge on  18.05.2019 and 01.06.2019 and four prosecution 

witnesses  have  recorded  their  statements  and  all  the  remaining 

witnesses  have been  called by  learned Trial Court, which shows 

that  statements of  private  witnesses  have  already  been  recorded 

and  there  is  no  intentional  delay  on  part  of  the  prosecution. 

Therefore, ground raised by the petitioner regarding delay in trial 

is  not  attributed  to  the  prosecution,  which  is  key  factor  to  be 

considered  for  release  on  bail  in  terms  of  section  497,  Cr.P.C. 

This  Court  is  guided  by  the  pronouncement  of the  Apex  Court 

reported  as  2016  SCMR  2094  (Muhammad  Aslam  vs  State), 

2015  MLD  181  (Muhammad  Umar  VS  State),  2017  MLD  464 

(Nasir  alias  Imran  Nasir  VS  State),  2016  MLD  1742 

(Muhammad  Iqbal VS  State), 2017 P Cr.  L J 21 (Ameer Hamza 

VS  State)  and 2016 P Cr. L  J Note  105  (Abdul  Havee  Rind  VS 

State),  whereby  post  arrest  bails  on  statutory  ground  were 

refused  while  considering  the  reasonable  grounds  as  well  as 

4 

Crl. Misc.  No.809-8/2019. 

desperate  character  of  the  accused  including  other  reasons  of 

delay, which were attributed to the accused. However, this Court 

is bound by the dictum laid down in 2011SCMR1332  (Rehmat 

Ullah VS  The State and another),  wherein it has been held that:- 

"The  courts  should  not  grant  or  cancel  bail 
when  the  trial  is  in  progress  and  proper 
course for the courts in such a situation would 
trial  Court  to 
the  learned 
be  to  direct 
conclude  the  trial  of  the  case  within  a 
specified period". 

10. 

In  view  of  above  discussion,  the  instant  petition  is 

dismissed. However, learned Trial Court seized with the matter is 

directed  to  summon  Dr.  Durdana  Kazmi,  MLO,  Poly  Clinic 

Hospital,  Islamabad  and  the  Investigation  Officer,  Tasadaq 

Hussain, S.I, P.S Aabpara, Islamabad on the next date of hearing 

for recording their testimonies  and to conclude the trial within a 

period of 04 months from the date of receipt of copy of this order 

under intimation to this Court.
