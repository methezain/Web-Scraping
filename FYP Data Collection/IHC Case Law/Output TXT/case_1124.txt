Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary. 

Waqas Ali, Advocates for the petitioners. 

Through  the 

instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioners,  who  are 

former  employees  of 

Pakistan 

International  Airlines  Corporation 

(“P.I.A.C.”) impugn various terms and conditions 

of  the  Voluntary  Separation  Scheme  dated 

07.12.2020  (“V.S.S.-2020”).  All  the  petitioners 

retired  from  service as  a result of  opting  for  the 

V.S.S.-2020.  

2.  The  petitioners  also  seek  a  direction  to 

P.I.A.C.  to  issue  fresh  terms  and  conditions  for 

the V.S.S.-2020 which are not less favorable than 

the  Voluntary  Golden  Handshake  Scheme 

offered  by  P.I.A.C. 

to 

their  employees  on 

02.12.1997.  

3.  Learned counsel for the petitioners drew the 

attention of the Court to the terms and conditions 

of  the  V.S.S.-2020  and  submitted  that  all  the 

petitioners  retired  from  service  after  opting  for 

and  receiving  all  the  benefits  under  the  said 

scheme.  Their  grievance  is  that  the  benefits 

under the V.S.S.-2020 are less attractive than the 

benefits  which  were  given  to  the  employees  of 

P.I.A.C.  who  had  opted  for  retirement  on  the 

Voluntary  Golden  Handshake  Scheme  dated 

02.12.1997.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners 

also  referred  to  section  3(6)(iii)  and  (iv)  of  the 

Pakistan 

International  Airlines  Corporation 

(Conversion)  Act,  2016  (“the  2016  Act”)  and

W.P. No.3437/2021 

submitted 

that 

the  service  and  retirement  

benefits  of  the  petitioners  could  not  have  been 

changed  to  their  disadvantage;  and  that  the 

petitioners were arm-twisted and coerced by the 

management  of  P.I.A.C.  to  opt  the  V.S.S.-2020 

failing  which 

they  were 

threatened 

to  be 

mandatorily  retired  from  service  under  the 

Mandatory 

Separation 

Scheme 

dated 

29.12.2020.  The  petitioners  seek  issuance  of  a 

writ  to  the  P.I.A.C.  to  amend  the  V.S.S.-2020  so 

as  to  give  to  the  petitioners  the  benefits  which 

had  been  given 

to 

the  employees  of 

the 

Voluntary  Golden  Handshake  Scheme  dated 

02.12.1997.  

4. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioners  and  perused  the 

record with their able assistance.  

5.  Perusal  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the 

V.S.S.-2020  shows 

that 

the 

last  date 

for 

submission  of  application  for  opting  for  the  said 

scheme  was  22.12.2020. 

It 

is  an  admitted 

position 

that  all 

the  petitioners  opted 

for 

retirement  under  V.S.S.-2020  and  have  already 

obtained  all  the  benefits  thereunder.  More  than 

eight months after opting for the V.S.S.-2020 the 

petitioners  have  filed  the  instant  writ  petition 

with  the  purpose  of  seeking  more  benefits  than 

those  to  which  they  were  entitled  under  the 

V.S.S.-2020. 

6.  Before delving into the merits of the case, it 

first  needs  to  be  determined  whether  this  Court 

can  issue  a  writ  of  mandamus  to  the  P.I.A.C.  at 

the 

instance  of 

the  petitioners  who  have 

admittedly  opted  for  and  obtained  all  benefits 

under V.S.S.-2020.  

7.  The petitioners had not retired from service 

in  the  ordinary  course  or  under  any  statutory 

 
3 

W.P. No.3437/2021 

rules  of  P.I.A.C.,  if  any,  but  as  a  result  of  opting 

for  the  V.S.S.-2020.  The  question  whether  the 

petitioners  were  coerced  into  opting  for  V.S.S.-

2020  is  a  controversial  question  of  fact  which 

cannot  be 

resolved 

in 

the  constitutional 

jurisdiction  of 

this  Court.  The  Mandatory 

Separation  Scheme  dated  29.12.2020  was 

floated  by  the  P.I.A.C.  after  the  deadline  of 

22.12.2020 for opting for V.S.S.-2020. Therefore, 

on  the  basis  of  the  documents  on  the  record  it 

cannot be held that the petitioners were coerced 

into opting for V.S.S.-2020.  

8.  By virtue of section 3(1) of the 2016 Act, the 

P.I.A.C.  was  converted  into  a  public  company 

limited by shares with effect from the date of the 

enactment  of  the  said  Act.  Section  3(6)(iii)  and 

(iv)  of  the  2016  Act  provides  that  the  salaries  of 

employees,  emoluments  and  all  other  terms  of 

service  of  employees,  whether  permanent  or 

contractual,  shall  not  be  changed  to  their 

disadvantage;  and  pensions  and  other  existing 

obligations  of  the  P.I.A.C.  to  retired  employees 

shall  not  be  changed  to  their  disadvantage. 

These  provisions  cannot  be  stretched  to  be 

made applicable to the employees who opt for a 

Voluntary  Separation  Scheme,  which  is  purely 

contractual 

in  nature.  The  said  provision 

provides  protection  of  the  terms  and  conditions 

of  service  to  the  employees  of  P.I.A.C.  upon 

conversion  of  P.I.A.C. 

into  a  public 

limited 

company and do not apply to the employees who 

voluntarily  opt  for  and  obtain  benefits  under 

V.S.S. 

9. 

In  the  case  of  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  VS 

Imtiaz Ali Khan (2012 SCMR 280), the respondent 

had  opted  for  the  Voluntary  Golden  Handshake 

Scheme 

introduced  by 

the  State  Bank  of 

 
4 

W.P. No.3437/2021 

Pakistan  that  offered  a  voluntary  exit  to  its 

employees  on  payment  of  retirement  benefits 

under  the  existing  rules  in  addition  to  other 

normal  benefits  as  compensation.  The  writ 

petition filed by the respondent was accepted by 

the  Hon'ble  High  Court  directing  the  State  Bank 

of  Pakistan 

to  pay  commutation  on 

the 

respondent’s  gross  pension  irrespective  of  the 

Golden  Handshake  Scheme.  The  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court, while allowing the State Bank of 

Pakistan’s  appeal  against  the  judgment  of  the 

Hon'ble  High  Court,  held  inter  alia  that  the 

respondent  had  not  retired  from  service  by 

application  of  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan’s 

Regulations  but  only  after  he  had  voluntarily 

accepted the Golden Handshake Scheme, which 

was  to  govern  his  case.  In  paragraph  28  of  the 

said report, it was held as follows:- 

“28.  Since the respondent-employees have not 
retired from service of the appellant-Bank by 
application of the Regulations, 1980 nor under 
the Staff Regulations, 1993 but they have left 
the service of the appellant-Bank at their own 
exercising  their  own  right  of  option  by 
accepting the Scheme, therefore, their cases 
are squarely governed and controlled under the 
terms and conditions as was clearly spelt out in 
the Scheme itself. As no reference can be made 
as to how and against whom the respondents 
were  differently  treated  in  a  discriminatory 
manner, we have failed to understand as to how 
there was any violation of Article 25 of the 
Constitution.” 

(Emphasis added) 

10.  The  door  of 

this  Court  exercising 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  cannot  be  left  ajar  for 

the retired  employees of P.I.A.C. who had opted 

to avail the benefits under the V.S.S.-2020, I say 

this,  because  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  in  the 

case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Company 

Limited VS Iqbal Nasir (PLD 2011 S.C. 132) held 

as follows:- 

 
 
5 

W.P. No.3437/2021 

“29.   As to the case of the employees seeking 
the benefit of VS, no relief could be granted 
to them by the High Court in view of the non-
maintainability of their writ petitions on the 
ground that their services were not governed 
by any statutory rules and even the VS was 
not offered under, or in terms of, any statutory 
provisions.” 
(Emphasis added) 

11.  On  the  basis  of  the  law  laid  down  by  the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Pakistan 

Telecommunication  Company  Limited  VS  Iqbal 

Nasir  (supra),  this  Court,  vide  order  dated 

16.02.2017, dismissed a number of writ petitions 

as  not  maintainable  wherein  retired  employees 

of  Pakistan 

Telecommunication  Company 

Limited  had  sought  to 

impeach  the  V.S.S. 

entered  into  by  them  on  the  ground  that  they 

were coerced or arm-twisted into doing so. 

12.  Additionally,  the Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court 

vide  judgment  dated  27.05.2016  passed  in  writ 

petition No.5978/2011 titled S.M. Abu Talib Naqvi 

VS President/Chief Executive Officer PTCL  held 

that  the  petitioners  who  had  availed  the  V.S.S. 

package  were  not  entitled  to  the  relief  granted 

vide Finance Division’s Office Memoranda issued 

on  05.07.2010  regarding  increase  in  pension, 

medical allowance and in family pension. 

13.  In  view  of  the  above,  I  hold  that  the  instant 

petition is not maintainable and consequently the 

same is dismissed in limine.
