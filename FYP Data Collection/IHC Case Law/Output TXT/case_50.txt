Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary. 

Ch. Muhammad Atif, Advocate for the petitioner  

Learned counsel at the outset states that the address of respondent no.3 

ex-wife, in whose favour the decree for recovery of Rs.5,000/- and 6 tolas gold 

was given, is  not traceable, and the service on her could not be  effected as a 

result.    He  also  added  that  the  execution  petition  filed  by  the  ex-wife  stands 

consigned to record because she ceased to pursue the said execution petition.  

With the execution petition consigned to record, there is no real prospect of the 

recovery  of  the  money  and  the  gold  from  the  petitioner.    Resultantly,  the 

exercise  in  deciding  this  petition  may  be  of  an  academic  value  only,  and  the 

time to be spent in hearing and deciding this petition can usefully be spent by 

this Court on another case.

Resultantly,  this  petition  is  adjourned  sine  die  until,  if  at  all,  the 

execution petition is reactivated by respondent no.3.
