GHULAM AZAM  QAMBRANI.  J 

The  petitioner  [Muhammad  Nazakat Hussain] seeks 

cancellation  of  bail  granted  in  favour  of  accused/ 

respondent  No.1,  in  case  FIR  No.  584/2018,  dated 

24.12.2018,  under  sections  324/34,  337-F  (II),  337-F 

(I)  PPC, registered at Police Station Koral, Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts of the case are that the complainant/ 

petitioner  lodged the  FIR with  the  allegations  that  on 

23.12.2018  at  about  03.00  PM  accused/respondent 

No.1  alongwith  unknown  accused,  armed  with  pistol 

30-bore came at  spot  on  a  motorcycle  and fired  with 

30-bore pistol at son of complainant namely lhtasham 

Nazakat who sustained  injuries. Complainant and the 

friend of his son tried to catch them but they fled away 

from  the  spot  while  leaving  the  bike.  Motive  behind 

the  occurrence  has  been  alleged  as  the  accused 

party  forbade 

the  son  of  complainant 

to  have 

friendship  with  one  Junaid,  and  for  this  reason,  they 

severally threatened him, hence the instant FIR. 

3. 

Learned counsel for the  petitioner submits that 

learned  Trial  Court  while  passing  the  bail  granting 

order  has  failed  to  appreciate  that  the  accused/ 

respondent  No.1  remained  absconder  for  more  than 

five  months;  that  the  impugned  order  is  against  the 

law  and  facts  of  the  case;  that  the  recovery  was 

effected 

from 

the  accused/ 

respondent  No.1 

mentioned in the  FIR, but this  fact  has  been  ignored 

while  passing the  impugned order; that the  impugned 

2 

CRL.MISC. N0.720-BC  /2019 

order  has  been  passed  without  applying 

the 

independent judicial  mind;  that  accused/  respondent 

No.1 

is  misusing the concession of bail and constantly 

harassing the petitioner and his family. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondent  No.1/ 

accused  contended 

that 

the 

accused/ 

respondent  No.1  did  not  misuse 

the 

concession  of  bail  nor  did  he  ever  threaten  the 

complainant or his family  in  any manner; that the  FIR 

has been lodged against him on the basis of false and 

baseless  allegations.  The 

learned  State  Counsel 

opposed the contention of the learned counsel for the 

petitioner  and  supported  the  bail  granting  order 

passed by the learned Trial Court. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Minute  perusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the 

FIR was lodged after a  delay of one day; the accused/ 

respondent  No.1  was  arrested  on  02.05.2019  and 

nothing  has  been  effected  from  him.  Prima facie,  no 

incriminating  material  is  available  on  record  against 

the  accused.  The  investigation  has  already  been 

completed  and  accused  is  no  more  required  to  the 

police  for  further  investigation.  The  co-accused  of 

respondent  No.1  have  already  been  discharged  by 

the learned Judicial Magistrate. The guilt or otherwise 

of the accused/  respondent  No.1  shall be determined 

after recording of prosecution evidence by the learned 

trial  Court.  With  regard  to  threats  extended  by  the 

respondent  No.1/ 

accused 

to 

the  prosecution 

witnesses, the  petitioner failed to  bring on  record any 

report with  regard to extending  of threats.  Further the 

absconsion  itself  cannot  be  used  to  kill  each  and 

every  right of  accused  and  it  should  not  come  in  the 

way for  refusal of bail and the  same cannot  be made 

a  ground for  cancellation  of  bail.  Mere absconsion  of 

the accused/ respondent No.1  is  not sufficient ground 

to connect him with the offence. 

7. 

The  considerations  for  the  grant  of  bail  are 

quite  different 

from 

the  considerations 

for 

the 

cancellation of  bail. Once  bail has  been granted  by a 

competent  Court  of  law,  strong  and  exceptional 

3 

CRL.MISC.  N0.720-BC 

/2019 

grounds are required for cancelling the same.  In  such 

cases,  it  is  to  be  seen  as  to  whether  order  granting 

bail  is  patently  illegal,  erroneous,  factually  incorrect 

and  has 

resulted 

in  miscarriage  of 

justice. 

Considering  the  case  of  present  respondent  No.1/ 

accused for the grant of bail on the above touchstone, 

I  am  of the  view  that  the  learned  District  &  Sessions 

Judge  has  rightly  exercised  the  grant  of  bail  to  the 

respondent No.1  I accused. 

8. 

So  far  as  the  allegation  of  misuse  of  the 

concession of bail by the accused/ respondent No. 1  is 

concerned, in  this  regard the  petitioner has miserably 

failed  to  bring  on  record  any  material  evidence.  The 

petitioner  has  also  failed  to  point  out  whether  after 

grant  of  bail  the  accused/  respondent  has  tampered 

with 

the  prosecution  evidence  or  misused 

the 

concession  of  bail.  In  this  regard  reliance  has  been 

placed on the Judgments titled  11  The  State VS  Khalid 

Mehmood"  [2006  SCMR  1265)  &  11  Ahsan  Akbar  VS 

The State" [ 2007 SCMR 482). 

9. 

For  the 

foregoing  reasons,  no  reasonable 

grounds  exist  for  cancellation  of  bail  granted  to  the 

accused/  respondent  No.1, 

therefore,  the 

instant 

petition being devoid of force, is  hereby dismissed. 

10. 

However, the  observations  made  hereinabove 

are meant for  disposal of this  application, which  shall 

have no bearing on merits of the case.
