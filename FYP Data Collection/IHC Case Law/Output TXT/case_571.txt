               (1)                  15.03.2022.  Mr.  Arshad  Anwar,  Advocate 

for 

the 

Petitioner.   

Through  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

assailed  Order  dated  14.02.2022  (“Impugned 

Order”)  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court-East, Islamabad, whereby, present Petitioner 

has  been  directed  to  pay  interim  maintenance  to 

Respondents No. 2 & 3 at the rate of Rs. 12,000/- 

per  month  each  and  to  continue  payment  of 

monthly school fee of Respondent No. 2 at the rate 

of  Rs.  23,720/-  per  month  directly  to  concerned 

school and to submit  its receipt before the learned 

Trial Court.    

2. 

Facts, in brief, as per Memo of Petition, are 

that  earlier,  Respondent  No.  1  filed  a  suit  for 

dissolution  of  marriage 

and 

recovery  of 

maintenance  which  was  dismissed  as  withdrawn 

vide  order  dated  09.09.2017  upon  the  apology  of 

the 

Petitioner 

to 

improve 

his 

attitude. 

Subsequently, 

however, 

according 

to 

the 

Petitioner,  the  Respondent  No.  1  left  the  house  of 

the  Petitioner  with  mala  fide  intentions  and  once 

 
 
 
 
2|W.P No. 1044/2022. 

again  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance.   

3. 

The  learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  East-

Islamabad  vide  the  Impugned  Order  fixed  the 

interim  monthly  maintenance  of  Respondent  No.2 

&  3  as  aforesaid  to  be  paid  before  14th  of  each 

calendar  month  along  with  monthly  school  fee  of 

Respondent  No.  2.  The  Petitioner  has  assailed  the 

Impugned Order through instant petition.  

4. 

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted 

that the learned Trial Court has not considered and 

appreciated  the  financial  status  of  the  Petitioner 

and  the  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  on  the 

basis  of  misreading  and  non-reading  of 

the 

record/pleadings; that the Impugned order has been 

passed  while  relying  on  surmises  and  conjectures; 

that  Respondent  No.  1  is  disobedient,  hence  not 

entitled  for  any  maintenance  and  as  such  has 

prayed for setting aside of the Impugned Order.  

5. 

The  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  in 

pursuance  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act, 1964, where under the Family 

Court has the jurisdiction to pass interim order for 

maintenance  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  in  a 

suit  for  maintenance.  The  purpose  behind  the 

provision  of  interim  maintenance  is  to  ensure  that 

during  the  pendency  of  the  legal  proceedings,  the 

minors are not faced with financial challenges. 

6. 

Section  14  (3)  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

 
3|W.P No. 1044/2022. 

against an interim order passed by a Family Court 

with the obvious purpose to avoid delays.  

7. 

The 

Impugned  Order 

is  merely 

an 

interlocutory order. The maintenance fixed through 

such  an  order  is  only  temporary.  The  quantum  of 

maintenance  may be  modified after appraising the 

evidence produced at trial. An aggrieved party will 

have  a  right  to  agitate  his  grievance  before  the 

appellate Court when the interim order merges into 

a  final  order.  Even  otherwise,  quantum  of  interim 

maintenance,  being  a  factual  dispute  cannot  be 

made  a  ground  for  invoking  the  Constitutional 

jurisdiction of this Court.  

8. 

I am guided by the consistent view taken by 

different  Honorable  Benches  of  the  Islamabad 

High  Court, 

Islamabad 

in  various  matters 

including 

the  reported  cases  of  Dr.  Aqueel 

Waris VSIbrahim  Aqueel  Waris,  2020  CLC 

131;  [      ],  2018  CLC  506;  Mashkoor  Ahmed 

Khokhar VSThe  Family 

Judge 

(East), 

Islamabad,  2019  CLC  1635;  Muhammad 

Touseeq  Danial  Bhatti VSAyesha  Naeem, 

2021  MLD 

337; 

and 

Aamir  Munir 

Puri VSMst.  Saima  Naeem,  2021  YLR  2166, 

wherein  it  has  been  held  that  interlocutory  orders 

by 

the  Family  Court  cannot  be  assailed 

in 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  even  though  they  may 

be harsh in some instances. The instant petition is, 

therefore, not maintainable. 

9. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  said  discussion 

and  keeping  in  view  the  above  said  observations 

 
 
4|W.P No. 1044/2022. 

by  this  Court  in  the  aforementioned  cases  the 

Impugned  Order  dated  14.02.2022  passed  by  the 

learned Judge, Family Court, East-Islamabad, does 

not  call  for 

interference 

in  writ 

jurisdiction.  

Consequently, 

this  Writ  Petition 

is  hereby 

dismissed in limine.
