Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.

Nemo. 

The case was called time and again, 

even  it  was  taken  up  at  late  hours  but  no  one 

has  put  an  appearance  on  behalf  of  the 

petitioner.  The  name  of  the  counsel  for  the 

petitioner is reflected in the cause list. There is 

no  application  for  adjournment.  The  matter 

pertains  to  the  year  2015,  it  seems  that no  one 

is  serious  in  pursuing  the  case,  therefore,  the 

instant  petition 

is  dismissed 

for  non-

prosecution.
