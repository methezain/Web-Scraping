proceeding 

Order with signature of Judge, and that of parties or counsel, where 
necessary.  

                  15.03.2021  Barrister Farooq Iqbal Khan for petitioner. 

Raja  Inam  Amin  Minhas  and  Ch.  Waqas 
Zamir, Advocates for Respondents. 

The  petitioner,  Muhammad  Atif,  through 

instant  writ  petition  has  assailed  order  dated 

21.12.2020, passed by learned Judge Family Court, 

West-Islamabad,  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  Trial 

Court),  whereby  the  learned  Trial  Court  directed 

the petitioner to pay monthly interim maintenance 

at the rate of Rs.20,000/- to Respondent Nos.2 & 3 

(total Rs. 40,000/-).  

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended 

that  the  interim  maintenance  fixed  is  beyond  his 

capacity  and  he  cannot  afford to  pay  Rs.  40,000/- 

per  month  as 

interim  maintenance  of 

the 

Respondents No.  2 & 3 on the ground that he is a 

government  servant  dependent  on  salary  of  Rs. 

80,000/-  per  month  and  has  no  other  source  of 

income. He submitted that the learned Trial Court 

has  failed  to  appreciate  the  said  facts  and  has 

passed the impugned order by imposing exorbitant 

interim maintenance for the children.  

3. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

Respondents while supporting the impugned order 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P a g e  | 2 
W.P.No. 381/2021 

submitted  that  the  petitioner  is  a  man  of  means 

who is responsible for taking care of the needs of 

his  children  and  prayed  for  dismissal  of  present 

petition.  

4. 

Arguments  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  have  been  heard  and  available  record 

including  the  impugned  order  has  also  been 

perused. 

5. 

The  learned  Trial  Court,  vide  impugned 

order  dated  21.12.2020  has 

fixed 

interim 

maintenance for 2 children of the petitioner, which 

he  has  assailed  herein  by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  court  under 

Article  199(1)(a)(ii)  of 

the  Constitution  of 

Pakistan, 1973, and has prayed for setting-aside of 

the  impugned  interim  order,  whereby,  the  learned 

Trial  Court  has  passed  order  in  terms  of  section 

17-A  of  the  Family  Court  Act,  1964  (hereinafter 

referred  to  as  the  Act,  1964)  which  provision 

empowers  the  learned  Family  Court  to  fix  a 

provisional  monthly  maintenance  keeping  in view 

the income of the father during the proceedings in 

the  suit  of  maintenance  till  its  decision.  The 

findings  of  the  learned  Family  Court  in  the 

impugned order are only tentative in nature and not 

final. Whereas, proper quantum of the maintenance 

allowance  is  fixed  by  the  learned  Family  Court, 

after  recording  of  evidence  as  the  issue  of  final 

maintenance requires probe into the facts regarding 

financial status and source of income and the High 

Courts 

should 

refrain 

from 

involving 

in 

determination  of  facts,  being  beyond  the  scope  of 

Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution, 1973, for 

 
 
  
P a g e  | 3 
W.P.No. 381/2021 

the  reason  that  such  jurisdiction  is  exercised  only 

against  the  act  done  or  proceedings  taken  by  the 

functionary which are without lawful authority and 

of no legal effect. Guidance in this regard has been 

sought  from  the  case  law  reported  as  Ghulam 

Muhammad  and  another  VS Mst.  Noor  Bibi 

and  others  (1980  SCMR  933),  Benedict  F.D 

Souza VSKarachi Building Control Authority 

and  others  (1989  SCMR  918)  and  Federation  of 

Pakistan  and  others  VS Major 

(Retd.) 

Muhammad Sabir Khan (PLD 1991 SC 476).  

6. 

A  learned  Single  Bench  of  this  Hon’ble 

Court in a similar case titled as  Dr. Aqueel Waris 

VSIbrahim Aqueel Waris (2020 CLC 131) has 

held  that  interlocutory  orders  of  Family  Court 

cannot  be  assailed  in  constitutional  jurisdiction  of 

the  High  court.  Moreover,  father  should  not  be 

punished  by  way  of 

interim  maintenance 

allowance  for  a  period  more  than  one  month. 

Relevant  portion  of 

the  said 

judgment 

is 

reproduced hereunder:- 

the 

“18. While applying the above principles in present 
scenario,  when  the  petitioner/father  has  taken  the 
plea that since he is left with 555 in his hand after 
deduction of tax and payment of other expenses, he 
could  not  pay 
interim  maintenance  of 
Rs.50,000/-  per  month  to  the  minor/respondent 
No.1, which prima facie seems to be on higher side 
at  this  stage,  but  this  Court,  in  constitutional 
jurisdiction,  is  not  able  to  determine  this  factual 
aspect  of  adequacy  or  inadequacy  of  the  interim 
maintenance  allowance  on  the  basis  of  principles 
laid  down  by  the  superior  Courts,  where  such 
order  could  not  be  assailed  in  constitutional 
jurisdiction.  However,  in  order  to  avoid  any 
conflict,  the  Judge  Family  Court  is  directed  to 
decide  the  pending  maintenance  suit  within  the 
period  of  one  month  while  recording  the  evidence 
on  day  to  day  basis  so  that  the  father/petitioner 
could  only  be  burdened  with 
interim 
maintenance  of  Rs.50,000/-  for  a  month,  which 
final 
would  be  subsequently  merged  into 

the 

the 

 
P a g e  | 4 
W.P.No. 381/2021 

judgment  or  in  case  it  may  be  decreased  or 
otherwise on the basis of evidence.”. 

7. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  of  above  said 

discussion and keeping in view the the above said 

observations  recorded  by  a  learned  Single  Bench 

of  this  Hon’ble  Court  in  case  supra,  instant 

petition is hereby dismissed. However, the Family 

Court is directed to conclude the trial and finalize 

the suit within a period of thirty days from the date 

of receipt of this order.
