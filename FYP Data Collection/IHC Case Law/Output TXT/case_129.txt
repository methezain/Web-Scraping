Nemo. 

The matter is at motion stage. On the last date 

i.e.  18.01.2022 

the 

learned  counsel  for 

the 

Petitioners  had  sought 

time 

to 

file  some 

documents. Today none is in attendance on behalf 

of  the  Petitioner.    It  is  clear  that  the  Petitioners 

have  lost  interest  in  the  lis.  As  such  the  instant 

Writ Petition is dismissed for non-prosecution.
