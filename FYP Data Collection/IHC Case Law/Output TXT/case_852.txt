Order with  signature of  Judge and 
that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessa  . 
Mr.  Muhammad  Umair  Baloch, Advocate 
for the  petitioner. 

The  petitioner  has  filed  the  instant 

writ  petition  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution  of 

Islamic  Republic  of 

Pakistan,  1973.  The  petitioner 

has 

challenged  orders  dated  24.06.2021  and 

10.09.2021,  whereby  major  penalty  of 

reduction  from  the  post  of  Upper  Division 

Clerk  (BPS-11)  to  Lower  Division  Clerk 

(BPS-09), was imposed. 

02. 

Succinctly  stated  facts  of  the  case 

are  that  after  death  of  his  father,  the 

petitioner  being  a  nominee  of  bereaved 

family  was  appointed  as  UDC  (BPS-11) in 

the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib 

(Ombudsman)'s 

2 

Writ  Petjtjoo No.  4663 of  2021 

Secretariat, 

Islamabad  on  11.12.2017, 

under  Prime Minister's Assistance Package 

for families of Government Employees who 

died in  service. 

03. 

In  order  to  implicate  the  petitioner 

in  a  false case  out of  malice, the  petitioner 

was 

issued  charge  sheet  along  with 

statement  of  allegations,  after  conducting 

an  inquiry  major  penalty  of  reduction  to 

the  post  of  L.D.C  (BPS-09) was  imposed 

vide  impugned  order  dated  24.06.2021. 

Thereafter,  the  petitioner  filed  an  appeal 

under Civil  Servants (Appeal)  Rules,  1977, 

Additional  Secretary 

(Admn) 

being 

Appellate  authority  has  dismissed  the 

appeal  vide  order  dated  26.07.2021  and 

uphold 

the  penalty 

imposed  by 

the 

authority  under  Rule  6(1)(c)  of  the  Civil 

Servants (Appeal)  Rules,  1977,  hence the 

instant writ  petition. 

04. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter  a/ia contends  that  impugned  orders 

dated  24.06.2021 and  10.09.2021 are void 

ab 

initio, 

illegal,  unlawful,  arbitrary, 

3 

Writ  Petition No.  4663 of  2021 

preposterous and against the  rights  of the 

petitioner,  hence liable to  be  set-aside. 

05. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

06. 

It  is  evident  from  the 

impugned 

orders  that  the  petitioner  is  working  on 

contract  basis  under  Prime  Minister 

Assistance  Package 

for 

families  of 

Government  Employees  but  surprisingly 

the  fact  that  the  petitioner  is  contractual 

employee  has  not  been  mentioned  in  the 

contents  of  the  petition.  Perusal  of  record 

further  reveals  that  contract  employment 

letter  is  also  not  enclosed with  the  instant 

petition,  on  the  basis  of  which,  the  terms 

and  conditions  of  the  appointment  and 

date  of  expiry  of  contract  could  be 

ascertained.  As  the  laws  applicable  for 

regular 

appointment 

and 

contract 

appointment  are  altogether  different. 

When  confronted, 

learned  counsel  has 

admitted  that  the  said  fact  has  not  been 

mentioned  and  the  contract  appointment 

letter  is  also  not  enclosed with  the  instant 

4 

Writ  Petition No. 4663 of 2021 

petition  and  has  further  stated  that  the 

same will  be  provided lateron. 

07. 

It  is  trite  that  for  discretionary  and 

equitable  relief,  it  is  pre-condition  that  the 

parties  should  approach  the  Courts  with 

clean  hands,  in  order  to  get  the  relief.  It 

has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan 

in  a  case 

titled  as 

Shafqatullah  and  others  VS  District 

and  Sessions  .Judge,  Nowshera, 

N. W.F.P and  4  others  (2001  SCMR 

274),  that:- 

"It  would  also  appear  from  the 

record  that  the  petitioners  did  not 

approach the High Court with  clean 

hands  entitling 

them 

to 

the 

discretionary, equitable relief  under 

the Constitutional jurisdiction'~ 

Reliance  may  also  be  placed  upon  a  case 

titled  as  Manzoor  Hussain  and  3 

others 

VS  Muhammad  Siddique 

(2000  CLC 623 [Lahore lJ. 

08.  Charge  sheet  dated  25.02.2021, 

was  issued,  wherein  following  allegations 

were mentioned: 

5 

Writ  Petition No. 4663 of 2021 

"WHEREAS, you  Mr. Rizwan Ahmed, 

UDC  (BS-11),  working 

in 

this 

Secretariat on contract  basis, under 

the  Prime  Minster  Assistance 

Package for  employees who  die 

during  service, have committed  the 

following  acts  of  omission  & 

commission: 

You  have  been  alleged  in 

submitting  applications  to  different 

authorities  of AJK &  Government of 

Pakistan, against  your  opponents 

pertaining 

to  your  personal 

/ 

property  disputes etc  by  using the 

umbrella  of  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib 

Secretariat.  It 

is  revealed  from 

record  that  prior  to  the  in  service 

death of your father Mr. Muhammad 

Yasin, ex-Naib Qasid (late}  and your 

appointment  in  the  Secretariat  in 

2017, you had been submitting  such 

applications  in  the  name  of  your 

deceased father. You have also been 

involved  in  disoatching  fake letters 

with  bogus signatures of  the official 

of 

this  Secretariat 

to  different 

authorities  against  your  opponents 

and affixing  stamos of  Law Section 

of the Wafaqi Mohtasib Secretariat. 

Despite  issuance of  several 

warnings, you  did  not  mend  your 

attitude 

and 

still 

continued 

submitting  applications in  the name 

of  your  mother 

to 

the  higher 

authorities  of  this  Secretariat  for 

withdrawal of  warnings and alleging 

that  warnings were issued to  you 

6 

Writ  Petjtjoo No.  4663 of 2021 

un-necessarily.  Your behavior in  this 

regard is questionable." 

09. 

The  petitioner  submitted  reply  of 

charge  sheet,  which  was  not 

found 

satisfactory,  consequently  Show  cause 

Notice  was  issued  on  21.05.2021  and 

inquiry  committee  comprising  of  Senior 

Officers  of  the  Hon'ble  Wafaqi  Mohtasib 

(Ombudsman)'s 

Secretariat 

was 

constituted.  During  the  course  of  inquiry, 

the  petitioner  has  admitted  in  writing  the 

allegation  mentioned  in  the  charge  sheet 

that  he  used  the  official  stamp  of  the  Law 

Section of Wafaqi Mohtasib Secretariat but 

stated that  warning was issued to  him  and 

after 

issuance  of  warning  he  has  not 

committed  any mis-conduct. 

10. 

It  was recommended by the  inquiry 

committee  that  the  petitioner  was  found 

guilty  of  mis-conduct in  terms  of  Rule  2(k) 

of 

the  Civil  Servants  (Efficiency  and 

Discipline  Rules,  2020),  to  the  extent  of 

influencing  his  neighbours  /  relatives  by 

using  the  name  of  Wafaqi  Mohtasib  qua 

7 

Writ  Petition No.  4663 of  2021 

embossing  official  stamps  and 

forging 

bogus  signatures  of  an  official  of  Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  on  his  personal  applications. 

Therefore,  it  was recommended to  impose 

major  penalty  upon the  petitioner  /  official 

in  terms  of  Rule  4(3)( d)  i.e.  removal from 

service for  continuously tainting  the  image 

of 

the  prestigious  organization  being 

involved  in  malpractices  as  discussed  in 

detail  in 

the  inquiry  report,  hence  the 

major  penalty  for  reduction  from  the  post 

of  U.D.C  (BPS-11)  to  the  post  of  L.D.C 

(BPS-09)  was  imposed.  Thereafter,  the 

appeal  was  filed  which  has  also  been 

dismissed  vide 

impugned  order  dated 

10.09.2021, by  the competent  authority. 

11. 

Admittedly, 

the 

petitioner 

is 

contractual  employee  and  the  superior 

Courts  in  various  pronouncements  settled 

the 

law 

that,  contract  employee 

is 

debarred from  approaching the  High  Court 

in  its  constitutional  jurisdiction.  The  only 

remedy available to  a  contract  employee is 

to  file  a  suit  for  damages  against  the 

8 

Writ  Petjtjoo No.  4663 of 2021 

employer, 

in 

case  of  any  violation. 

Reliance in  this  regard  is  placed upon the 

cases  titled  as  Qazi Munir  Ahmed  VS 

Rawalpindi  Medical  College  and 

Allied Hospital (2019  SCMR 648) and 

Federation  of  Pakistan 

through 

Secretary 

Law, 

Justice 

and 

Parliamentary Affairs  VS  Muhammad 

Azam Chattha (2013  SCMR 120). 

12. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of  Pakistan in  a  case titled 

as  Owais Shams Durrani  and  others 

VS  Vice-Chancellor,  Bacha  Khan 

University,  Charsadda and  another 

(2020 SCMR 1041) that: 

"It  is  trite  that  where a  citizen 

seeks  relief 

in  constitutional 

jurisdiction  he must  point  to  a 

right  statutory  or  constitutional 

which vests in him and has been 

denied in  violation of the law'. 

In  this  regard,  reliance  may  also  be  placed 

upon  the  case  titled  as  N. W.F.P Public 

Service Commission and  others  VS 

Muhammad Arif  and  others  (2011 

SCMR848). 

9 

Writ  Petition No.  4663 of 2021 

13.  As 

the 

learned  counsel  for 

the 

petitioner  has  failed to  point  out  that  how 

the 

respondents  have  committed  any 

violation  of 

law,  rule  and 

regulation 

applicable  to  the  petitioner  rather  the 

petitioner  himself  has  admitted  that  he 

was  involved  in  committing  gross  mis- 

conduct. 

14. 

In 

view 

foregoing 

discussion, 

instant  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable, 

hence the  same  is  dismissed in  limine 

being merit  less  with  no  order as  to  costs.  Â·
