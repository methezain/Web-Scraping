MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:-  Through  this  single  judgment, 

I  intend  to  decide  both  the  aforementioned  writ  petitions  as  identical 

question of law and facts are involved in both these writ petitions. 

2. 

The petitioner/Shifa Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. through WP No.2303/2009 

has  assailed  the  Test  Reports  No.82  to  84/2009  dated  27.04.2009,  Test 

Reports  No.FP-05  to  12/2009  dated  04.05.2009,  Test  Reports  FP-24  to 

41/2009  dated  15.05.2009  and  Test  Reports  No.31  to  13-M/2009  dated 

30.05.2009,  issued  by  Central  Drugs  Laboratory  Karachi  as  well  as 

Certificate  of  Test  of  Analysis  by  the  Drugs  Control  and  Traditional 

Medicines  Division,  National  Institute  of  Health,  Islamabad.  Whereas,  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [2] 

petitioner/Shifa  Laboratories  Pvt.  Ltd.  Through  WP  No.267/2010  has 

assailed  the  order  dated  06.11.2009  which  was  communicated  through 

letter  dated  25.11.2009  issued  by  Drugs  Registration  Board,  Ministry  of 

Health,  Government  of  Pakistan,  whereby  the  registration  of  drug 

(Paracetamol  500mg,  Registration  No.010449)  of  the  petitioner  company 

has been cancelled.  

3. 

Brief  facts  as  extracted  from  both  the  writ  petitions  are  that  the 

Shifa  Laboratories  Pvt  Ltd.,  the  petitioner  company,  deals  with  the 

manufacturing  and  sales  of  standard  quality  medicines  in  Pakistan  for  the 

last 50 years on the basis of valid  drugs manufacturing license granted by 

Central Licensing Board, including the Paracetamol Tablet 500mg.  

4. 

The petitioner company had participated in the tender for the supply 

of  pharmaceutical  tablet  of  500mg,  being  successful  bidder,  a  pre-award 

contract  notification  was  issued  on  17.12.2007  for  the  supply  of 

Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  to  National  Program  for  Family  Planning  and 

Family  Healthcare  and  Reproductive  Health  Project,  Ministry  of  Health  for 

the year 2007-08. The contract was awarded to the petitioner company  at 

the  rate  of  Rs.47.37/-  per  pack  for  whole  number  of  1,522,899  packs 

against  the  total  consideration  of  Rs.72,139,725.63  (rupees  seventy  two 

millions one hundred thirty nine thousand seven hundred twenty five paisa 

sixty three only). 

5. 

Contract  was  executed  on  07.02.2008  whereby  the  petitioner 

company  had 

completed 

the 

consignment 

and 

supplied 

the 

product/medicines whereafter random samples from different batches were 

inspected  on  17.03.2008,  05.05.2008,  05.08.2008  and  30.10.2008  by  the 

Inspection Committee which were sent for test analysis to the Central Drugs 

Laboratory  Karachi,  whereupon  the  same  were  declared  to  be  of  standard 

quality vide Certificate of Test Analysis by Central Drugs Laboratory Karachi.  

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [3] 

6. 

As  per  claim  of  the  petitioner,  they  had  only  received  50%  of  the 

total sale considerations of Rs.72,139,725.63/- and upon claiming the entire 

consideration up till November 2008, they had received a show cause notice 

from  the  Federal  Inspector  of  Drugs  Hyderabad,  Karachi  and  Federal 

Inspector  of  Drugs,  Peshawar  on  the  ground  that  samples  of  Paracetamol 

Tablet 500mg taken from Hyderabad and Peshawar have been declared of 

substandard  quality  by  the  Central  Drugs  Laboratory  Karachi,  whereby 

notice  was  issued  from  Federal  Inspector  of  Drugs,  Hyderabad  dated 

28.04.2009  which  was  duly  replied.  The  petitioner  received  three  show 

cause notices from the office of respondent No.2  Drugs Registration Board 

Ministry  of  Health,  Government  of  Pakistan.  In  view  of  above  background 

WP No.2303/09 was filed whereby the  Test  Reports  have been assailed in 

which 

Paracetamol 

Tablet 

500mg 

has 

been 

declared 

of 

“sub-standard quality” under the Drugs Act, 1976.  

7. 

This  Court  vide  order  dated  24.06.2009  entertained  the  instant  writ 

petition  (old  WP  No.1114/2009)  and  passed  the  restraining  order  on  CM 

No.2804/2009 with the following terms: 

“CM No.2804-09 
3.  Notice. In the meanwhile, further proceedings in the 
matter shall remain stayed till next date of hearing.” 

After  the  passing  of  order  dated  24.06.2009,  the  respondents  on 

02.07.2009 had requested for time to file rejoinder, however, subsequently 

the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad was declared unconstitutional by the 

Apex  Court  in  case  titled  Sindh High Court Bar Association v/s FOP. 

Nevertheless, Drugs Registration Board issued another show cause notice to 

the petitioner vide office letter dated 05.11.2009 to appear before the board 

in its 221st meeting held on 06.11.2009 at Pak Secretariat, Islamabad which  

the  petitioner  company  replied  through  letter  dated  05.11.2009  and 

requested  the  Drugs  Registration  Board  that  the  matter  is  pending  before 

the  High  Court  and  interim  injunction  has  been  granted  in  this  regard  but 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [4] 

the  Drugs  Registration  Board  in  utter  disregard  of  all  norms  of  natural 

justice  cancelled 

the 

registration  of 

(Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg, 

Registration  No.010449)  manufactured  by  the  petitioner  through  letter 

dated 25.11.2009 issued by the Drugs Registration Board, Islamabad.  

8. 

The  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner,  in  WP  No.2303/09,  started  his 

arguments  by  putting  in  plain  words  that  Article  4  of  the  Constitution 

provides  equal  protection  of  law  and  any  act  done,  order  passed  or 

proceedings initiated in violation of status quo order are against  the rights 

given under Article 4. The learned counsel for petitioner further argued that 

the  test  reports  of  Central  Drugs  Laboratory  No.SC  82  to  84/2009  dated 

27.04.2009 Annexure-U/1 to U/3, Test reports Nos.FP.05 to 12/2009 dated 

04.05.2009  Annexure-W/1  to  W/8,  and  Test  Report  Nos.FP  24  to  41/2009 

dated  15.05.2009  Annexure-Y/1  to  Y/18,  are  in  clear  violation  of  the 

mandatory  requirements  of  Rule  16  of  the  Drugs  (Federal  Inspectors, 

Federal  Drugs  Laboratory  and  Federal  Government  Analyst)  Rules 1976  as 

the  Government  Analyst  failed  to  give  the  details  and  full  protocols  of  the 

test applied. 

9. 

The  learned  counsel  for  petitioner  also  borrowed  the  opinion  of 

Hon’ble Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore laid down in cases, 

i.e., ICA Nos.127 and 128 of 1989 titled Provincial Quality Control Board and 

other VS Irza Pharma and others, that:- 

“…. When the basic test report does not conform with the 
provision  of  law,  it  is  wholly  without  jurisdiction  and 
incapable to be acted upon. Hence, asking the respondent to 
choose the aforesaid remedy is nothing but to perpetuate 
the tyranny. Hence, we repel the contention and we also 
disapprove the action taken otherwise than law which is 
nothing but amounts to tyranny of law, and the citizens are 
to be saved therefrom.” 

The  learned  counsel  for  petitioner  claimed  that  after  the  above  referred 

judgments, sending the samples for re-test to National Institute of Health is 

also without jurisdiction. 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [5] 

10. 

The  learned  counsel  for  petitioner  further  argued  and  raised  a 

question  that  Dr.  Farnaz  Malik,  Chief  National  Institute  of  Health  Drugs 

Control and Traditional Medicines Division was on long leave till 08.06.2009, 

so  how  she  had  signed  the  reports  on  30.05.2009  and  under  what 

authority?  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  by  referring  Section  16  of  the 

Drugs  Act,  1976  argued  that  Government  Analysis  CDL  Karachi  and  Chief 

NIH  Dr.  Farnaz  Malik  are  not  legally  authorized  to  perform  the  test  of  the 

petitioner’s  product  (Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg)  being  not  appointed  as 

Government  Analyst.  Carrying  the  same  notion,  the  learned  counsel  for 

petitioner  further  raised  a  question  that  competent  committee  for  test 

purposes  had  chosen  random  samples  from  different  76  Batches  of 

Paracetamol Tablet 500mg that were delivered to Central Drugs Laboratory 

Karachi  and  found  it  of  standard  quality,  so  how  the  committee  after 

conducting 

re-sampling/re-testing 

found 

the  same  product  as  of 

sub-standard  quality?  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  further  argued  that  if 

the same product proved to be of a  sub-standard  quality,  the same might 

be  due  to  maltreatment  of  the  product  on  the  part  of  respondents  or 

respondent  No.4  in  connivance  with  rivals  of  petitioner  who  are  trying  to 

cause irreparable loss to the petitioner.  

11. 

Learned counsel for petitioner while concluding his arguments stated 

that  acts  of  the  respondents  for  taking  samples  under  the  control  of 

respondent  No.4  or  his  superiors,  test  reports  for  CDL  Karachi  and  show 

cause notices etc. are unlawful and without lawful authority. 

12.  On 

the  other  hand, 

the 

learned  counsel 

for  petitioner, 

in 

WP  No.267/2010,  while  endorsing  aforesaid  arguments  evoked  the  interim 

order  dated  24.06.2009  passed  by  this  Court  in  the  instant  case  and  stated 

that the respondents being aware of the restraining order conducted random 

test/re-test,  issued  show  cause  notice  dated  05.11.2009  and  cancelled  the 

drug  manufacturing  license  (Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg),  respondents  No.2 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [6] 

and 3 had violated orders of the Court and therefore the actions taken by the 

respondents are illegal, perverse, void ab initio and of no legal effect. 

13. 

Conversely the learned AAG as well as Drugs Inspector contend that 

petitioner  is  not  entitled  for  any  equitable  relief  as  alternate  remedy  is 

available  against  the  final  order  of  cancellation  of  Paracetamol  Tablet 

500mg.  They  further  contend  that  petitioner  has  not  filed  WP  No.2303/09 

against any final order, therefore, writ petition is not maintainable and final 

order 

impugned 

in  WP  No.267/10  can  be  assailed  before 

the 

hierarchy/authority  provided  under  Drugs  Act  1976,  therefore,  the  second 

writ petition is also not competent.  

14. 

Arguments heard, record perused.  

15. 

From  the  perusal  of  record  it  has  been  observed  that  petitioner 

Shifa  Laboratory  Pvt  Ltd.  deals  with  manufacturing  and  sales  of 

medicines/pharma  products  for  the  last  50  years  through  a  valid  license 

issued under Drugs Act, 1976. The petitioner had participated in the tender 

for  supply  of  Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  and  being  a  successful  bidder, 

received pre-award notification for supply of Paracetamol  Tablet 500mg to 

National  Programme  for  Family  Planning  and  Primary  Healthcare  and 

Reproductive Health Project, Ministry of Health for year 2007/08 vide letter 

dated 17.12.2007 issued by National Coordinator of National Programme for 

Family Planning and Primary Healthcare, Islamabad respondent No. 3.  

16. 

The contract was executed on 07.07.2008 for supply of Paracetamol 

Tablet  500mg  @47.37/pack, 

total  1,522,890  packs  against 

total 

consideration  of  Rs.72,139,725.63/-,  whereby  purchase  order  on  behalf  of 

respondent  No.3  was  issued  on  07.07.2008  with  a  schedule  of  supply  of 

Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  with  a  condition  that  the  packing  shall  contain 

phrase  on  each  strip,  i.e.,  “NOT FOR SALE, FOR USE ONLY BY THE 

NATIONAL  PROGRAMME  FOR  FAMILY  PLANNING  AND  PRIMARY 

HEALTHCARE”.  

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [7] 

17. 

As per terms and conditions of contract, random samples were to be 

taken  from  all  batches  for  the  purposes  of  test  analysis  by  Central  Drugs 

Laboratory  CDL  Karachi,  however,  after  few  samples  which  were  of 

standard  quality  it  was  observed  that  the  samples  taken  from  Hyderabad 

and  Peshawar  have  been  found  sub-standard  by  CDL  Karachi,  whereupon 

three (03) show cause notices were issued by respondent No.2, the Drugs 

Registration  Board,  Ministry  of  Health,  Government  of  Pakistan,  Islamabad 

on  the  basis  of  test  analysis  certificate  dated  30.05.2009  wherein  it  was 

observed that  the samples do not comply with B.P. 2007 and the  samples 

have  been  found  of  sub-standard  quality  on  the  basis  of  test  performed 

whereupon  show  cause  notices  dated  04.06.2009  were  issued  and  the 

petitioner  was  directed  to  appear  before  the  219th  Meeting  held  on 

08.06.2009  in  C-Block  Pak  Secretariat,  Islamabad  before  the  Drugs 

Registration  Board.  The  petitioner  had  raised  certain  objections  in  the 

sampling of the said Paracetamol Tablet 500mg. But there is no final order 

in the field nor even referred in WP No.2303/09 whereby the petitioner has 

assailed the Test Reports No.82 to 84/2009 dated 27.04.2009, Test Reports 

No.FP-05  to  12/2009  dated  04.05.2009,  Test  Reports  FP-24  to  41/2009 

dated 15.05.2009 and Test Reports No.31 to 13-M/2009 dated 30.05.2009. 

However,  when  petitioner  did  not  participate  in  the  proceedings,  the 

respondents had finally passed an order dated 06.11.2009 of Cancellation of 

Registration  of  Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  which  was  communicated 

through  letter  dated  25.11.2009  by  the  Drugs  Registration  Board,  Ministry 

of Health, Government of Pakistan.  

18. 

The petitioner assailed the cancellation of registration of Paracetamol 

Tablet 500mg in second WP No.267/10 on the ground that the High Court 

has  already  passed  restraining  order  vide  order  dated  24.06.2009  but  the 

respondents  have  cancelled  the  registration  of  the  product  in  violation  of 

restraining order.  

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [8] 

19. 

I  have  gone  through  every  document  on  record  and  it  has  been 

observed  that  the  petitioner  has  assailed  the  test  results  of  Paracetamol 

Tablet  500mg  whereas  through  the  certificate  of  test  analysis  by  Central 

Drugs  Laboratory,  it  has  been  declared  that  the  samples  are  of 

sub-standard quality as they do not comply with the determined quantity of 

the product in the tablet as required under the quality control.  The samples 

taken by Federal Inspector of Drugs Hyderabad and Peshawar were further 

sent  for  test  to  the  Drugs  Control  and  Traditional  Medicines  Division, 

National  Institute  of  Health,  Islamabad.  However,  Drugs  and  Traditional 

Medicines  Division,  NIH  confirmed  that  the  samples  do  not  contain  the 

required  percentage  substances  in  each  tablet  and  the  samples  are  of 

sub-standard  quality.  On  the  basis  of  said  results,  different  show  cause 

notices  have  been  issued  initially  on  04.06.2009  whereas  the  proceedings 

were  under  process  but  the  petitioner  filed  WP  No.2303/09  while 

challenging  the  results  of  Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  issued  by  Central 

Drugs Laboratory, Karachi.  

20. 

In  the  second  writ  petition  the  petitioner  assailed  the  final  order  of 

cancellation  of  registration  of  Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg  vide  registration 

No.010449 dated 25.11.2009.  

21. 

It is a settled law that show cause notice cannot be considered as a 

final result to settle any issue rather it is an opportunity to the individual to 

reply  the  same  and  justify  his  stance  in  order  to  clear  himself  from  the 

allegations referred in the show cause notice. However, in present case the 

petitioner  has  not  replied  the  show  cause  notice  rather  adopted  the 

approach  to  delay  the  proceedings  on  the  basis  of  lame  excuses. 

Even  otherwise,  the  petitioner  has  been  granted  with  sufficient  time  to 

appear  before  the  Drugs  Registration  Board  in  219th  Meeting  held  on 

08.06.2009  at  Islamabad  through  a  show  cause  notice  dated  04.06.2009 

but petitioner did not adopt the due course and failed to appear before the 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [9] 

Board, however the proceedings remained pending and finally the petitioner 

was  called  to  appear  before  the  Drugs  Registration  Board  in  its 

221st  meeting  held  on  06.11.2009  in  the  Committee  Room,  Block-C,  Pak 

Secretariat,  Ministry  of  Health,  Islamabad  but  the  petitioner  through  his 

letter  dated  05.11.2009  never  opted  to  appear  before  the  Board  rather 

mentioned  in  their  reply  that  matter  is  subjudice  before  the  High  Court, 

therefore,  the  Drugs  Registration  Board  has  issued  the  Cancellation  of  the 

Registration  of  the  Product  (Paracetamol  Tablet  500mg)  registration 

No.010449  vide  letter  dated  25.11.2009.  In  such  like  eventuality,  when 

proceedings  have  not  been  concluded  and  show  cause  notice  is  pending, 

constitutional  remedy  could  not  be  invoked,  reliance  is  placed  upon 2011 

PLC(CS) 914 Lahore (Zulfiqar Cheema v/s Technical Education 

and Vocational Training Authority) wherein it is held that:- 

11.  There  is  another  aspect  of  the  matter.  Issuance  of 
show-cause notice does not mean that the case will invariably be 
decided against the petitioner and there is always a possibility 
that the same may be decided in favour of the petitioner. Laying 
challenge to a show-cause-notice is, therefore, no different that 
filing a petition on the basis of an apprehension or a speculation. 
Such a petition is premature and not ripe for adjudication. "Just 
as a case can be brought too late; ... it can be brought too early, 
and not yet be ripe for adjudication ... until the controversy has 
become concrete and focused, it is difficult for the Court to 
evaluate the practical merits of the position of each party." The 
basic rational behind the ripeness doctrine is "to prevent the 
courts  through  avoidance  of  premature  adjudication,  from 
entangling  themselves  in  abstract  disagreements  over 
administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from 
judicial interference until an administrative decision has been 
formalized  and  its  effects  felt  in  a  concrete  way  by  the 
challenging parties. 

Similar  view  has  also  been  taken  by  Division  Bench  of  Lahore  High 

Court  in  2011 PLC (CS) 1551 (Abdul Raheem Khan v/s MD 

PEPCO, WAPDA House Lahore) holding therein that:- 

“This Court in Muhammad Akhtar Sherani and 35 others v. The  
Punjab Textbook Board, Lahore and 4 others 2001 PLC (C.S.) 
939 has held that a petition under Article 199 of the Constitution 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [10] 

of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 would not be maintainable 
against mere issuance of a show cause notice since the appellant 
has been simply called upon to show cause as to why he should 
not  be  proceeded  against.  The  august  Supreme  Court  of 
Pakistan  in  Virasat  Ullah  v.  Bashir  Ahmad,  Settlement 
Commissioner (Industries) and another (1969 SCMR 154) has 
also held that mere issuance of a notice by the settlement 
Commissioner calling upon the transferee to justify his transfer 
could not furnish the basis for filing a constitutional petition.” 

22. 

The  basic  stance  taken  by  the  petitioner  in  WP  No.2303/09  is  that 

the  proceedings  were  already  pending  before  the  High  Court  and  a 

restraining order was well in field. 

23. 

But despite that respondents cancelled their registration. I have gone 

through the restraining order dated 24.06.2009 passed in CM No.2804/09 in 

WP  2303/09  (old  number  WP  1114/09),  and  reached  to  a  conclusion  that 

this  Court  passed  the  restraining  order  only  “till next date of hearing” 

whereas on the next date of hearing i.e., 02.07.2009 the restraining order 

was not extended and thereafter instant case got fixed before this Court on 

17.01.2017  for  the  first  time.  Similarly,  the  record  of  the  second 

WP  No.267/10  which  was  initially  filed  before  the  Lahore  High  Court, 

Rawalpindi  Bench,  Rawalpindi,  clearly  demonstrates  that  the  final  order 

dated  06.11.2009  communicated  vide 

letter  dated  25.11.2009  was 

suspended  vide  order  dated  25.01.2010  and  the  same  was  in  field  till 

13.05.2010  and  thereafter  the  second  writ  petition  has  also  been  fixed 

before this Court for the first time on 17.01.2017 after the elapse of almost 

seven and a half years.  

24. 

From  the  perusal  of  record  it  has  been  observed  that  show  cause 

notice has not been settled till date even otherwise it is settled proposition 

of  law  that  status  of  show  cause  notice  is  not  conclusive  as  nothing  has 

been  finalized  till  date  in  WP  No.2303/09,  the  petitioner  has  assailed  the 

test reports in the said writ petition which could be assailed as per remedy 

available  under  the  law  whereas  Sec.7  of  Drugs  Acts,  1976  provides  the 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [11] 

registration of drugs whereas Federal Government has setup a registration 

board for the said purposes. Sec.22(4) of the Drugs Act, 1976 provides the 

mechanism for test and analysis by the Government Analyst regarding any 

sample of drug which has been delivered to the Government Analyst by the 

Inspector.  Adding  more,  the  concept  of  appellate  board  is  also  available 

under the said law, however any person aggrieved with any order of central 

licensing  board  or  the  registration  board  or  the  licensing  authority,  can 

assail  the  said  order  before  the  appellate  board  and  even  otherwise  the 

appellate  board  can  entertain  the  revision  of  any  said  decision  on  its  own 

motion,    similarly  Sec.9(a)  provides  appeal  to  appellate  authority,  hence  it 

can  safely  be  concluded  that  alternate  remedies  are  in  field  but  the 

petitioner  has  not  availed  any  such  remedy  and  directly  approached  this 

Court  without  availing  statutory  remedies.  In  such  eventuality  writ  petition 

is not competent, reliance is placed upon 2001 SCMR 1493 (Mst. Kaniz 

Fatima VS Muhammad Salim) wherein it has been held that:- 

“By now it is well-settled that “where a particular statute 
provides a self-contained machinery for the determination 
of questions arising under the Act as and where law 
provides  a  remedy  by  appeal  or  revision  to  another 
Tribunal fully competent to give any relief, any indulgence 
to the contrary by the High Court is bound to produce a 
sense of distrust in statutory Tribunals. Where, therefore,  
a petitioner without exhausting his remedy provided by 
the statute under which h complained had files a writ 
petition,  it  was  held  that  the  application  in  the 
circumstances would not lie.” 

25. 

Similarly,  petitioner  has  raised  question  of  disputed  facts.  Firstly, 

when  petitioner  contends  that  Federal  Inspector  Drugs,  Peshawar  has 

issued  a 

letter/corrigendum  regarding  correction  of  batch  number 

mentioned  on  the  test  reports,  secondly,  the  petitioner  has  referred  in  his 

petition  and  offered  for  re-sampling  of  drugs  as  petitioner  did  not  accept 

the results and thirdly, the petitioner has claimed that full protocols of the 

test applied have not been provided. The above referred position of record 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 2303/09 and W.P. No.267/10  

         [12] 

clearly  demonstrates  that  the  disputed  question  of  facts  have  been  raised 

which could not be adjudicated upon in the constitutional petition, reliance 

is  placed  upon PLD 2001 SC 415 (Secretary to the Government of 

Punjab, Forest Department, Punjab VS Ghulam Nabi, etc.) wherein 

it is held that:- 

 “It hardly needs any elaboration that “the superior Courts 
should not involve themselves into investigations of disputed 
question of fact which necessitate taking of evidence. This 
can  more  appropriately  be  done  in  the  ordinary  Civil 
Procedure  for  litigation  by  a  suit.  This  extraordinary 
jurisdiction is intended primarily, for providing an expeditious 
remedy in a case where the illegibility of the impugned 
action of an executive or other authority can be established 
without any elaborate enquiry into complicated or disputed 
facts.” 

26. 

The net result which flows from above discussion is that:- 

(i) 

In  W.P.  No.2303/09,  as  disputed  questions  of  facts  are 

involved,  which  cannot  be  decided  without  recording  of 

evidence, therefore, instant writ petition stands dismissed.  

(ii) 

As  far  as  W.P.  No.267/10  is  concerned,  in  view  of  above 

discussion  the  petitioner  has  alternate  remedy  available  to 

them  under  the  law,  therefore,  said  writ  petition  is  not 

maintainable, resultantly, the same stands dismissed.
