       Gujjar, Advocates  

Respondents by:        Mr.  Arshid  Mehmood  Kiani,  learned  Deputy

__________________________________________________________________________ 

MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  this  judgment,  I 

propose  to  decide  writ  petitions  No.3503/2019,  1700/2019  and 

3143/2018 since they entail common questions of law and fact.  

2. 

Through  writ  petition  No.3503/2019,  the  petitioner,  Mst.  Saman 

Naz,  impugns  the  notification  dated  26.09.2019  issued  by  the  Federal 

Directorate  of  Education,  Islamabad  (“F.D.E.”),  whereby  she  was 

repatriated  to  her  parent  department,  i.e.  Workers  Welfare  Board, 

Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (“K.P.K”).  

3. 

Through  writ  petition  No.3143/2018,  the  petitioner,  Ms.  Faheem 

Begum,  impugns  the  order  dated  27.07.2018  issued  by  the  F.D.E., 

whereby she was repatriated to her parent department, i.e. Elementary 

and Secondary Education Department, Government of K.P.K. 

4. 

Through  writ  petition  No.1700/2019,  the  petitioner,  Ms.  Naveeda 

Ejaz, seeks a direction to the F.D.E. to issue her absorption order with 

effect from March 2013 on the basis of the decision taken by the Prime 

Minister  to  absorb  deputationists  serving  in  the  F.D.E.  under  the 

wedlock  policy.  Furthermore,  the  petitioner  seeks  the  benefit  of 

upgradation to BS-16 with effect from 01.07.2016.  

5.  Messrs  Muhammad  Asif  Gujjar  and  Kashif  Ali  Malik,  Advocates, 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  submitted  that  the  petitioners’ 

husbands  were  gainfully  employed  in  Islamabad;  that  the  petitioners 

have  a  right  to  serve  as  a  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  until  their 

husbands are serving in Islamabad; that the petitioners’ repatriation to 

their  parent  departments  would  be  most  inconvenient  for  them  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,

their  families;  that  presently  there  are  44  deputationists  in  BS-16 

serving  in  the  F.D.E.;  that  the  respondents  have  adopted  a  policy  of 

pick  and  choose  based  on  favourtism  in  issuing  repatriation  orders; 

and that under the Establishment Division’s Office Memorandum dated 

13.05.1998, the petitioners should be permitted to continue working on 

deputation basis at the F.D.E.  

6. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  further  submitted  that  the 

petitioners should be given the benefit of permanent absorption in the 

borrowing  department/F.D.E.  under  the  wedlock  policy;  that  letter 

dated  11.11.2014  from  the  Capital  Administration  and  Development 

Division (“C.A.&D.D.”) shows that the Prime Minister had approved the 

absorption  of  11  female  teachers  (including  the  petitioners  in  writ 

petitions No.1700/2019 and 3143/2018) serving as deputationists in the 

said  Division;  that  on  24.03.2012,  the  Prime  Minister  had  approved 

amendment in Rule 20A of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion 

and  Transfer)  Rules,  1973  (“the  1973  Rules”)  so  that  the  serving 

husbands  and  wives  are  posted  at  the  same  station;  that  thereafter  a 

proviso  was  inserted  to  Rule  20A  of  the  said  Rules;  and  that  after  the 

insertion  of  the  said  proviso,  the  maximum  deputation  period  of  five 

years does not apply to a husband and wife posted at the same station. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be 

allowed in terms of the relief sought therein. 

7. 

On  the  other  hand,  the 

learned  Deputy  Attorney-General 

submitted  that  the  petitioners  had  served  as  deputationists  in  the 

F.D.E. 

for  more  than 

five  years;  that  the  petitioners’  parent 

departments  has  not  issued  No  Objection  Certificate  (“N.O.C.”)  for  a 

further  extension 

in  the  petitioners’  deputation  period;  that  a 

deputationist  has  no  vested  right  to  be  absorbed  in  the  borrowing 

department  without  the  concurrence  of  the  parent  department;  and 

that  at  no  material  stage  has  the  petitioners’  parent  departments 

issued  N.O.C.  for  the  petitioners’  permanent  absorption  in  F.D.E. 

Learned  Deputy  Attorney-General  prayed  for  the  writ  petitions  to  be 

dismissed.  

8. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  as  well  as  the  learned  Deputy  Attorney-General  and  have 

perused the record with their able assistance.

WRIT  PETITION  NO.3503/2019  (MST.  SAMAN  NAZ  VS  FEDERATION 
OF PAKISTAN, ETC.):- 

9. 

The  record  shows  that the  petitioner  was  appointed  on  contract 

basis as a Teacher in Folks Grammar Higher Secondary School, Hattar 

(Female),  District  Haripur,  K.P.K.  under  the  Workers  Welfare  Board, 

Government  of  K.P.K.  Vide  notification  dated  08.02.2011,  the  K.P.K. 

Workers  Welfare  Board  regularized  her  services.  Vide  office  order 

dated 19.09.2013, the petitioner was promoted from BS-14 to BS-16.  

10.  Since  the  petitioner’s  father  was  serving  as  an  Assistant 

Incharge  (BS-15)  in  the  C.A.&D.D.  and  her  husband  was  working  for 

Wi-tribe  Pakistan  Limited  at  Islamabad,  the  petitioner,  on  30.05.2012, 

applied  to  be  sent  on  deputation  to  the  F.D.E.  On  30.04.2014,  the 

petitioner  was  released  from  duties  at  the  Folks  Grammar  Higher 

Secondary  School  so  that  she  could  join  her  duties  as  a  deputationist 

at the F.D.E.  

11.  Vide  office  order  dated  05.05.2014  issued  by  the  F.D.E.,  the 

petitioner  was  taken  on  deputation  for  a  period  of  one  year  (i.e. 

30.04.2014  to  29.04.2015)  and  posted  in  the  Islamabad  Model  School, 

F-7/2,  Islamabad.  Vide  letter  dated  15.05.2015,  an  extension  for  a 

period  of  two  years  (i.e.  from  30.04.2015  to  29.04.2017)  in  the 

petitioner’s deputation period was approved by the Sectary, C.A.&D.D. 

Vide notification dated 21.05.2015 issued by the F.D.E., the petitioner’s 

deputation  period  was  further  extended  for  a  period  of  two  years  (i.e. 

30.04.2015 to 29.04.2017). Vide notification dated 19.04.2017 issued by 

the  C.A.&D.D.,  the  petitioner’s  deputation  period  was  extended  under

12.  Vide  letter  dated  14.05.2019,  the  F.D.E.  requested  the  Workers 

Welfare Board, Government of K.P.K. for the issuance of N.O.C. so that 

the  petitioner’s  deputation  period  is  extended  to  29.04.2020.  There  is 

nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that  the  Workers  Welfare  Board, 

Government  of  K.P.K.  had  issued  N.O.C.  for  an  extension  in  the 

petitioner’s  deputation  period  beyond  five  years.  Vide  impugned 

notification  dated  26.09.2019  issued  by  the  F.D.E.,  the  petitioner  has 

been repatriated to her parent department.

WRIT PETITION NO. 3143/2018 (FAHEEM BEGUM VS FEDERATION OF 
PAKISTAN, ETC.):- 
13.  The  record  shows  that  in  2008,  the  petitioner  was  serving  as  a 

teacher  in  Government  Girls  Primary  School,  Ghareeb  Abad,  Takht 

Bhai, District Mardan. The petitioner’s husband is serving as a Trained 

Graduate  Teacher  at  the  Islamabad  Model  College  for  Boys,  I-10/1, 

Islamabad.  The  petitioner  had  applied  to  be  sent  on  deputation  to  the 

F.D.E.  Vide  letter  dated  19.11.2008,  the  F.D.E.  requested  the  School 

and Literacy Department, Government of K.P.K. to send the petitioner 

on  deputation  to  the  F.D.E.  for  the  period  of  three  years.  Vide  letter 

dated  14.02.2009, 

the  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education 

Department,  Government  of  K.P.K.  placed  the  petitioner’s  services  at 

the  disposal  of  the  F.D.E.  on  deputation  basis  for  an  initial  period  of 

three  years.  Vide  office  order  dated  14.03.2009,  the  petitioner  was 

posted/transferred  to  the  Federal  Government  Junior  Model  School 

No.40,  I-10/1,  Islamabad.  There  is  nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that 

the petitioner’s deputation period was extended.  

14.  On  03.04.2018,  the  F.D.E.  requested  the  Elementary  and 

Secondary  Education  Department,  Government  of  K.P.K.  for  an 

extension 

in  the  petitioner’s  deputation  period  with  effect  from 

17.02.2014.  Vide 

letter  dated  06.07.2018, 

the  Elementary  and 

Secondary  Education  Department,  Government  of  K.P.K.  regretted 

F.D.E.’s request for an extension in the petitioner’s deputation period. 

In the said letter dated 06.07.2018, the petitioner’s parent department 

had  noted  that  if  the  petitioner’s  fails  to  join  her  duty  in  the  parent 

department,  she  shall  be  proceeded  against  on  account  of 

unauthorized  stay/misused  of  deputation  period  beyond  15.02.2012. 

Furthermore,  the  petitioner’s  parent  department  requested  the  F.D.E. 

to relieve her immediately so that she could report back to her parent 

department.  Consequently,  vide  office  order  dated  27.07.2018,  the 

petitioner  was  repatriated  to  her  parent  department.  The  said  office 

order  has  been  assailed  by  the  petitioner  in  the  instant  writ  petition. 

The  petitioner  also  asserts  that  the  Prime  Minister  had  approved  the 

petitioner’s absorption in F.D.E. as reflected in letter dated 11.11.2014 

issued by the C.A.&D.D.

WRIT  PETITION  NO.1700/2019  (NAVEEDA  EJAZ  VS  FEDERATION  OF 
PAKISTAN, ETC.):- 
15.  The  record  shows  that in  2008,  the  petitioner was  serving  in  the 

Government Girls High School, Rustom, Mardan, K.P.K. On 13.11.2008, 

the petitioner was sent on deputation to the F.D.E. for a period of three 

years,  i.e.  up  to  12.11.2011.  Office  order  dated  01.12.2008  issued  by 

the  F.D.E.  clearly  provides  that  on  the  expiry  of  the  petitioner’s 

deputation  period,  “she will automatically stand repatriated to her 

parent department.” The  petitioner’s  husband  is  living  in  Islamabad 

and  is  presently  serving  as  Upper  Division  Clerk  at  Islamabad  Model 

College for Girls, G-7/2, Islamabad. 

16.  Written  comments  filed  on  behalf  of  the  F.D.E.  shows  that  the 

petitioner’s  deputation  period  was  extended  up  to  11.11.2013.  She 

completed  her  five-year  deputation  period  on  12.09.2013.  It  has  also 

been  pleaded  that  the  petitioner’s  parent  department  regretted  the 

issuance  of  N.O.C.  for  further  extension  in  the  petitioner’s  deputation 

period,  and  had  requested  for  her  to  be  repatriated.  The  said  written 

comments  also  show  that  the  petitioner  has  been  repatriated  with 

effect from 03.05.2019.  

17.  On 29.04.2019, the petitioner filed the instant writ petition. Along 

with  the  said  petition,  the  petitioner  filed  an  application  for  interim 

injunction praying for the respondents to be restrained from passing an 

adverse  order  against  her.  Vide  interim  order  dated  30.04.2019,  this 

Court restrained the respondents from repatriating the petitioner.  

WHETHER  A  DEPUTATIONIST  HAS  A  VESTED  RIGHT  TO  COMPLETE 
THE DEPUTATION PERIOD:-  

18. 

It is settled law that a deputationist may not necessarily complete 

the tenure  for which he  was  sent on deputation and  the power  vested 

with  the  competent  authority  to  repatriate  a  deputationist  without 

assigning any reason. In case of transfer on deputation, no vested right 

accrued to a deputationist to continue for the period of deputation. The 

competent  authority  was  empowered  to  repatriate  a  deputationist  as 

and  when  the  exigencies  of  service  required.  Some  of  the  cases  in 

which this view has been taken are mentioned herein below:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Pakistan  VS  Fazal  Rehman  Khundkar  (PLD  1959 

Supreme  Court  (Pak.)  82),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  it  is  a  matter  of  practice  and 

 
 
6 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

common  experience,  that  officers  of  the  Provincial  cadres 

deputed for service at the Centre are frequently recalled by their 

Province,  by  the Provincial  Government,  in  the  exigencies  of the 

public  service.  Against  such  a  recall  they  have  no  right  of  any 

kind  to  object  being  substantively  officers  of  the  Provincial 

Government and only on deputation to the Centre. The mere fact 

that they may be holding at the Centre a post higher in rank than 

that  to  which  their  place  in  the  Provincial  cadre  entitles  them  in 

the  Provincial  service  does  not  constitute  the  least  bar  to  the 

making  of  an order  by  the Central Government  at  the  request of 

the  Provincial  Government,  re-placing  the  services  of  such  an 

officer at the disposal of his parent Government. 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Dr.  Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  VS  CDA,  Islamabad 

(2010 SCMR 378), it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

of Pakistan that the provisions of the 1973 Rules, and rules made 

thereunder as well as Esta Code were silent about the fact that a 

deputationist must serve his entire period of deputation and such 

omission seemed  deliberate enabling the competent authority to 

utilize service of an employee in the manner as  it  might  deem  fit 

and proper. Period of deputation could at the best be equated to 

that of an expression of maximum period which could be curtailed 

or extended by competent authority and no legal or vested rights 

were  available  to  a  deputationist  to  serve  his  entire  period  of 

deputation in borrowing department. 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Mst.  Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan 

(2013 PLC  (C.S.)  915),  it  has  been  held  by  this  Court  that  a 

deputationist  cannot  remain  on  deputation  for  an  indefinite 

period or stipulated period in accordance with his/her own whims 

and  wishes.  Civil  servant  has  no  vested  right  to  complete  the 

deputation  period  as  it  is  a  matter  relating  to  the  terms  and 

conditions  of  service.  Competent  authority  of  borrowing 

department having sole discretion to decide fate of deputationist 

could repatriate him at any time to parent department.  

(iv) 

In  case  of  Abdul  Majeed  VS  Chief  Secretary,  Punjab  (2015 PLC 

(C.S.) 1381),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

that a deputationist did not have any vested right to remain on the 

7 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

post  as  deputationist  forever  or  for  a  stipulated  period.  A 

deputationist  could  be  ordered  to  be  repatriated  to  his  parent 

department  at  any  time  without  assigning  any  reason.  Parent 

department  of  appellant-employee  was  not  bound  to  assign 

reason for his repatriation. 

(v) 

In  case  of  Lal  Khan  VS  Employees  Old  Age  Benefit  Institution 

(2010 PLC  (C.S.) 1377),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court of Sindh that a deputationist had no vested right to remain 

on  post  forever  or  for  a  stipulated  period.  A  deputationist  could 

not challenge order of his repatriation as he could be repatriated 

to parent department at any time. 

19.  On  account  of  the  above  referred  trite  law,  the  petitioner  could 

not  have  any  grievance  against  her  repatriation  by  the  borrowing 

department  to  her  parent  department.  Another  vital  question  that 

needs  to  be  answered  is  whether  the  petitioners  could  have  invoked 

the Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court to prevent their repatriation 

to their parent department. The law in this regard is also well settled. In 

the case of Dr. Shafi-ur-Rehman Afridi VS CDA, Islamabad (2010 SCMR 

378), it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan that a 

deputationist  cannot  be  treated  as  an  'aggrieved  person'  because 

he/she has no vested right to remain on a post as deputationist forever 

or  for  a  stipulated  period  as  mentioned  in  notification  and  can  be 

repatriated at any time. At no material stage,  had the petitioners been 

absorbed in the borrowing department.  

WHETHER  A  DEPUTATIONIST  HAS  A  VESTED  RIGHT  TO  CONTINUE 
SERVING  AS  SUCH  UNTIL  HIS/HER  SPOUSE  IS  EMPLOYED  AT  THE 
STATION WHERE THE BORROWING DEPARTMENT IS LOCATED:- 

20.  Another  question  that  needs  to  be  determined  is  whether  a 

person posted on deputation at a particular station can claim to remain 

so  posted  for  all  the  period  during  which  his  or  her  spouse  remains 

employed at such a station. It is indeed not pleasant for a husband and 

wife  to  be  working  at  different  stations  but  the  law  cannot  be 

circumvented  to  bring  them  to  the  same  station.  To  hold  in  favour  of 

such  a  deputationist  would  be  tantamount  to  disregarding  the 

innumerable authorities from the Superior Courts holding that no legal 

or  vested  rights  were  available  to  a  deputationist  to  serve  as  in  the 

borrowing  department  for  an  indefinite  period.  In  the  case  of  Mst. 

 
8 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan,  (2013  PLC  (CS)  915),  the 

petitioner had challenged the repatriation to the parent department on 

the  ground  that  it  was  contrary  to  inter alia  the  wedlock  policy.  The 

petitioner in that case had also prayed for a direction to the borrowing 

department  to  absorb  her.  This  Court  dismissed  the  writ  petition  by 

inter alia holding that the petitioner's claim on the basis of the wedlock 

policy was not justifiable. Furthermore, it was held as follows:- 

"10.  The law on the subject is very much clear. The petitioner is a civil 
servant and remained on deputation for a fixed term and was returned 
to her parent department in consequence of terms and conditions of 
her deputation. A deputationist cannot remain on deputation for an 
indefinite period or stipulated period in accordance with his/her own 
whims and wishes. While taking this view, I am fortified by a judgment 
rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Dr. Shafi-ur-Rehman 
Afridi v. CDA Islamabad through Chairman and others (2010 SCMR 
378)." 

21.  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  Asma  Shaheen  VS  Federation  of 

Pakistan  (2013  PLC  (C.S.)  391,  this  Court  spurned  the  plea  that  a 

deputationist  cannot  be  repatriated  due  to  the  wedlock  policy.  At 

paragraph 13 of the said judgment, it has been held as follows:- 

“13.       From the plain reading of above said wedlock policy, it is 
obvious that the word "may" has been used in the said letters and 
not "shall". It has never been stressed that all the deputationists 
whose spouses are working at Islamabad shall must be absorbed or 
will continue to serve at Islamabad. As regards the contention that 
some of deputationists have been absorbed, the same cannot be 
taken into consideration, for the simple reason that it was the 
discretion  of  the  competent  authority  to  absorb  some  of 
deputationists  according  to  requirement  of  department, 
capabilities,  know  how,  performance,  qualification,  general 
reputation and on the basis of annual confidential reports. The 
others cannot claim the same treatment as of right. The deputation 
is a contract and if borrowing department does not need the 
services of a deputationist, he or she must go back to parent 
department and thus no fundamental rights of the petitioners have 
been infringed and no provisions of Constitution have been violated. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  have  failed  to  rebut  the 
contention of learned Deputy Attorney-General that at present no 
deputationist is being absorbed. There appears no political element 
with  regard  to  repatriation  of  the  petitioners  to  their  parent 
departments.” 

22.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  that  by  virtue  of  the proviso  of  Rule  20A  to  the  1973  Rules, 

the petitioner is entitled to continue serving as a deputationist until her 

husband  is  gainfully  employed  in  Islamabad,  it  may  be  noted  that  the 

said proviso  exempts  the  application  of  Rule  20A  of  the  said  Rules  to 

 
 
9 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

posting  of  (i)  serving  husband  and  wife  at  the  same  station,  (ii) 

unmarried  female  government  servants  at  the  place  of  residence  of 

their  parents/family,  and  (iii)  married  female  government  servants  at 

the  place  of  residence/posting  of  their  husbands  who  are  not  in 

government  employment.  Rule  20A  of  the  said  Rules  sets  out  the 

eligibility  for  appointment  on  deputation  and  the  maximum  period  for 

which an appointment on deputation can be made. Therefore, by virtue 

of the said proviso, the maximum period for appointment on deputation 

may  not  apply  to  the  three  categories  of  persons  referred  to  in  the 

proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  1973  Rules.  The  said  proviso  cannot  be 

interpreted  to  provide  for  an  indefinite  period  for  an  appointment  on 

deputation. The said proviso cannot come to the aid of a deputationist 

where N.O.C. for an extension in the deputation period is not given by 

the parent department or where the borrowing department is unwilling 

to  extend  the  deputation  period.  It  is  an  admitted  position  that  in  the 

cases  at  hand,  the  petitioners’  parent  departments  have  not  issued 

N.O.C.  for  an  extension 

in  their  deputation  period.  By 

issuing 

reparation  orders,  the  F.D.E.  (borrowing  department)  has  expressed 

its unwillingness to extend the petitioners’ deputation period.  

WHETHER  THE  PETITIONERS  HAVE  A  VESTED  RIGHT  TO  BE 
ABSORBED IN THE F.D.E. (BORROWING DEPARTMENT):- 

23.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners that the petitioners have a right to be absorbed in the F.D.E. 

on  the  basis  of  the  Prime  Minister’s  decision  reflected 

in  the 

C.A.&D.D.’s  letter  dated  11.11.2014,  suffice  it  to  say  that  for  the 

absorption  or  confirmation  of  any  deputationist  in  the  borrowing 

department,  the  ESTA  CODE  prescribes  a  procedure.  Till  date  formal 

orders 

for  the  petitioners’  absorption  have  not  been  passed. 

Establishment  Division’s  Office  Memorandum  No.1(28)/75-D.II,  dated 

06.03.1975,  provides  that  where  there  is  an  intention  to  permanently 

absorb a deputationist in the cadre or department where he is serving 

on deputation and the recruitment rules for the post provide for such a 

course, 

in  such  cases  the  consent  of  the  deputationist  to  the 

suspension  or  termination  of  lien  on  his  permanent  post  in  the  parent 

department, as well as the agreement of the parent department, should 

be obtained. With the completion of these formalities, the deputationist 

 
 
10 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

will  be  treated  as  a  regular  member  of  the  establishment  of  the 

borrowing department. As early as 1952, it was stated in the Ministry of 

Finance’s  letter  No.600-RIII/52,  dated  06.03.1952  that  permanent 

officers belonging to a Department or Government, while on deputation 

to another Department or Government, should not be confirmed in the 

latter  without  the  prior  formal  concurrence  of  the  former  and  the 

consent  of  the  officer  concerned.  This  instruction  has  been  formally 

recognized in Establishment Division’s Office Memorandum  No.8/7/64-

F.I,  dated  19.10.1964.  The  absorption  of  a  deputationist  made  in 

derogation of the said policy would be shorn of legality. 

24.  At  no  material  stage  has  the  petitioners’  borrowing  department 

sought  the  formal  concurrence  of  the  parent  departments  for  their 

absorption  during  the  permissible  deputation  period.  Since  the  very 

process  for  the  petitioners’  absorption  has  not  been  initiated  in 

accordance  with  the  applicable 

law,  the  petitioners’  desire  for 

absorption  in  the  borrowing  department  is  not  a  valid  ground  for 

assailing the repatriation order. In case of Senate Secretariat VS Faiqa 

Abdul  Hayee  (2014 SCMR 522),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan that absorption was not a vested right of an 

employee and the employer had the right and authority to terminate the 

deputation  period  or  repatriate  the  employee  back  to  his/her  parent 

department.  In  case  of  Mst.  Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan 

(2013 PLC  (CS)  915),  it  has  been  held  by  this  Court  that  a  deputation 

being  a  contract,  a  deputationist  would  have  no  vested  right  to 

remain/continue  on  deputation  or  his  permanent  absorption.  A 

deputation  is  an  administrative  agreement  between  borrowing  and 

lending  authorities  for  utilizing  the  services  of  an  employee  in  the 

public  interest  and  exigency  of  services  against  a  particular  post 

against  which  the  deputationists  cannot  claim  any  right  of  permanent 

absorption.  Additionally,  in  case  of  Rasheed  Tareen  VS  Chairman 

Works  Welfare  Board  (2012 PLC  (CS) 54),  it  has  been  held  by  the 

Hon'ble  Balochistan  High  Court 

that  a  deputationist 

through 

Constitutional  petition  could  not  claim  permanent  absorption 

in 

borrowing  department  as 

it  was  the  prerogative  of  borrowing 

department  to  determine  tenure  of  deputation  to  revert/return  a 

deputationist or to absorb a deputationist permanently. It was also held 

11 

W.P.Nos.3503/2019,  
1700/2019 & 3143/2018 

that  due  to  the  borrowing  department’s  refusal  for  the  petitioner's 

permanent  absorption,  the  petitioner  could  not  be  termed  as  an 

aggrieved person. 

25. 

In view of the above, I find the instant petitions to be without merit 

and the same are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs.  

26.  Before  parting  with  this  judgment,  it  may  be  observed  that  the 

F.D.E. must not discriminate while deciding to repatriate deputationists 

who  have  completed  the  permissible  deputation  period  or  whose 

parent  departments  have  not  given  N.O.C.  for  an  extension  in  their 

deputation  period.  Furthermore,  since  there  is  a  growing  propensity 

for  deputationists  from  Provinces  to  be  absorbed  in  the  borrowing 

departments at Islamabad, the absorption of such deputationists must 

be  made  through  a  competitive  process.  Instead  of  appointing 

deputationists against posts in the F.D.E., regular appointments ought 

to  be  made  against  the  posts  vacated  as  a  result  of  repatriation  of 

deputationists.  In  the  case  of  Sudhir  Ahmed  VS  Speaker  Balochistan 

Provincial  Assembly  (2017  SCMR  2051),  it  was  held  that  where  rules 

required  a  post  to  be  filled  by  initial  recruitment  or  promotion,  a 

deviation  from  the  legal  course  should  not  be  adopted  by  making 

appointment by absorption.
