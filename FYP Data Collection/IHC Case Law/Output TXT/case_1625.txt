MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI  J.  Through 

the 

instant  petition,  the  petitioner  has  prayed  for his  post 

arrest 

bail 

in  case  FIR  No.  54/2020, 

dated

P.S Khana,  Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts  referred  in  the  instant  FIR lodged on 

the  complaint  of  Syeda  Yasmeen  Asad/respondent 

No.2  are  that  she  is  lawful  owner  of  House  No.  6, 

Madina  Town,  Khanna  Oak,  Islamabad; 

that  due  to 

her  family issues,  she  has  to  go to  Peshawar  for one 

month,  when  she  came  back  to her  house,  she  tried  to 

open 

the  lock  of  the  main  gate,  but  same  were 

changed  and  house  did  not  open,  and 

in 

the 

meanwhile  Younis,  Maju  and  six  (06)  unknown 

persons  armed  with  pistols  came  on  the  spot  and 

extended  life threats  to  her  and  told  her  that  house 

has  been  taken  over by them.

Crl.  Misc.  No. 729/B/2020 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for the  petitioner  contends  that 

petitioner  is  innocent  and  has  falsely  been  implicated 

in  the  instant  case;  that  no recovery  has  been  effected 

from the  petitioner;  that  challan  has  been  submitted 

in  the  Court;  that  petitioner  has  not  been  nominated 

in  the  instant  F.l.R. 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for the  respondent 

No.2 as  well as  State  Counsel  contend  that  petitioner 

is  habitual  offender,  who  is  involved in  number  of 

cases  of  similar  nature  and  is  a  Member  of  Qabza 

Mafia  gang; 

that 

the  eye-witness  Waheed  has 

specifically  ascribed  the  role  of present  petitioner  in 

the  alleged 

incident, 

even  petitioner  has  been 

nominated  through  supplementary  statement  with  the 

specific role by the  complainant  herself. 

5.  Arguments  heard  and  record  perused. 

6. 

Perusal  of record  reveals  that  the  petitioner  has 

been  involved in  the  abovementioned  case  through 

supplementary  statement  on  the  next  day  of alleged 

incident  for  trespassing  and  criminal 

intimidation. 

The  complainant 

is  not  eye-witness  of  any  theft  or 

trespassing, 

rather  she  alleged  that  her  house  was 

illegally  taken  over  by  Vounas,  Maju  and  six  (06) 

unknown  persons.  However,  at 

this 

stage 

the 

Investigation  Officer has  confirmed  that  the  house  has 

already  been  taken  over  by  the  complainant  and 

accused  persons  are  not  in  possession  of the  subject 

property. 

7. 

Tentative  assessment  of  record  reflects 

that 

present  petitioner  is  not  nominated 

in  the  instant 

F.1.R, even  no  recovery  has  been  effected  from him. 

3 

Crl. Misc. No. 729/B/2020 

Investigation  Officer  has  already 

submitted 

the 

challan  in  the  Court  on  26.03.2020  and  petitioner  is 

behind  the  bars  since  17.03.2020.  As such  the  offence 

with  which  the  petitioner  has  been  charged  does  not 

fall  within 

the  prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497 

Cr.P.C,  even  otherwise,  while considering  the  role  of 

the  petitioner,  ground  of further  inquiry  is visible from 

the  record  in  favour  of present  petitioner.  In  such  like 

cases,  the  grant  of  bail  is  a  rule  and  refusal  is  an 

exception.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  PLD  1995  SC 34 

(Tariq  Bashir  and  5  others  VS  The  StateJ, PLD 

2017  SC  733  (Muhammad  Tanveer  VS The  State 

and  anotherJ. 

8. 

For what  has  been  discussed  above,  the  instant 

petition  is  allowed  and  the  petitioner  is  admitted  to 

post  arrest  bail  subject  to his  furnishing  of bail  bonds 

in  the  sum  of Rs.50,000/-  with  one  surety  in  the  like 

amount  to the  satisfaction  of learned  Trial  Court.
