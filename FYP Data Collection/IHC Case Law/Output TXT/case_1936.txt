Mr. Zahid Idrees Mufti, Advocate 
Syed Ishtiaq Haider, Advocate 

MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the 

instant appeal under Section 39 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 

("the 1940 Act"), the appellant, National Highway Authority, 

impugns  the  judgment  &  decree  dated  20.04.2015,  passed 

by  the  Court  of  learned  Civil  Judge  (West)  Islamabad, 

dismissing 

the  appellant's  Objection  Petition  under 

Sections  30  and  33  of  the  1940  Act  against  the  arbitration 

award dated 25.06.2007, and making the said award a rule 

of Court. 

2. 

The facts essential for the disposal of this appeal are 

that  on  06.04.1993,  the  appellant  and  the  respondent  (M/s 

China  Petroleum  Engineering  Corporation)  entered  into  a 

contract  for  the  construction  of  additional  carriageway 

(Chablat  -  Nowshera,  Section  N-5)  (“the  Contract”).  Under 

the  terms  of  the  said  contract,  M/s  A.A.  Associates, 

Planners  and  Consulting  Engineers  was  appointed  as  the 

Engineer  for  the  Project.  Under  the  terms  of  the  Contract, 

the  respondent  and  the  Engineer  worked  out  a  Job-Mix 

Formula  ("JMF").  The  contract  provided  for  the  use  of  an 

asphalt additive called Cellulose Fibers in the asphalt base 

course  mix.  Subsequently,  after  discussions  between  the 

appellant, the respondent and the Engineer, it was decided 

not to add Cellulose Fibers in the asphalt base course mix. 

Therefore,  the  JMF  jointly  worked  out  by  respondent  and 

the Engineer did not include the use of Cellulose Fibers.  

 3. 

Vide letter dated 11.06.2001, the appellant instructed 

its  officers  to  recover  an  amount  of  Rs.31.200  Million  from 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
2 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

the respondent for not using Cellulose Fibers in the asphalt 

base  course  mix  in  the  road  works.  Aggrieved  by  the  said 

instructions of the appellant, the respondent, in accordance 

with  clause  67  of  the  contract,  raised  this  dispute  with  the 

Engineer  vide  letters  dated  11.08.2001,  30.08.2001  and 

14.09.2001.  The  Engineer  vide  letter  dated  02.10.2001 

expressed  its  inability  to  give  a  decision  on  the  matter.  As 

the Engineer did not give any decision, the respondent, vide 

notice  dated  16.01.2002,  requested  the  appellant  to  have 

this matter resolved through arbitration in accordance with 

clause 67 of the Contract. The appellant was also requested 

to  concur  in  the  appointment  of  a  sole  arbitrator  for  this 

purpose.  At  this  stage,  it  is  pertinent  to  reproduce  herein 

below the said clause 67 of the contract:-  

"67.  Settlement of Disputes 

67.1  Engineer's Decision  

If a dispute of any kind whatsoever arises between 
the Employer and the Contractor in connection with, or 
arising out of the contract or the execution of the Works, 
whether during the execution of the Works or after their 
completion and whether before or after repudiation or 
other termination of the Contract, including any dispute as 
to any opinion, instruction, determination, certificate or 
valuation of the Engineer, the matter in dispute shall, in 
the first place, be referred in writing to the engineer, with 
a copy to the other party. Such reference shall state that it 
is made pursuant to this Clause. No later than the eighty-
fourth day after the day on which he received such 
reference the Engineer shall give notice of his decision to 
the Employer and the Contractor. Such decision shall 
state that it is made pursuant to this Clause. 

Unless the Contract has already been repudiated or 
terminated, the Contractor shall, in every case, continue 
to proceed with the Works with all due diligence and the 
Contractor and the Employer shall give effect forthwith to 
every such decision of the Engineer unless and until the 
same shall be revised, as hereinafter provided, in an 
amicable settlement or an arbitral award.  

If  either  the  Employer  or  the  Contractor  be 
dissatisfied with any decision of the Engineer or if the 
Engineer fails to give notice of his decision on or before 
the eighty-fourth day after the day on which he received 
the reference, then either the Employer or the Contractor 
may, on or before the seventieth day after the day on 
which he received notice of such decision, or on or before 
the seventieth day after the day on which the said period 
of 84 days expired, as the case may be, give notice to the 
other party, with a copy for information to the engineer, of 
his  intention  to  commence  arbitration,  as  hereinafter 
provided as to the matter in dispute. Such notice shall 
establish the entitlement of the party giving the same to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
3 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

commence arbitration, as hereinafter provided, as to such 
dispute and, subject to Sub-Clause 67.4, no arbitration in 
respect thereof may be commenced unless such notice is 
given. 

If the Engineer has given notice of his decision as to 
a matter in dispute to the Employer and the Contractor 
and no notification of intention to commence arbitration 
as to such dispute has been given by either the Employer 
or the Contractor on or before the seventieth day after the 
day on which the parties received notice as to such 
decision  from  the  Engineer,  the  said  decision  shall 
become final and binding upon the Employer and the 
Contractor.  

67.2. Amicable Settlement 
   Where notice of intention to commence arbitration 
as to a dispute has been given in accordance with Sub-
Clause 67.1, arbitration of such dispute shall not be 
commenced unless an attempt has first been made by the 
parties to settle such dispute amicably. Provided that, 
unless the parties otherwise agree, arbitration may be 
commenced on or after the fifth-sixth day after the day on 
which notice of intention to commence arbitration of such 
dispute  was  given,  whether  or  not  any  attempt  at 
amicable settlement thereof has been made. 

the decision if any, of the Engineer has not become 

67.3. Arbitration  
 Any dispute in respect of which:-  
 a) 
final and binding pursuant to Sub-Clause 67.1, and  
 b)  amicable settlement has not been reached within 
the period stated in Sub-Clause 67.2, and shall be finally 
settled, unless otherwise specified in the Contract, under 
the  Rules  of  Conciliation  and  Arbitration  of  the 
International Chamber of Commerce  by one or more 
arbitrators  appointed  under  such  Rules.  The  said 
arbitrator(s) shall have full power to open up, review and 
revise any decision, opinion, instruction, determination, 
certificate or valuation of the Engineer related to the 
dispute.  

Neither party shall be limited in the proceedings 
before such arbitrator(s) to the evidence or arguments 
put before the Engineer for the purpose of obtaining his 
said  decision  pursuant  to  Sub-Clause  67.1.  No  such 
decision shall disqualify the Engineer from being called as 
a witness and giving evidence before the arbitrator(s) on 
any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute.  

Arbitration may be commenced prior to or after 
completion of the works, provided that the obligations of 
the Employer, the Engineer and the Contractor shall not 
be altered by reason of the arbitration being conducted 
during the progress of the Works.  

 67.4  Failure to Comply with Engineer's Decision 
   Where neither the Employer nor the Contractor has 
given notice of intention to commence arbitration of a 
dispute within the period stated in Sub-Clause 67.1 and 
the related decision has become final and binding, either 
party may, if the other party fails to comply with such 
decision, and without prejudice to any other rights it may 
have, refer the failure to arbitration in accordance with 
Sub-Clause 67.3. The provisions of sub-Clauses 67.1 and 

 
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
4 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

67.2 shall not apply to any such reference." (emphasis 
added)  

4. 

These  were  the  circumstances  in  which  the 

respondent 

filed  W.P.No.2978/2001  before 

the 

Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench, 

against  the  appellant's  said  notice dated  11.06.2001. 

The  prayer-clause 

in 

the  said  writ  petition 

is 

reproduced herein below:- 

"It is, therefore, prayed that the impugned order 
dated 11.06.2001 be declared to be void, illegal, 
without lawful authority and consequently of no legal 
effect. It is further prayed that the respondent be 
restrained  from  making  any  recovery  from  the 
petitioner on the basis of the impugned order till 
final order on this petition." 

 5. 

Vide  order  dated  24.09.2001,  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court restrained recoveries from the respondent until 

the  next  date.  This  matter  was  adjourned  on  a 

number  of  occasions  without  specifically  extending 

the  operation  of  the  said  ad-interim  relief.  However, 

on  25.02.2004,  it  was  ordered  that  the  operation  of 

the stay order will continue till the decision of the writ 

petition.  Vide  order  dated  30.03.2004,  the  said  writ 

petition was disposed of in the following terms:-  

"Mian  Saif-ur-Rehman,  Advocate,  learned 
counsel  for  the  respondent-  National  Highway 
Authority  states  that  the  respondent  National 
Highway authority will strictly follow the terms of the 
contract. Their right of deduction will be subjected 
to  a  decision  by  the  arbitrator.  Meanwhile,  no 
recovery shall be effected from the petitioners. In 
case the matter is not referred to the arbitration the 
National Highway authority can proceed for the 
recovery, certainly, in accordance with the terms of 
the contract. Disposed of with agreement of the 
learned counsel for the parties."  

 6. 

On  28.04.2004, 

the 

respondent 

filed  an 

application  under  Section  8  of  the  1940  Act  before 

the  Court  of  learned  Civil  Judge  Islamabad,  praying 

for  the  appointment  of  an  arbitrator  in  accordance 

with  the  provisions  of  the  1940  Act  as  envisaged  in 

the contract dated 06.04.1993. The dispute which the 

respondent  wanted  to  be  referred  to  arbitration  was 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
5 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

whether  Rs.31.200  Million  or  any  lesser  amount  was 

recoverable by the appellant from the respondent on 

account  of  not  using  Cellulose  Fibers  in  the  asphalt 

base course mix in the road works. Vide order dated 

22.04.2006,  the  learned  Civil  Court,  appointed  Brig. 

Safdar  Hussain  Awan  as  a  sole  arbitrator  and 

referred the matters in dispute between the appellant 

and  the  respondent  for  his  determination.  The 

learned  sole  arbitrator  is  said  to  have  received  the 

said  order  of  the  learned  civil  court  on  10.05.2006. 

Vide  a  detailed  and  well  reasoned  arbitration  award 

dated 25.06.2007, the learned sole arbitrator decided 

the disputes referred to him in inter alia the following 

terms:- 

"48.  Having taken into consideration all the facts, 
evidence and arguments, I am firmly of the opinion 
that the claims of NHA against CPECC, HCL and 
SKB, respectively amounting to Rs.31.200 Million, 
Rs.206.632  Million  and  Rs.80.446  Million,  are 
barred by time and hence not recoverable. None of 
the parties had claimed the costs, hence none is 
payable to any.  
49.  ….  NHA,  at  its  end,  may  look  into  the 
circumstances under which it has suffered financial 
loss on account of inability to recover amount from 
the three concerned contractors for non use of 
Cellulose Fibre in the Asphaltic Base Course, and 
how did it fail to raise its claims even after 11 June 
2001 when it eventually did become alive to its 
entitlement and when it would have been quite in 
time to do so. Factually, the recoveries on account 
of non use of Cellulose Fibre should have been 
affected right with effect from the time that the first 
running  payment  for  laying  of  Asphaltic  Base 
Course was made in case of each of the seven 
contracts, which was at a time around 1995." 

 7. 

On  08.10.2007,  the  appellant  filed  an  objection 

petition  under  Sections  30  and  33  of  the  1940  Act 

before  the  learned  civil  court  and  prayed  for  the 

setting  aside  of 

the  arbitration  award  dated 

25.06.2007.  Vide 

judgment  &  decree  dated 

20.04.2015, the learned civil court dismissed the said 

objection  petition  and  made  the  arbitration  award 

dated 25.06.2007 a rule of Court. Furthermore, it was 

held  that  Rs.31.200  Million  or  a  lesser  amount  is  not 

 
 
  
 
6 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

recoverable by the appellant from the respondent on 

account of non-use  of Cellulose  Fibers  in the asphalt 

base  course  mix.  It  is  against  the  said  judgment  & 

decree  dated  20.04.2015  that  the  appellant  has 

preferred the instant appeal. 

 8. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted 

that  the  learned  trial  court  erred  by  passing  a 

judgment  &  decree  in  terms  of  the  arbitration  award 

dated  25.06.2007  and  dismissing  the  appellant's 

objections under Sections 30 and 33 of the 1940 Act; 

that  the  learned  arbitrator  had  erred  by  holding  that 

the  appellant’s  claim  was  barred  by  time;  that  the 

Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  had  restrained  the 

appellant  from  recovering  Rs.31.200  Million  from  the 

respondent for not using Cellulose Fibers in the road 

works; that the period between 24.09.2001 (when the 

injunctive  order  was  passed)  and  30.03.2004  (when 

writ petition No.2978/2001 was disposed of) has to be 

discounted  and  excluded  from  the  limitation  period 

for  instituting  proceedings  for  the  recovery  of  the 

said amount; that the learned trial court had erred by 

not  giving  the  appellant  the  benefit  of  Section  15  of 

the  Limitation  Act,  1908;  that  the  learned  arbitrator 

did  not  decide  the  claim  of  the  appellant  on  merits 

and unlawfully spurned it as barred by time; that even 

if the  appellant had not sought  the benefit  of Section 

15  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908,  in  the  proceedings 

before  the  learned  arbitrator  and  the  learned  Trial 

Court,  the  same  should  have  been  nonetheless 

extended  to  him;  that  even  without  an  objection 

petition,  it  was  obligatory  upon  the  learned  Trial 

Court to scrutinize the arbitration award to see that it 

does  not  suffer  from  any  invalidity.  In  making  these 

submissions,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of  A.  Qutubuddin  Khan 

VS  Chec  Millwala  Dredging  Co.  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  Steel 

House,  Karachi  (PLJ  2014  SC  950),  North-West

Collector, Abbotabad and another VS Abdul Ghafoor 

Khan  through  Legal  Heirs  and  two  others  (PLD  1993 

SC  418),  M/s.  Awan  Industries  Ltd  VS  The  Executive 

Engineer,  Lined  Channel  Division  and  another  (1992 

SCMR 65), and Kashmir Corporation Ltd VS Pakistan 

International Airlines (PLD 1995 Karachi 301).  

9. 

Learned  counsel 

for  the  appellant 

further 

submitted  that  the  appellant  had  filed  an  application 

under Section 12 (2) C.P.C. against the judgment and 

decree  dated  20.04.2015  before  the  learned  Trial 

Court;  that  a  judgment  and  decree  in  terms  of  an 

arbitrator  award  can  be  challenged  through  an 

application  under  Section  12  (2)  C.P.C.,  if  the  same 

was  vitiated  by  fraud  or  misrepresentation;  and  that 

under  the  decision  of  the  learned  Trial  Court  on  the 

said  application,  these  proceedings  should  either  be 

stayed  or  adjourned  sine  die.    In  making  these 

submissions,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  titled  as    Happy  Family 

Associate 

through  Chief  Executive  VS  Messrs 

Pakistan  International  Trading  Company  (PLD  2006 

SC  226),  Muhammad  Yasin  VS  Sh.  Hanif  Ahmed  and 

14  others  (1993  SCMR  437),  Raja  Wali  VS  Mansha 

Ahmed  (PLD  1996  Lahore  354),  and  Mrs.  Rukhsana 

Parveen VS Syed Shabahat Hussain Naqvi (2007 CLC 

1247).   

 10.  On  the  other  hand  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondent  submitted  that  as  the  appellant  had  filed 

an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  before  the 

learned  Trial Court  against  the  judgment  and  decree 

dated  20.04.2015,  he  was  precluded  from  filing  the 

instant  appeal;  that  two  remedies  against  the  same 

judgment and decree could not have been availed by 

the  appellant;  that  on  this  score  alone,  the  appeal  is 

liable  to  be  dismissed;  that  the  appeal  is  barred  by 

time; that on 20.04.2015, the impugned judgment was 

 
 
 
8 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

passed; that on 14.05.2015, the appellant applied for 

the  certified  copy  of  the  said  judgment;  that  the 

certified  copy  of  the  said  judgment  is  prepared  and 

delivered on 28.05.2015; that the appeal was filed on 

11.07.2015;  that  an  office  objection  was  raised  on 

14.07.2015, and the appeal was returned, and was re-

filed  on  02.11.2015;  and  that  Article  156  of  the 

Limitation Act,  1908, provides for limitation period of 

ninety  days  for  an  appeal  under  Section  39  of  the 

Arbitration  Act.  In  making  these  submissions,  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  placed  reliance 

on  the  cases  titled  as  Tanveer  Siddiqui  and  another 

VS  Muhammad  Rashid  (2010  YLR  1851),  Syed 

Jammat  Ali  Shah  and  others  VS 

Investment 

Corporation  of  Pakistan  Ltd,  Karachi  (1989  MLD 

3931), Lahore Development Authority VS Muhammad 

Rashid (1997 SCMR 1224), Collector Land Acquisition 

Abbotabad  and  others  VS  Fazal-ur-Rehman  and 

others  (2009  SCMR  767),  and  Province  of  Punjab 

through 

Secretary, 

Local  Government 

and 

Community  Development,  Lahore  and  three  others 

(2014 CLC 417). 

11.  On  the  merits  of  the  case,  learned  counsel  for 

the  respondent  submitted  that  vide  interim  order 

dated  24.09.2001,  passed  in  W.P.No.2978/2001,  the 

Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  had  restrained  the 

appellant 

from  making 

recoveries 

from 

the 

respondent, but had not restrained the appellant from 

instituting  legal  proceedings  for  the  recovery  of 

Rs.31.200  Million  due  to  the  Cellulose  Fibers  not 

being used by the respondent in the road works; that 

on  28.04.2004,  it  was  the  respondent  who  filed  an 

application  under  Section  8  of  the  1940  Act  for  the 

reference  of  the  said  dispute  to  arbitration;  that  the 

perusal  of  the  arbitration  award  reveals  that  the 

learned  arbitrator  was  cognizant  of  the  said  orders 

dated  24.09.2001  and  30.03.2004,  passed  by  the 

 
 
9 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

Hon'ble Lahore High Court in W.P.No.2987/2001; that 

the 

learned  arbitrator  had  framed  an 

issue  on 

whether  the  NHA's  claim  is  maintainable  and  time 

barred;  that  this  issue  was  decided  against  the 

appellant  and  its  claim  was  held  to  be  time  barred; 

that  the  arbitration  award 

is  detailed  and  well 

reasoned  and  called  for  no  interference  by  the 

learned trial court; that as the learned arbitrator had 

not  committed  any  misconduct  in  the  arbitration 

proceedings, 

the 

learned 

trial  court  correctly 

dismissed  the  appellant's  objections  against  the 

arbitration  award  dated  25.06.2007,  by  passing  a 

judgment & decree in terms thereof.  In making these 

submissions,  the  learned  counsel  for  the respondent 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of  National  Highway 

Authority  VS  Zarghoon  Enterprises  (Pvt.)  Ltd  (2015 

MLD  746),  Mian  Corporation  through  Managing 

Partner  VS  Messrs  Lever  Brothers  of  Pakistan  Ltd 

through  General  Sales  Manager,  Karachi  (PLD  2006 

SC  169),  Muhammad  Farooq  Shah  VS  Shakirullah 

(2006  SCMR  1657),  Pakistan  Steel  Mills  Corporation, 

Karachi  VS  Messrs  Mustafa  Sons  (Pvt.)  Ltd,  Karachi 

(PLD  2003  SC  301),  and  Federation  of  Pakistan 

through  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Food,  Islamabad  and 

others  VS  Messrs.  Joint  Venture  Kocks  K.G./RIst 

(PLD 2011 SC 506).  

12. 

In  rejoinder,  the 

learned  counsel 

for  the 

appellant  submitted  that  no  notice  had  been  issued 

by the office to the appellant or its counsel regarding 

the  office  objection;  and  that  the  office  did  not 

indicate a date by which the office objections were to 

be removed and the appeal re-filed. Learned counsel 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of  Province  of  Punjab 

through District Collector Lodhran and six others VS 

Muhammad  Khalid  Khan  (2005  CLC  1083),  and  Mst. 

Sabiran Bi VS Ahmad Khan and another (2000 SCMR 

847).

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

13. 

I  have  heard  the  arguments  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  parties  and  have  perused  the  record 

with their able assistance.  

14. 

I propose first to deal  with the  objection  raised 

by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  that  the 

appeal filed by the appellant was barred by time. The 

learned  counsel  for  the  contesting  parties  were  in 

agreement  that  the  limitation  period  for  an  appeal 

under  Section  39  of  the  1940  Act  is  ninety  days 

computed  from  the  date  of  the  order  appealed  from. 

The  judgment  and  decree  impugned  in  the  appeal 

was passed on 20.04.2015. The record shows that the 

appellant applied for its certified copy on 14.05.2015. 

This  copy  was  prepared  and  delivered  to  the 

appellant  on  28.05.2015.  The  appeal  was  filed  on 

11.07.2015, and was returned with an office objection 

on  14.07.2015.  This  appeal  was  then  re-filed  on 

02.11.2015.  Now,  if  the  period  between  14.07.2015 

(when the office objection was raised and the appeal 

returned)  and  02.11.2015  (when  the  appeal  was  re-

filed)  is  not  excluded,  the  appeal  would  certainly  be 

barred  by  time.  Perusal  of  the office objection  (Diary 

No.942/2015)  dated  14.07.2015 

issued  by 

the 

Assistant Registrar and Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of 

this  Court  reveals  that  the  office  did  not  stipulate  a 

period  within  which  the  office  objections  have  to  be 

removed.  The  period  within  which 

the  office 

objections were required to be removed has been left 

blank. The office objections taken are (1) that page 7 

of  the  petition  has  to  be  re-typed  because  it  is  not 

legible due  to  cutting  and  correction,  (2)  that  the  file 

is  not  arranged  according  to  the  index/rules  and  (3) 

that the attested power of attorney had not been filed. 

Now,  it  is  not  disputed  that  originally  the appeal was 

filed  within 

time.  The  above  mentioned  office 

objections  are  not  such  as  would  render  the  very 

appeal  incompetent.  In  other  words,  as  per  these

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

office  objections,  the  appeal  did  not  suffer  from  any 

fatal defect. These objections were at best ministerial 

in  nature.  As  the  appeal  was  originally  filed  within 

time  but  was  deficient  in  some  respects,  and  these 

deficiencies were cleared by the appellant before re-

filing the appeal, the appeal cannot be held to be time 

barred particularly when the office did not indicate a 

time within which the deficiencies had to be cleared. I 

feel  that  the  appellant  cannot  be  penalized  for  the 

inaction  of  the  office  by  not  fixing  a  period  within 

which  the  office  objections  were  required  to  be 

removed.  The  record  is  also  silent  as  to  any  notice 

issued by the office to the appellant for the removal of 

the office objections.    

15. 

In  the  case  of  Mst.  Sabiran  Bi  VS  Ahmad  Khan 

and  another  (2000  SCMR  847),  it  has  been  held  as 

follows:- 

“Thus, in view of above discussions we are inclined 
to hold that once a suit, appeal or revision has been 
presented  before  the  authorized  officer  of  the 
Court within the prescribed period of limitation, it 
cannot be treated barred by time for the reason 
that the office has noted defects in the proceedings 
which have not been removed by the concerned 
party or his Advocate, and in such-like situation the 
Presiding Officer of the Court at the best can 
consider the maintainability of proceedings in view 
of the provisions of Order VII, Rule II or identical 
provisions available in the Code of Civil Procedure 
or  the  law  under  which  the  proceedings were 
instituted.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that 
parties/Advocates are also not absolved from their 
duty to remove the office objections within the 
stipulated  period  prescribed  by  the  concerned 
authorized  officer  subject  to  the  condition  that 
specific notice has been served upon the party or 
Advocate to do the needful. Even if after notice the 
defect is not removed the case shall be listed for 
non-prosecution before the Presiding Officer who 
may in his discretion allow time to comply with 
objections of office.” 

 16. 

In the case of Farman Ali VS Muhammad Ishaq 

&  others  (PLD  2013  SC  392),  it  has  been  held  as 

follows:- 

"6.  The upshot of the above discussion is, that 
where a revision petition has been filed within time, 
but  the  office  objection(s)  points  out  certain 

 
 
 
 
12 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

deficiencies in respect of the institution, for all 
intents and purposes, it shall be deemed to have 
been instituted within the period of limitation and 
where the petitioner does not remove the office 
objections and make up the deficiencies in the time 
provided by the office, the matter shall be placed 
before the Court on the judicial  side and the Court 
shall  decide  about  the  fate  of  the  petition  in 
accordance with law, and as per some of the 
guidelines provided in the preceding part of this 
judgment." 

 17. 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Boota  VS  Basharat 

Ali  (PLD  2014  Lahore  01),  it  has  been  held  at 

paragraph 11 of the report as follows:- 

"11. In view of above discussion, we are of the 
opinion, that the appeal is originally filed within 
prescribed limitation period but was returned due 
to office objections which could not be removed 
within given time and when the office objections 
finally removed the prescribed period of limitation 
for filing appeal elapsed, will not render the appeal 
barred by time. In the present case, as originally 
the appeal was filed on 20.04.2013, which was 
within the prescribed period of limitation of 90 
days  and  only  because  office  objection  was 
removed on 02.05.2013, will not make the appeal 
barred by time, therefore, preliminary objection 
raised by the learned counsel for the respondent 
is over ruled."  

 18. 

It is only in cases where the delay in re-filing of 

an appeal, after an office objection, is far in excess of 

the period fixed by the office within which the appeal 

is to be re-filed after clearing the objections, that the 

courts  refuse 

indulgence 

in  entertaining  such 

appeals. For instance, in the case of Commissioner of 

Income Tax / Wealth Tax, Companies Zone, Islamabad 

VS  M/s  Dreamland  Motels  (Pvt)  Limited  (2012  PTD 

976), a delay of 2-1/2 years in re-filing the appeal was 

not  condoned  by  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble 

Islamabad  High  Court,  when  the  office  had  required 

the  appellant  to  remove  the  office  objection  within  a 

period  of  three  days.  Similarly,  in  the  case  of  M/s 

Pervez  &  Company  VS  National  Bank  of  Pakistan 

reported  as 2015  CLD  972, the Division Bench of the 

Hon'ble Lahore High Court did not condone a delay of 

 
 
  
  
 
 
 
13 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

more  than  three  years  in  the  re-filing  of  an  appeal 

after removing the office objections.  

 19. 

In view of the above, the respondent's objection 

regarding maintainability of the appeal on the ground 

of limitation, is spurned.  

 20.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the 

learned 

counsel  for  the  appellant  that  these  proceedings 

should  be  stayed  or  adjourned sine die until  the  trial 

court  adjudicates  upon  the  appellant's  application 

under Section 12(2) C.P.C. against  the judgment and 

decree  dated  20.04.2015,  I  cannot  bring  myself  to 

agree  with  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  for 

the simple reason that arbitration is essentially a time 

and  expense  saving  device.  Paragraph  3  of  the  First 

Schedule of the 1940 Act requires arbitrators to make 

their  award  within  a  period  of  four  months  after 

entering  on  the  reference.  The  very  purpose  of 

resolution  of  disputes  through  a  domestic  tribunal 

would  be  defeated  if  the  objections  to  an  arbitration 

award  or  appeals  from  judgments  and  decrees  in 

terms  of  the  arbitration  award  are  kept  pending 

indefinitely. The Courts should make an earnest effort 

to decide such objections and appeals in a time frame 

lesser than the one given by law to the arbitrators to 

decide a dispute. 

21.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  placed 

reliance  on  the  cases  of  Mrs.  Rukhsana  Parveen  VS 

Syed  Shabhat  Hussain  Naqvi  reported  as  2007  CLC 

1241 and Muhammad Yasin VS Sh. Hanif Ahmed and 

four others reported as 1993 SCMR 437, in support of 

his contention that a decree passed on the basis of an 

award  cannot  be  challenged  under  Sections  30  and 

33  of  the  1940  Act,  and  that  there  is  no  provision  in 

the  1940  Act  for  challenging  such  a  decree  on  the 

ground  that  the  same had  been  obtained  by  fraud  or 

misrepresentation. 

It  was  contended 

that 

the 

appellant  could  challenge  the  judgment  and  decree 

 
 
14 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

dated  20.04.2015  in  an  application  under  Section 

12(2)  C.P.C.  on  the  ground  that  it  has  been  obtained 

by  fraud  or  misrepresentation.  Now,  the  question  of 

the  maintainability  of  the  application  under  Section 

12(2) C.P.C. filed by the appellant before the learned 

Trial  Court,  is  not  before  this  Court.  The  appellant 

may, should he so desire take these pleas before the 

learned  Trial Court  adjudicating  upon  his  application 

under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  It  is  not  for  this  Court  in 

these proceedings to comment on the maintainability 

of  such  an  application  lest  it  may  prejudice  the  case 

of either party before the learned Trial Court. 

 22.  Learned  counsel 

for  the  appellant  placed 

reliance  on  the case of Raja  Wali  VS Mansha Ahmad 

reported  as  PLD  1996  Lahore  354,  in  support  of  his 

contention  that  the  mere  fact  that  the  appellant  had 

filed  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C. 

against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  20.04.2015 

does  not  preclude  him  from  filing  an  appeal  against 

the  said  decree.  True,  the  mere 

filing  of  an 

application under Section 12(2) CPC against the said 

judgment  &  decree  dated  20.04.2015  would  not 

render  the  instant  appeal  incompetent  but,  for  the 

reasons mentioned above, this appeal cannot be kept 

pending or adjourned sine die until the decision of the 

appellant's application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. by 

the  Trial  Court.  An  appeal  is  a  continuation  of  the 

proceedings  before  the  lower  courts  and  should,  in 

arbitration  matters,  be  decided  as  expeditiously  as 

possible.  

 23.  Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  also  placed 

reliance  on  the  case  of  Happy  Family  Associate 

through  Chief  Executive  VS  Messrs  Pakistan 

International Trading Company reported as PLD 2006 

Supreme  Court  226,  to 

justify  the  filing  of  an 

application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  as  well  as  an 

appeal  against 

the 

judgment  &  decree  dated 

 
 
15 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

20.04.2015.  In  the  said  case,  it  was  held  that  the 

application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  was  no 

substitute to regular appeal or revision or review nor 

such provision could be construed as something over 

and above the normal modes of questioning a decree 

by  way  of  an  appeal,  revision  or  review.  I  do  not see 

how  the  said  judgment  comes  to  the  aid  of  the 

appellant.  

 24. 

I now come to the appellant’s central ground for 

assailing the judgment and decree dated 20.04.2015, 

viz  that  the  learned  arbitrator  should  have  given  the 

appellant  the  benefit  of  Section  15  of  the  Limitation 

Act,  1908,  and  excluded  the  period  during  which  the 

injunctive  order  issued  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High 

Court remained in operation, in computing the period 

within  which  the  appellant  filed  a  claim  for  the 

recovery  of  Rs.31.200  Million  against  the respondent 

due  to  the  non-use  of  Cellulose  Fibers  in  the  asphalt 

base course mix. For ease of reference Section 15 (1) 

of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908,  is  reproduced  herein 

below:-  

"15.  Exclusion of time during which proceedings 
are suspended. (1) In computing the period of 
limitation prescribed for any suit or application for 
the  execution  of  a  decree,  the  institution  or 
execution of which has been stayed by injunction or 
order, the time of the continuance of the injunction 
or order, the day on which it was issued or made 
and the day on which it was withdrawn, shall be 
excluded." 

25.  The arbitration award dated 25.06.2007 reveals 

that  in  the  arbitration  proceedings,  the  respondent 

had  raised  the  objection  of  limitation  to  the  claim 

made  for  the  recovery  of  money  on  account  of  the 

non-use of Cellulose Fibers. The first issue framed by 

the learned arbitrator was "whether the claim of NHA 

raised after completion of project is maintainable or 

time barred?".  The  issues  framed  were  said  to  have 

been  accepted  by  the  contesting  parties  and  no 

objections  were  raised  thereto.  In  view  of  the  said 

 
 
 
16 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

issue,  the appellant ought  to have sought the benefit 

of  Section  15  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908,  in  the 

arbitration  proceedings.  This,  the  appellant  did  not 

do.  

 26.  Perusal  of 

the  arbitration  award  dated 

25.06.2007,  and  the  appellant's  objection  petition 

under  Sections  30  and  33  of  the  1940  Act  filed  on 

08.10.2007,  reveal  that  the  appellant  had,  neither 

before  the  learned  arbitrator  nor  before  the  learned 

Trial  Court,  taken  the  plea  of  exclusion  of  the  time 

during the subsistence of the injunctive order passed 

by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  from  the  limitation 

period,  under  Section  15  of  the  Limitation  Act,  1908. 

The  appellant  must  now  thank  himself  for  the 

unsavory consequences of this omission.  

 27.  Even  otherwise,  the  contention  of  the  learned 

counsel for the appellant that the period during which 

the  injunctive  relief  granted  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore 

High  Court  to  the  respondent  in  W.P.No.2978/2001, 

subsisted,  should  be  excluded  from  the  limitation 

period  within  which  the  appellant  could  institute 

proceedings  for  the  recovery  of  Rs.31.200  Million, 

has  to  be  examined  by  reading  the  order  dated 

24.09.2001  as  a  whole.  This  Order  is  reproduced 

herein below:-  

"Grievance of the petitioner is highlighted in 
paragraphs 10 & 11 of the writ petition which are 
reproduced below: 

"In the case of the Project the Job Mix 
Formula jointly established by the petitioner 
and the Engineer/Consultant did not include 
the use of Cellulose Fibers. The petitioner 
proceeded  to  provide/use  the  asphalt 
concrete base course mixture for the road 
portion of the Project. It may be pertinently 
mentioned here that 66 km long portion of 
the road, which has been open to traffic 
during the last year, is in excellent condition 
and  has  not  shown  any  bleeding/rutting 
tendencies whatsoever.  
  By  order  dated  11.06.2001  the 
respondent  has  instructed  its  General 
Managers/others  officers  to  recover 
specified amounts from the petitioner (and 
other contractors) for non use/non addition 

 
 
 
 
17 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

of Cellulose Fibers in the asphalt concrete 
base course mixture. The amount ordered to 
be recovered from the petitioner in the case 
of the Project is Rs.31.200 million." 
2. 
It has been stated that after 8 year a dispute 
has been raised with respect to the use of Cellulose 
Fiber in asphalt along with the Job Mixer Formula. 
Whereas the roads already constructed did not 
suffer  from  any  bleeding  and  there  was  no 
requirement for mixing Cellulose Fiber and that this 
was agreed by the Engineer who had to get the 
work  executed  along with  the  contractor.  That 
withholding of Rs.31.200 million because of the 
impugned order dated 11.06.2001 was an illegal 
act. That even if the respondent had a case, it was 
referable to an arbitrator and the respondent could 
not arbitrarily order for recovery of the said amount 
from the petitioner and other contractors. That the 
petitioner  is  a  company  of  renown  working  in 
Pakistan and is being subjected to harassment 
unnecessarily. 

Notice to the respondent.  
3. 
Incidentally Rana Muhammad Tariq, Adv. is 
present in Court. He accepts notice on behalf of the 
respondent.  He  is  directed  to  file  parawise 
comments within two weeks.  
CM No.5617/2001 

4.  Notice. Recovery shall not be made from the 
petitioner until the next date.  
5.  To  come  up  on  9.10.2001."  (Emphasis 
added) 

 28.  The  first  ground  taken  in  W.P.No.2978/2001 

reads inter alia as follows:-  

"Each of the contracts has a settlement of disputes 
clause which inter alia lays down that a dispute 
between the petitioner and the respondent shall, in 
the  first  instance  be  referred  to  the 
Engineer/Consultant for his decision, and if either 
party  is  aggrieved  by  the  decision  of  the 
Engineer/Consultant the said aggrieved party may 
ask for arbitration as specified in the said clause. "  

 29.  Perusal of the grounds taken in the writ petition 

in conjunction with the order dated 24.09.2001 shows 

that the respondent's case before the Hon'ble Lahore 

High  Court  was  that  the  dispute  regarding  the 

recovery  of  Rs.31.200  Million,  was  referable  to  an 

arbitrator  and  that  the appellant  could  not arbitrarily 

order 

its  recovery.  Examining  the  case 

in  this 

perspective,  I  am  of  the  view  that  there  was  no 

impediment  placed  on  the  appellant  by  the  said 

injunctive order to institute arbitration proceedings in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
18 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

accordance  with  clause  67  of  the  contract  between 

the  appellant  and  the  respondent  for  the  recovery  of 

the said amount. What was restrained by the Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court  was  the  process  for  the  recovery 

of  the  said  amount  initiated  by  the  appellant  through 

its letter dated 11.06.2001, which had been impugned 

in the said writ petition.  

 30.  The  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  through  its 

order  dated  24.09.2001  had  not  restrained  the 

appellant 

from 

instituting  a  suit  or  arbitration 

proceedings.  Even  after  the  injunctive  order  was 

vacated  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  on 

30.03.2004,  the  appellant  did  not  institute  or  initiate 

arbitration proceedings for the recovery of Rs.31.200 

Million  from  the  respondent  for  not  using  Cellulose 

Fibers  in  the  asphalt  base  course  mix.  It  was  the 

respondent which, on 28.04.2004 filed an application 

for  reference  of  the  said  dispute  to  arbitration. 

Hence,  I  do  not  find  the  appellant  entitled  to  the 

benefit of Section 15 of the Limitation Act, 1908.  

 31.  The  learned  arbitrator,  through  a  detailed  23 

page  arbitration  award,  dealt  with  the  respective 

claims  of  the  contesting  parties.  The  claim  of  the 

appellant  on  account  of  the  non-use  of  the  Cellulose 

Fibers in the asphalt base course mix, was dealt with 

by the learned arbitrator in the following terms:-  

"43.  During  execution  of  the  work,  however, 
Cellulose Fiber was not used at all in any of the 
projects, in Asphaltic Base Course or Asphaltic 
Wearing  Course.  The  individual  projects  were 
completed  in  respective  time,  the  last  being 
completed during June, 2002, and final bills paid. 
No recoveries were to be made on account of non 
use of Cellulose Fiber in case of Asphaltic Wearing 
Course, since payment of Cellulose Fiber had to be 
based  on  its  quantity,  in  KG,  used.  However, 
recovery on account of non use of Cellulose Fiber 
in Asphaltic Base Course was justifiable. NHA, 
during June 2001, initiated recoveries through its 
internal  letter  (Exhibit-1)  from  the  three 
contractors, among others, based on non use of 
Cellulose Fiber in the Asphaltic Base Course, and 
hence this Arbitration." 

 
 
 
 
19 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

"46.  ….. However, NHA all along, never initiated a 
recovery notice to any of the affected contractors 
nor ever raised its claim against any of them, which 
is extremely strange and unexpected. The first time 
ever  that NHA raised claims  against  the  three 
contractors (CPECC, HCL & SKB) was on 11 June 
2006, that too as fulfillment of obligation of this 
Arbitration. NHA, for unknown reasons, allowed 
well over three years to elapse after completion of 
each of the seven contracts and did not raise any 
claim, thereby depriving itself of the right to affect 
recovery. Thus, as established by the Counsel for 
HCL & SKB, under Article 115 of the Limitation Act, 
since more than three years had passed since 
completion of projects, through the cause of action 
had arisen years earlier than  completion when 
Cellulose Fiber's non use had been first known, the 
claim of NHA had become time barred……"  

 32.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  contesting  parties 

read  over  most  of  the  arbitration  award  during  the 

hearing  of  the  appeal.  I  was  not  able  to  find  any 

infirmity  or  invalidity  in  the  same.  There  is  nothing 

apparent on the surface of the record to indicate any 

misconduct on the part of the learned arbitrator. It is 

settled law that a court while examining the validity of 

an  award  does  not  sit  as  a court of appeal.  It  cannot 

undertake  reappraisal  of  evidence.  For  a  court  to 

interfere  in  an  arbitration  award,  there  has  to  be  an 

error on the face of it and discoverable by reading the 

award itself. The learned Trial Court has been mindful 

not 

to  scrutinize 

the  arbitration  award  dated 

25.06.2007  by applying the yardstick of an appeal.  

 33. 

In the cases of Kashmir Corporation Limited VS 

Pakistan International Airlines reported as (PLD 1995 

Karachi  301),  and  Messrs  Awan  Industrial  Ltd  VS 

Executive  Engineer  Lined  Channel  Division,  (1992 

SCMR  65),  it  has  been  held  that  it  was  obligatory  for 

the  arbitrator  to  determine  whether  the  claim  of  a 

party  before  it  was  barred  by  time,  and  that  an 

arbitration  award  which  does  not  take  into  account 

the  fact  that  their  claim  was  barred  by  limitation, 

could  not  be  made  a  rule  of  court.  The  learned 

arbitrator, in the instant case, has in accordance with 

 
 
 
20 

F.A.O. No.88 of 2015 

the law laid down in the said judgments correctly held 

that the appellant’s claim of 31.200 Million against the 

respondent  for  not  using  Rs.31.200  Million  from  the 

respondent  for  not  using  Cellulose  Fibers  in  the 

asphalt base course mix, was barred by time.  

 34.  By  reason  of  the  aforementioned,  I  find  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  20.04.2015,  passed  by 

the  learned  Civil  Court  to  be  strictly  in  accordance 

with the law. Hence, this appeal is dismissed with no 

order as to costs.
