Date of Decision:

MOHSIN AKHTAR KAYANI, J: By way of this common judgment, this 

Court  intends  to  decide  the  captioned  writ  petitions  having  involved  similar 

facts and parties.  

2. 

Through 

the  captioned  W.P.  No.1643/2021, 

the  Shahid  Farooq 

(petitioner) has called in question the judgment and decree of the learned Judge 

Family  /  Guardian  Court  (East),  Islamabad,  dated  27.01.2021,  whereby  suit 

filed by Mst. Shaheen Kausar (respondent No.2) for dissolution of marriage on 

the basis of Khulla has been decreed. 

3. 

Similarly, through the captioned W.P. No.3434/2021, the petitioner Mst. 

Shaheen  Kausar  seeks  issuance  of  direction  to  the  Chairman  Arbitration 

Council to  record the statement  of  petitioner in  writing  with regard  to refusal

from  reconciliation  with  Shahid  Farooq  (respondent  No.2)  as  well  as  to  issue 

divorce certificate to the petitioner.   

4. 

For  the  purpose  of  brevity,  Shahid  Farooq  is  hereinafter  referred  to  as 

“petitioner / husband” and Mst. Shaheen Kausar as “respondent / wife”. 

5. 

Brief and consolidated facts are that a marriage between Shahid Farooq 

(petitioner) and Mst. Shaheen Kausar (respondent) solemnized on 25.02.2007 in 

accordance  with  Muslim  rites  and  ceremony  against  a  dower  of  20  Tola  gold 

ornaments,  as such,  as  per the  respondent’s contention  the  petitioner  failed  to 

keep cordial relationship with the respondent, rather kept her in a far flung area 

of KPK having no basic necessities of life, per se, the respondent was allegedly 

ousted by petitioner’s family from their house on 07.01.2020. Consequently, the 

respondent filed a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khulla, which 

was  contested  by  the  petitioner,  as  such,  after  recording  of  pro  and  contra 

evidence,  the  learned  trial  Court  vide  impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.01.2021  decreed  the  suit.  Feeling  aggrieved  thereof,  the  petitioner  filed  the 

captioned W.P. No.1643/2021.  

6. 

On the other hand, in pursuance of the impugned judgment and decree, 

the  respondent  (wife)  filed  application  on  17.02.2021  before  the  Chairman, 

Arbitration Council seeking issuance of a certificate for effectiveness of divorce, 

but the same was consigned to record room, as a result whereof, the respondent 

filed the captioned W.P. No.3434/2021. 

7. 

Learned counsel for petitioner (Shahid Farooq) contends that impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated  27.01.2021  not  merely  suffer  from  material 

illegality, but travel against the record itself; that the respondent never wanted 

Khula  from  petitioner,  rather  she  was  compelled  to  opt  for  it  by  the  family 

members, as such, the findings recorded in the impugned judgment qua return 

of  the  dower  amount  are  vague  and  do  not  qualify  to  be  a  legal  order  on  the 

face  of  it,  per  se,  the  learned  trial  Court  has  not  appreciated  the  overall 

 
 
W.P.No.1643/2021 and W.P. No.3434/2021 

Page | 3 

circumstances  of  the  case,  rather  resorted  to  passing  the  impugned  judgment 

and decree in a hasty manner.  

8. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  (Mst.  Shaheen  Kausar) 

stressed  that  the  Chairman  Arbitration  Council  has  illegally  relied  upon  the 

statement  of  petitioner 

that  respondent  does  not  want  reconciliation 

whatsoever  with  the  petitioner,  which  is  contrary  to  the  record,  in  pursuance 

whereof  the  Chairman  Arbitration  Council  has  illegally  consigned  the  file 

under  the  influence  of  petitioner  causing  miscarriage  of 

justice  to  the 

respondent,  even  otherwise, 

the  petitioner 

filed 

the  captioned  W.P. 

No.1643/2021 by concealing material facts with malafide in order to achieve a 

favorable  order  in  his  favour;  that  the  respondent  has  been  condemned 

unheard while consigning the application filed by the respondent on 17.02.2021. 

9. 

10. 

Arguments heard, record perused.   

Perusal of record reveals that petitioner is aggrieved with the judgment 

and  decree  dated  27.01.2021,  whereby  respondent  Mst.  Shaheena  Kausar  has 

filed suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, which was allowed 

in  her  favour  and  the  marriage  between  the  parties  dated  25.02.2007  stands 

dissolved.  

11. 

Counsel for the petitioner has taken a stance that respondent intends to 

reconcile with the petitioner on all counts, but she was forced to live apart from 

petitioner husband  on  the  pressure  of  her  family,  though  this  aspect  has  been 

considered by the Trial Court, where proper opportunity of reconciliation was 

provided  in  terms  of  Section  10  of  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  whereby 

respondent ex-wife has recorded her stance before the Judge Family Court in an 

unequivocal terms, whereby trial Court has observed the following:- 

“I am of the considered opinion that due to the persistent insulting and 
abusive behavior of the defendant and his family, she has developed acute 
hatred and aversion against him and there is no probability between the 
parties  to  live  together  as  husband  and  wife  or  to  lead  a  happy  and 

 
 
W.P.No.1643/2021 and W.P. No.3434/2021

harmonious  life.  Therefore,  the  reconciliation  between  the  parties  is 
failed and issue No.1 is decided in favour of the plaintiff. 

12. 

The  above  aspect  clearly  establishes  that  pre-trial  reconciliation 

proceedings have been failed and decree of Khula has been passed accordingly 

under the law. 

13. 

The proviso in terms of Section 10(4) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 has 

been  asserted  by  the  Ordinance,  2002  with  intent  that  if  reconciliation  fails 

between the parties in the Family  Court, the decree shall be passed forthwith, 

but  petitioner  has  challenged  the  same  on  an  artificial  ground  through  the 

instant writ petition and at the same time, he has filed the application before the 

Chairman,  Arbitration  Council,  not  to  issue  a  certificate  of  effectiveness  of 

divorce, which is the subject matter of W.P No. 3434/2021, filed by respondent 

ex-wife. 

14. 

This Court has called Mst. Shaheena Kausar/respondent and confronted 

her qua the reconciliation, whereby she in categorical terms refused to live with 

petitioner anymore and the same stance  has been recorded in the  order  dated 

18.02.2022, therefore, the intent of the law has to prevail, whereby no appeal has 

been provided against the dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, hence 

no writ is entertainable in this regard as no illegality or jurisdictional defect is 

apparent in this case.  

15.  However,  during  course  of  proceedings  of  instant  case,  this  Court  has 

also called the Chairman, Arbitration Council and he has been confronted qua 

the  situation  in  hand,  whereby  certificate  of  effectiveness  of  divorce  has  not 

been  issued,  the  Chairman,  Arbitration  Council  in  person  contends  that 

petitioner  has  filed  application  qua  the  pendency  of  the  matter  before  this 

Court,  as  a  result  whereof,  said  certificate  was  not  issued,  though  the 

reconciliation  has  been  failed  between  the  parties.  The  Chairman,  Arbitration 

Council  has  produced  the  original  certificate  of  effectives  of  divorce  today  in 

 
 
 
W.P.No.1643/2021 and W.P. No.3434/2021

the  Court  and  the  original  certificate  of  effectiveness  of  divorce  has  been 

handed  over  to  Mst.  Shaheena  Kausar.  Copy  of  the  same  has  been  placed  on 

record. 

16. 

In  such  scenario  Writ  Petition  No.  1643/2021  being  misconceived  is 

hereby  DISMISSED.  Whereas  W.P  No.  3434/2021  is  DISPOSED  OF  as  the 

grievance of the petitioner has been redressed, therefore the same has become 

borne fruit.
