MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:  By  way  of  this  common  judgment, 

this  Court  intends  to  decide  the  captioned  writ  petitions  having  similar 

questions of law and involving similar parties.  

2. 

Brief and consolidated facts are that petitioner Babar Shabbir and Asia 

Mehboob  (respondent  wife)  married  on  23.06.2019  and  were  blessed  with  a 

baby  girl  on  19.04.2020,  who  was  suffering  from  Atrial  Septal  Defect  (ASD) 

and  Secundum  (hole  in  the  heart),  as  a  result  whereof,  the  relationship 

between the spouses became strained and ultimately the petitioner announced 

divorce  upon  respondent  wife  on  20.08.2020  without  handing  over  back  the 

gold ornaments weighing eight Tolas or maintenance of the minor to meet the 

medical expenditures, as such, this compelled the respondent wife to file a suit 

for  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance,  dowry  articles  and  gold  ornaments, 

which  was  partially  decreed  vide  impugned  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree 

dated 18.01.2021 to the extent of maintenance of minor @ Rs.5,000/- per month 

and Rs.10,000/- per month for respondent wife w.e.f. April, 2020 till expiry of

her  Iddat  period,  whereas  the  suit  was  dismissed  to  the  extent  of  dowry 

articles  and  gold  ornaments.  Feeling  aggrieved  thereof,  the  petitioner 

preferred an appeal, which has been dismissed vide impugned judgment and 

decree dated 14.07.2021 declaring the same as time barred. Hence, instant writ 

petition.  

3. 

Learned counsel for petitioner contends that the both the Courts below 

have  not  appreciated  the  documentary  evidence  available  on  record,  rather 

resorted  to  pass  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  in  a  slipshod  manner; 

that the respondents with malafide intention mentioned wrong address of the 

petitioner in order to attain ex-parte judgment and decree, as a result whereof 

the petitioner also learnt about passing of the ex-parte judgment and decree at 

belated stage, but the learned first Appellate Court has not taken into account 

such  dubious  conduct  on  the  part  of  respondents  and  dismissed  the  appeal 

filed by the petitioner, even otherwise, the respondent wife was self-deserted 

lady, therefore, she was not entitled for past maintenance.  

4. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.1  and  2  stressed  that 

the  petitioner  having  orthodox  attitude  was  annoyed  with  respondent  No.1 

(wife)  for  giving  birth  to  a  daughter  (respondent  No.2),  who  was  otherwise 

suffering  from  Atrial  Septal  Defect  (ASD)  and  Secundum,  as  such,  the 

petitioner  instead  of  taking  care  of  the  minor  announced  a  divorce  upon  the 

respondent  wife  on  20.08.2020  and  deserted  her  without  giving  her  the 

personal belongings and gold ornaments weighing 08 Tolas given at the time 

of marriage as gift, per se, both the Courts below have rightly appreciated the 

overall circumstances of the case and right decreed the suit.

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused.   

Perusal of record reveals that petitioner Babar Shabbir and respondent 

Asia  Mehboob  were  married  to  each  other  on  23.06.2019  in  accordance  with

Muslim  rites  and  ceremony,  whereas  08  Tolas  Gold  have  been  given  to  the 

wife,  specifically  provided  in  Column  17  of the  Nikahnama,  Ex.P2.  Both  were 

blessed  with  daughter  namely  Zahra  Fatima,  who  is  presently  in  custody  of 

real  mother,  but  later,  on  parties  have  developed  acute  disparity,  which 

resulted  into  divorce  pronounced  by  the  petitioner  through  Ex.P3  on 

20.08.2020.  During  the  period  of  desertion  of  the  respondent  wife,  the  same 

has  been  transmitted  through  Ex.P4,  the  birth  registration  certificate  Ex.P5, 

date  of  birth  of  minor  as  19  April,  2020  available  on  record.  Respondent  ex-

wife  Asia  Mehboob  has  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance, 

dowry articles and gold ornaments, which has been decided through ex-parte 

judgment  and  decree  in  her  favour  on  18.01.2021,  whereby  she  has  been 

granted relief of maintenance alongwith minorâ€™s expenditure w.e.f. April, 2020 

to  the  extent  of  minor  @Rs.5,000/-  per  month  till  her  legal  entitlement  with 

10% annual increase and maintenance to the extent of respondent wife at the 

rate of Rs.10,000/- per month  was also  passed w.e.f April,  2020 till expiry  of 

her Iddat period, but the gold jewelry has not been referred in the impugned 

judgments,  as  a  result  whereof,  she  filed  an  appeal  before  District  Judge  to 

that  extent, whereas petitioner has also  filed  an appeal before  District  Judge, 

against the same judgment.  

7. 

Both  the  matters  were  decided  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

vide  judgments  and  decrees  dated  14.07.2021  and  04.09.2021  separately, 

whereby  the  appeal  filed  by  the  petitioner  has  been  dismissed  being  time 

barred,  though  the  petitioner  has  taken  a  stance  that  he  has  been  proceeded 

ex-parte and he has not received any notice from the trial Court, which aspect 

has been deprecated by learned Additional District Judge on the ground that 

the application for condonation of delay is silent qua any justiciable reasons, 

on  the  other  hand,  the  respondent  ex-wife  was  awarded  08  Tolas  of  Gold

jewelry,  which  is  part  and  parcel  of  Nikahnama.  However,  at  this  stage,  the 

petitioner  has  conceded  that  he  has  not  objected  to  the  maintenance  of  the 

minor  in  any  manner,  therefore,  the  same  was  upheld.  However,  he  is  only 

challenging  the  08  Tolas  of  gold  and  petitioner  has  been  confronted  to  the 

extent of 08 Tola Gold, which he conceded that the same has been mentioned 

in Column 17 of the  Nikahnama, whereas he  has  not  contested  the suit  at the 

relevant  time  nor  any  rebuttal  evidence  is  available  on  record,  in  such 

scenario,  his  plea  is  not  entertainable  before  the  High  Court.  The  factual 

aspects have already been appreciated by both the Courts below on the basis 

of  unrebutted  evidence  brought  on  record  by  the  respondent  ex-wife  Asia 

Mehboob,  therefore,  in  such  scenario,  High  Court  cannot  in  its  limited 

constitutional jurisdiction, interfere with concurrent findings of fact supported 

by evidence as held in 1980 SCMR 933 (Ghulam Muhammad and another VS 

Mst. Noor Bibi and 5 others). Even otherwise, the petitioner at the same time, 

filed  an  application  for  setting-aside  the  ex-parte  decree  before  the  Judge 

Family  Court  and  also  adopted  to  challenge  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the 

first  appellate  Court  and  now  raised  the  question  in  the  constitutional 

jurisdiction, in such scenario, the  doctrine of election also comes into play as 

held  in  PLD  2020  Islamabad  361  (Chairman,  National  Highway  Authority 

and another VS Messrs Moon Traders and another), PLD 2018 Supreme Court 

828  (Trading  Corporation  of  Pakistan  VS  Development  Sugar  Mills  Limited 

and  others),  2019  CLC  640  [Lahore  (Multan  Bench)]  (Muhammad  Boota  VS 

Judge Family Court and others), 2005 CLC 525 [Lahore] (Zafar and 2 others VS 

Ghulam Muhammad and 9 others). 

8. 

In  view  of  above  position,  the  factual  aspect  has  properly  been 

appreciated  by  the  Courts  below  and  concurrently  been  held  against  the 

petitioner  where  he  has  not  challenged  the  vires  of  maintenance  part  of  the 

 
 
W.P.No.3433/2021 and W.P. No.3451/2021

judgments  and  decree  and  conceded  the  claim  that  extent,  only  agitated  the 

matter  to  the  extent  of  08  Tola  Gold  against  whom,  nothing  is  available  on 

record,  adverse  to  the  respondent  claim,  therefore,  both  writ  petitions  are 

misconceived and same are hereby DISMISSED.
