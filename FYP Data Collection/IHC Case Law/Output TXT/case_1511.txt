Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

01.         08.01.2021.  Ch. Shafique Ahmad Ramay, Advocate for 

the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  prayed  for  decreasing  15% 

enhancement of the maintenance of minors to 

5%.  Order  for  15%  increase  was  passed  by 

the  learned  Family  Court,  Islamabad  vide 

judgment and decree dated 04.06.2009. 

 2. 

During  the  course  of  arguments, it 

transpired  that  the  impugned  judgment  was 

passed  on  04.06.2009  and  now  on 

05.01.2021  the  instant  petition  has  been 

filed,  the  instant  petition  badly  suffers  from 

laches.  Learned  counsel  contends  that  the 

amendment  was  made  in  Family  Law,  which 

clearly  states  that  there  should  be  only 

enhancement  upto  10%  per  annum  in  the 

maintenance  of  the  minors  but 

learned 

counsel  has  not  produced  any 

such 

amendment.  The  learned  counsel  seeks  time 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
to  assist  the  Court  on  the  point  of  limitation 

as  well  as  on  the  point  of  amendment  in 

Family  laws  regarding  the  enhancement  of 

10%  in  the  maintenance  of  the  minors  and 

further  to  assist  whether  any  application  has 

been  made  to  learned  Family  Court  on  the 

basis  of  said  amendment  or  otherwise. 

Request is allowed.

Re-list.
