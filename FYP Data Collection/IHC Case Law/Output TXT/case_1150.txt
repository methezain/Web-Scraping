Through  the  instant  bail  petition,  the 

petitioner seeks bail after arrest in case FIR 

No.  182/2020,  dated  08.07.2020,  offence 

under Sections 324, 427, 148, 149, 109 PPC, 

Cross Version under Sections 302, 324, 148, 

149,  337-F(ii),  337-F(v),  337-F(vi),  337-D, 

337-C  P.P.C  registered  at  Police  Station 

Shahzad Town, Islamabad.  

02.  On  08.07.2020,  FIR  No.  182/2020 

dated  08.07.2020  was  registered  on  the 

compliant  of  Syed  Shujat  Ali  Gillani  against 

the  accused  nominated  in  the  FIR  alleging 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

that  the  accused  party  has  attacked  on  the 

complainant  party  and  made  firing,  caused 

injuries  to  the  members  of  complainant 

party,  the  time  of  occurrence  is  shown  as 

06:00  p.m.  The  present  petitioner  namely 

Syed  Imran  Gillani  is  a  member  of  the 

complainant party of the FIR. 

03.  On  09.07.2020,  at  about  12:30  a.m. 

police  has  registered  a  report  as  cross 

version  on  the  compliant  of  Syed  Asad 

Hussain  Shah,  wherein  the  allegations  of 

firing  and  causing  injuries  etc.  against  the 

accused nominated in the cross version have 

been  leveled.  It  is  alleged  in  the  cross 

version  that  the  present  petitioner  while 

armed  with  pistol  30-bore  made  fire  shots, 

resultantly  Shahab  Shah  got  injured,  hence 

the  case  was  made  out  against  the  present 

petitioner in the cross version. 

04.  Learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  / 

accused  inter  alia  contends 

that 

the 

petitioner  has 

falsely  been 

implicated 

through  concocted  story 

in 

the  above 

mentioned  case  with  malafide  intention  by 

 
 
 
3 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

the  complainant;  he  is  a  law  abiding  citizen 

of  Pakistan  and  has  never  been  involved  in 

any 

criminal 

litigation; 

there 

is  no 

apprehension  of  his  abscondence  or 

tampering with the prosecution evidence; he 

was  arrested  on  30.09.2020;  it  is  a  case  of 

cross  version  which  establishes  that  attack 

was launched by the other side; the factum 

of wider net is clear from the contents of FIR 

where  the  complainant  has  not  spared  any 

member of family of the petitioner; contents 

of  police  report  itself  reveal  that  story  is 

concocted  one  and  is  not  truly  narrated  as 

per facts and there is a clear delay in lodging 

of  report.  Lastly,  learned  Counsel  for  the 

petitioner 

/  accused  has  prayed 

for 

acceptance of his bail petition.  

05.  Conversely, 

learned  State  Counsel 

assisted  by  the  learned  Counsel  for  the 

Complainant 

has 

controverted 

the 

arguments advanced by the learned Counsel 

for  the  petitioner  /  accused  and  has  stated 

that  petitioner  /  accused 

is  specifically 

nominated  in  the  cross  version;  recovery  of 

pistol  30-bore  has  been  effected  from  him; 

 
 
 
4 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

offences  fall  under  the  prohibitory  clause  of 

Section  497  Cr.P.C;  sufficient  incriminating 

evidence is available against the petitioner / 

accused, hence he is not entitled for grant of 

bail after arrest.  

06. 

I have heard the arguments advanced 

by 

learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner, 

learned  State  Counsel,  learned  Counsel  for 

the complainant and perused the record with 

their able assistance. 

07.  As per prosecution story, the petitioner 

made  firing  with  pistol  30-bore,  on  Shahab 

Shah,  Kamran  Shah,  co-accused  also  made 

firing  with  the  Kalashnikov  which  hit  both 

the  arms  of  the  Shahab  Shah  and  he  got 

injured.  However,  it  is  not  mentioned  that 

firing  made by  the  petitioner with pistol 30-

Bore  hit  on  which  part  of  the  body  of 

injured, Shahab Shah.  

08.  Medico Legal Report of Shahab Shah / 

injured reflects one entry and exit wound on 

the  left  arm  and  one  entry  wound  on  the 

right  arm,  no  other  injury  is  mentioned  on 

the  body  of  Shahab  Shah  /  injured  other 

 
 
 
5 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

than  aforementioned  two  injuries.  It  is 

categorically  mentioned  that  injuries  caused 

on  both  arms  of  the  injured  Shahab  Shah 

were  caused  by 

the  burst 

fire  with 

Kalashnikov  by  Kamran  Shah  /  accused 

nominated  in  the  cross  version.  There  is 

clear  conflict  between  ocular  account  and 

medical evidence. 

09. 

It  is  held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled  as 

“Muhammad Hanif VS Manzoor and 2 

others” (NLR 1981 SC 367) that: 

“It  is  true  that  at  the  stage  of 

deciding the question of bail, the 

court does not enter upon a detailed 

appreciation  and  examination  of 

evidence, but it is also clear that the 

question  cannot  be  decided  in 

vacuum and the court has to look at 

the material available when the bail 

is applied for. Now, in the present 

case,  result  of  medico-legal 

examination of the deceased was 

available and the learned Judge of 

High Court could not have refused 

to look at it.” 

The  same  law  has  been  laid  down  by  the 

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case 

 
 
 
6 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

titled  as  “Awal Khan and 7 others VS 

The  State  through  AG-KPK  and 

another” (2017 SCMR 538) that: 

“When the medical evidence is 

in  conflict  with  the  ocular 

account then, benefit of doubt 

at bail stage must go to the 

accused.” 

Reliance is also placed on the cases titled as 

“Khan Mir VS Amal Sher” (1989 SCMR 

1987) and  “Syed Khalid Hussain Shah 

VS The State” (2014 SCMR 12). 

10.  As  it  is  a  case  of  cross  version, 

question  of  aggression 

is  still 

to  be 

determined.  In  a  case  titled  as  “Sohaib 

Mehmood  Butt  VS  Iftikhar-ul-Haq” 

(1996 SCMR 1845),  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court  while  providing  guidelines  for  the 

exercise  of  jurisdiction  in  bail  matter  in  the 

cases  of  two  counter  versions  arising  from 

the same incident held as under;  

“Now what would constitute as 

sufficient  grounds  for  further 

inquiry  would  depend  on  the 

peculiar facts of each case and no 

hard and fast rule can be laid down 

for that purpose. Every hypothetical 

 
 
 
 
7 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

question  which  can  be  imagined 

would not make it a case of further 

inquiry simply for the reason that it 

can be answered by the trial Court 

subsequently  after  evaluation  of 

evidence.  Broadly  speaking,  the 

condition laid down in clause (2) of 

section 497, Cr.P.C. is that there are 

sufficient  grounds  for  further 

inquiry into his guilt which means 

that  the  question would  be  such 

which has nexus with the result of 

the case and may show or tend to 

show that accused is not guilt of the 

offence with which he charged. For 

example, if accused is charged for 

offence  under  section  302,  P.P.C. 

but there are grounds for further 

enquiry which may show that he 

may not be convicted of the charge 

under section 302, P.P.C. but may 

be  acquitted  or  convicted  for  a 

lesser offence.” 

  “In  the  counter-versions 

arising from the same incident, one 

given by complainant in F.I.R and 

the  other  given  by  the  opposite 

party  case-law  is  almost  settled 

that  such  cases  are  covered  for 

grant  of  bail  on  the  ground  of 

further  enquiry  as  contemplated 

under  section  497(2),  Cr.P.C.  In 

such cases normally, bail is granted 

on the ground of further enquiry 

for the reason that the question as 

to which version is correct is to be 

 
 
 
8 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

decided by the trial Court which is 

supposed to record evidence and 

also appraise the same in order to 

come to a final conclusion in this 

regard.  In  cases  of  counter-

versions, normally, plea of private 

defence  is  taken  giving  rise  to 

question  as  to  which  party  is 

aggressor  and  which  party  is 

aggressed”. 

Further  reliance  in  this  regard  can  also  be 

placed  on  the  case  titled  as  “Mehmood 

Akhtar  and  another  VS  Haji  Nazir 

Ahmad  and  4  others”  (1995  SCMR 

310).  

11. 

It  is  well  settled  principle  of  law  that 

while  deciding  the  bail  application,  before 

recording of evidence in the trial Court, only 

tentative  assessment  is  to  be  made  by  the 

Court  and  it  is  not  permissible  to  go  into 

details  of  evidence  in  one  way  or  the  other 

that might prejudice the case of either party. 

In  this  regard  reliance  is  placed  upon  cases 

reported  as  PLD 94 Supreme Court 65, 

PLD 94 Supreme Court 88, 2021 SCMR 

111 and 2020 SCMR 937. 

12. 

It is important to remember that bail is 

not to be withheld as a punishment. There is 

 
 
 
9 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

no  legal  or  moral  compulsion  to  keep  the 

people  in  jail  merely  on  the  allegation  that 

they  have  committed  offences  punishable 

with  death  or 

transportation,  unless 

reasonable  grounds  exist  to  disclose  their 

complicity.  The  ultimate  conviction  and 

incarceration  of  a  guilty  person  can  repair 

the wrong caused by a mistaken relief of bail 

after  arrest  granted 

to  him,  but  no 

satisfactory  reparation  can  be  offered  to  an 

innocent  man 

for 

his 

unjustified 

incarceration at any stage of the case albeit 

his  acquittal  in  the  long  run.  Reliance  is 

placed on a case titled as “Manzoor and 4 

others VS The State” (PLD 1972 SC 

81). 

13. 

It  is  held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court  in  a  case  titled  as “Zaigham Ashraf 

VS The State and others” (2016 SCMR 

18)  that: 

“To curtail the liberty of a person is 

a serious step in law, therefore, the 

Judges  shall  apply  judicial  mind 

with deep thought for reaching at a 

fair  and  proper  conclusion  albeit 

tentatively  however,  this  exercise 

 
 
 
10 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

shall  not  to  be  carried  out  in 

vacuum or in a flimsy and casual 

manner as that will defeat the ends 

of justice because if the accused 

charged, is ultimately acquitted at 

the  trial  then  no  reparation  or 

compensation  can  be  awarded  to 

him for the long incarceration, as 

the provisions of Criminal Procedure 

Code and the scheme of law on the 

subject  do  not  provide  for  such 

arrangements  to  repair  the  loss, 

caused  to  an  accused  person, 

detaining him in Jail without just 

cause and reasonable ground.” 

14. 

Investigation  in  the  case  has  been 

completed and the petitioner / accused is no 

more 

required 

for 

the  purpose  of 

investigation.  He  is  previously  non-convict 

and is behind the bars for the last more than 

11  months.  Trial  of  the  petitioner /  accused 

has  not  seen  any  fruitful  progress  as  yet, 

therefore,  his  further  incarceration  in  jail 

would not serve any purpose. 

15.  A 

tentative  assessment  of 

record 

shows  that  present  petitioner  has  made  out 

a case of further inquiry. 

 
 
 
11 

Crl. Misc. No. 813-B of 2021 

16. 

In  view  of  above,  instant  petition  is 

accepted  and  the  petitioner  is  admitted  to 

bail  subject  to  furnishing  bail  bonds  in  the 

sum  of  Rs.  500,000/-  (Five  Hundred 

Thousand)  with  two  sureties  each  in  the 

like  amount  to  the  satisfaction  of  learned 

trial Court. 

17.  Needless  to  mention  that,  this  is  a 

tentative  assessment  which  shall  not  affect 

the trial of case in any manner.
