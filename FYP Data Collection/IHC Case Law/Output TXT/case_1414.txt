W.P.No. 4015/2020 

Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Guardian  Court,  East  

Islamabad,  on  06.11.2020,  which  was  dismissed, 

vide  order  dated  14.11.2020,  on  the  ground  that 

the properties  of the deceased  in which the minor 

has  share  are  situated  beyond  the  territorial 

jurisdiction  of the court and in view of Section 16 

of the  Guardian  and  Wards  Act,  1890, the  Court 

within whose territorial jurisdiction  the property is 

situated  under the  law  is  competent  to  accept the 

applicant as duly appointed guardian of the minor 

or  declared  and  give  effect  to  such  order.  For 

ready  reference,  Section  16  of  Guardian  and 

Wards  Act, 1890 is  reproduced  herein  below  for 

ready reference:- 

"16.  Appointment  or  declaration  of guardian 
for  property  beyond jurisdiction  of the  Court. 
If the Court appoints or declares a guardian for 
any property  situate  beyond  the  local  limits  of 
its jurisdiction,  the Court having jurisdiction  in 
the place  where the property  is situate shall, on 
production  of  a  certified  copy  of  the  order 
appointing  or  declaring  the  guardian,  accept 
him  as  duly  appointed  or  declared  and  give 
effect to the order. ". 

4. 

As  per  Section  16  ibid,  if  the  petitioner, 

who  has  been  appointed  as  a  guardian  of  the 

minor  by  a  Guardian  Judge,  Islamabad,  through 

an  order,  in  respect  of  properties,  which  are 

situated  beyond  the  local  limits  of the  Islamabad 

i.e.  in  the  province  of Punjab,  may  produce  the 

certified  copy  of the  said  order  before  the  Court 

within whose territorial jurisdiction  the property is 

situated  and  that  very  Court  shall  accept him/her 

as  duly  appointed  guardian  or  declared  and  give 

effect 

to  such  order.  Therefore, 

I  am  m 

consonance  with  the  view  taken  by  the  learned 

Trial  Court  that  in  view  of the  clear  language  of 

section  16  of the  Guardian  and  Wards Act,  1890,

the  petitioner  can 

file  application 

seeking 

permission  to  sell  the  share/property  of  ward 

before  the  Court,  within  whose  local  limits  the 

property  is  situated  and  due  to  the  word  'shall' 

used  in  the  said  Section  16,  it  is mandatory upon 

such  court  to  accept  the  person  as  a  duly 

appointed guardian and give effect to the order of 

appointment  of  the  applicant  as  Guardian,  by 

allowing the requisite permission. 

5. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  the 

impugned  order  dated  14.11.2020,  passed  by 

learned  Guardian Judge,  Islamabad  is  declared to 

be lawful and justified  which does not suffer from 

any  illegality,  irregularity  or  infirmity  and  is 

hereby upheld. 

6. 

The  instant  writ  petition,  being  devoid  of 

any merit is  hereby dismissed.
