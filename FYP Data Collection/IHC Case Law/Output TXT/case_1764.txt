Order  with  signature  of Judge  and that  of parties  or  counsel  where 
necessary. 

Date of 
order/ 
Proceedings 
26.11.2019  Khawaja  Manzoor  Ahmed,  Advocate 

for 

the 

petitioner 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner,  Ammar  Hussain  Qazi,  impugns  the 

judgment  and decree  dated  15.10.2019 passed by 

the  Court  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  his  appeal  against  the  order 

dated  04.05.2019  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court was dismissed as not competent. Vide 

order  dated  04.05.2019, the  learned  Family Court 

had  struck  off  the  petitioner's  right  of  defence 

under  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Court Act, 1964 ("the 1964 Act"). 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  candidly 

admitted that the suit for  "dissolution of marriage on 

the  basis  khula, 

recovery  of  maintenance 

allowances, 

delivery 

expenses" 

filed 

by 

respondents No.1 and 2 against the petitioner  is still 

pending  adjudication  before  the  learned  Family 

Court. 

3. 

Learned counsel for  the  petitioner  submitted 

that  the  mandate  of  Section  17-A of  the  1964 Act 

was that after striking  off the defence of a party who 

does not comply with  the  order  for  payment of the 

interim  maintenance, the  suit  is  to  be  decreed  on 

the basis of averments made in the  plaint, whereas 

in the case at hand, the learned Family Court did not 

decree the suit;  and that  as regards  the petitioner, 

the  order  dated  04.05.2019 passed  by the  learned 

Family Court  was  a  final  order  for  all  intents  and 

2 

W.P.No.4068/2019 

purposes, and therefore  the  same was appealable. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  the 

writ  petition  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the  relief 

sought therein. 

4. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  have  perused  the 

record with his able assistance. 

5. 

Section 14(3) of the 1964 Act  expressly bars a 

right  of  appeal or  revision against  an interim  order 

passed  by  a  Family  Court.  A  party  aggrieved  by 

such  an  interim  order  has  to  wait  until  a  Family 

Court passes a final order  and then to challenge it in 

an appeal. This is because an interim order  merges 

into the final verdict.  The purpose behind barring an 

appeal or  a revision against an interim  order  of the 

Family Court  is  to  avoid  delays  in  disposal  of  the 

cases by the  Family Court.  Since the  suit  instituted 

by  respondents  No.1  and  2  is  for  dissolution  of 

marriage,  recovery  of  maintenance,  etc.,  the  final 

decree  that  may be  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court would be appealable under Section 14 

of  the  1964 Act.  In such  an  appeal,  the  petitioner 

can  also  challenge 

the 

interim  order  dated 

04.05.2019 passed by the  learned  Family Court.  In 

the case of Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi VS Province 

of  Sindh  (1996 SCMR 1165), it  has  been  inter  a/ia 

that  a party  affected  by an interim  order  passed by 

a Family Court has to wait  till  it  matures into a final 

order  and then to  attack  it  in the  proper  exclusive 

forum  created  for  the  purpose  of  examining such 

orders. 

6. 

Since the  order  passed  by  the  Family Court 

was  an  interim  order,  the  learned  Appellate  Court 

was  correct  in  dismissing  the  petitioner's  appeal 

against the said order  as not competent. The order 

dated 04.05.2019 was clearly interlocutory  in nature 

3 

W.P.No.4068/2019 

and did  not  dispose of  the  entire  case  before  the 

Family  Court.  The  concurrent  orders/judgments 

passed  by  the  learned  Courts  below  are  neither 

without jurisdiction  nor ma/afide,  void or  coram-non 

judice  so  as  to  warrant 

interference 

in  the 

Constitutional jurisdiction  of this Court under Article 

199 of the Constitution. 

7. 

Since  I  do  not  find  the  pre-requisites  for 

interference in the Constitutional jurisdiction  of this 

Court  with 

the 

impugned 

judgment  dated 

15.10.2019 to  be satisfied  in the case at hand, the 

instant  writ  petition  is  dismissed  in  limine.  The 

petitioner  will  be  at  liberty  to  challenge the  order 

dated  04.05.2019  passed  by  the  learned  Family 

Court in an appeal against the final order/judgment 

passed by  the  learned Judge  Family Court,  if  the 

occasion  arises  for  doing  so.  There  shall  be  no 

order  as to costs.
