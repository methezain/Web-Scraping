Mr. Karim  Nawaz Abbasi,  Advocate for petitioner

Through  this writ petition  the petitioner  has

assailed  the order  dated  22.07.2019,  passed by learned

Judge  Family Court,  Islamabad,  whereby interim
maintenance  was fixed @ Rs.10,000/  - per month for

each minor namely Saisha Zahoot, Esha Eman and

Zohreen  Zahoor.

2.  At the very outset, learned  counsel  for the

petitioner  contends that Family Court has already

passed the final decree.

3. 

Be that as it may, when the final decree has

already been passed by the Family Court (West),

Islamabad,  instant  writ petition has become  infructuous,

which is otherwise against the interlocutory  order of the
Family  Court. Hence,  instant  petition is  hereby

dismisseil  in limine  as having become  infructuous.
