Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

Main Case. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition 

filed  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution 

of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed  the  legality  and 

validity  of  order  and  decree  dated 

02.11.2019  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad  as  well  as 

judgment  and  decree  dated  23.12.2020 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge, West-Islamabad.  

02. 

Succinctly, 

stated 

the 

facts 

mentioned in the writ petition are that the 

respondents  No.  3  and  4  filed  a  suit  for 

„Recovery  of  Maintenance,  Dower  and 

Dowry  Articles‟  before 

learned  Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad  in  which  a 

preliminary decree to the extent of dowry 

articles  was  passed  on  27.03.2018  upon 

the voluntary statement of the petitioner / 

defendant.  Thereafter,  the  remaining  suit 

was  contested  by  the  petitioner  by  filing 

written statement on 28.05.2018. The pre-

trial reconciliation proceedings were failed 

 
 
 
 
  
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

on  29.10.2018  and  learned  Judge  Family 

Court fixed the interim maintenance of the 

minor  /  respondent  No.  4  @  Rs.  10,000/- 

per  month,  which 

the  petitioner 

is 

regularly paying till date.  

03.  After 

framing 

of 

issues 

on 

10.12.2018  matter  was  fixed  for  evidence 

of  the  respondent  No.  3  /  plaintiff  on 

12.01.2019  but  adjournment  was  sought 

on  behalf  of  respondent  No.  3  /  plaintiff. 

Affidavit  in  evidence  was  filed  by  the 

respondent  No.  3  on  25.09.2019  and  the 

matter  was  fixed  for  cross-examination 

upon  her  but  she  failed  to  appear  in  the 

witness box for cross examination, despite 

several  opportunities.  Resultantly,  on 

19.10.2019  last  opportunity  was  granted 

to  respondent  No.  3  for  completing  the 

evidence and in case of failure, closure of 

right on 02.11.2019. 

04.  On  02.11.2019,  respondent  No.  2 

without 

recording 

the 

„consenting 

statement‟  of  the  petitioner  and  without 

any 

„written  settlement‟  between 

the 

 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

parties  or  „any  application‟  in  lieu  of 

request, recorded the so called settlement, 

passed the impugned order and decree on 

the  basis  of  so  called  settlement  which  is 

illegal,  arbitrary,  without  due  process  of 

law and while prejudicing the fundamental 

rights of the petitioner, guaranteed by the 

Constitution of Pakistan, 1973. Thereafter, 

petitioner  preferred  an  appeal  against  the 

impugned  order  and  decree  dated 

02.11.2019  passed  by  respondent  No.  2. 

The  same  was  dismissed  vide  judgment 

and  decree  dated  23.12.2020  passed  by 

respondent  No.  1.  Being  aggrieved  of  the 

order  and  decree  dated  02.11.2019  along 

with  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 

23.12.2020,  the  petitioner  has  filed  the 

instant writ petition.    

05. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter  alia  contends  that  the  impugned 

order  dated  02.11.2019  passed  by  the 

learned 

Judge  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad  /  respondent  No.  2,  is  against 

the  law  and  facts,  illegal,  perverse,  void 

 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

ab-initio and is result of exercise of power 

not  so  vested;  the  same  is  based  on 

material  irregularity  and  illegality  floating 

on  the  surface  of  record,  both  the 

impugned  judgment  and  order  have  been 

passed  against  the  dictums  laid  down  by 

superior  Courts  of  the  country.  Learned 

counsel  has  further  contended  that  the 

impugned  order  and  decree  dated 

02.11.2019  has  imposed  those  liabilities 

upon  the  petitioner  which  he  is  incapable 

to  discharge,  hence 

the  same  has 

prejudiced  the  right  to  life  and  liberty  of 

the petitioner as enshrined under Article 9 

of  the  Constitution  of  Pakistan,  1973;  the 

procedure  adopted  by  respondent  No.  2 

while  affecting  the  so  called  settlement 

was  arbitrary, 

illegal  and  not 

in 

accordance  with  law  on  the  subject;  the 

right of fair trial and due process has been 

violated  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court;  no  consent  of  the  petitioner  was 

secured by respondent No. 2 to affect the 

so  called  settlement  rather  signatures  on 

 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

the margins of the blank order sheet were 

affixed  upon  the  directions  of  the  Judge 

Family Court / respondent No. 2, the said 

fact can be proved by the CCTV footage of 

the  concerned  Court;  the  Judge  Family 

Court has acted  arbitrarily, illegally and in 

a  hasty  manner  while  exercising  the 

powers not vested in it and dictated the so 

called settlement at its own which was not 

in the domain of learned Family Court; the 

impugned 

judgment  and  order  are 

discriminatory  against  the  petitioner  while 

over-burdening  him,  without  considering 

the  capacity  and  without  any  material  / 

evidence  available  on  record  and  has 

prayed  that  both  the  judgment  and  order 

dated  23.12.2020  and  02.11.2019  passed 

by  learned  Additional  District  Judge  / 

respondent  No.  1  and  learned  Judge 

Family  Court 

/ 

respondent  No.  2, 

respectively are liable to be set-aside. 

06.  Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents  No.  3  &  4  has  controverted 

the  arguments  made  by  learned  counsel 

 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

for  the  petitioner  and  has  stated  that  on 

02.11.2019,  matter  was  settled  between 

the  parties;  both  the  parties  affixed  their 

signatures  and  thumb  impressions  on  the 

order  sheet;  learned  counsel  for  both  the 

parties  have  also  affixed  their  signatures 

and  the  order  dated  02.11.2019  was 

passed  with  consent  of  both  the  parties 

present  before  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court  and  has  prayed  for  dismissal  of 

instant writ petition 

07.  Arguments  advanced  by  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  learned 

counsel  for  the  respondents  No.  3  &  4 

have  been  heard  and  the  documents, 

placed  on  record  have  been  examined 

with their able assistance. 

08.  Order 

sheet  dated  02.11.2019 

categorically shows that the petitioner and 

respondent  No.  3  /  ex-wife  of 

the 

petitioner  affixed  their  signatures  and 

thumb  impressions  on  the  order  sheet. 

Learned counsel for both the parties have 

also  affixed  their  signatures  and  it  was 

 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

mentioned  in  the  order  that  the  matter 

has  been  settled  between  the  parties, 

wherein the terms are mentioned in detail 

regarding  the  payment  of  maintenance, 

dower amount, visitation schedule etc.. On 

the  basis  of  settlement  between  the 

parties, 

order 

and 

decree 

dated 

02.11.2019  was  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge Family Court, Islamabad and on the 

basis  of  the  consenting  impugned  order 

and  decree  passed  by  the  Judge  Family 

Court,  the  appeal  of  the  petitioner  was 

dismissed  by 

the  Court  of 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge-West,  Islamabad 

vide 

Judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

23.12.2020.  

09.  As  far  as  the  arguments  of  learned 

counsel for the petitioner that the learned 

Judge 

Family  Court 

obtained 

the 

signatures  of  the  parties  on  the  blank 

order  sheet  and  subsequently  passed  the 

order  without  their  consent,  the  alleged 

act of the Judge Family Court amounts to 

mis-conduct.  When  the  learned  counsel 

 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

for the petitioner was confronted, whether 

the  petitioner  has  filed  any  complaint 

against the Judge Family Court before the 

Hon‟ble Chief Justice of this Court, learned 

Member  Inspection  Team  or  District  and 

Sessions 

Judge 

that 

order 

dated 

02.11.2019  was  not  passed  with  the 

mutual  consent  of 

the  parties  and 

signatures  /  thumb 

impressions  were 

obtained  on  a  blank  paper, 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  denied  and 

stated  that  no  such  complaint  was  ever 

filed  against  the  Judge  Family  Court, 

Islamabad,  West-Islamabad 

by 

the 

petitioner.  

10. 

Presumption  of  truth  is  attached  to 

the  judicial  proceeding  and  according  to 

record of the learned Trial Court impugned 

order  and  decree  was  passed  with  the 

consent of the parties. 

11.  As  this  Court  is  the  Court  of  equity 

and  Petitioner  for  equitable  relief  was 

supposed  to  put-forth  some  convincing 

 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

materials  which would  have  justified  filing 

of the instant writ petition. 

12. 

Inference  can  be  drawn 

from 

Section  96(3)  of  the  C.P.C.  For  ease  of 

reference it is produced below: 

“96.  Appeal 

from 

original 

decree.--- 

-------------------------------------  

(3)  No  appeal  shall  lie  from  a 

decree  passed  by  the  Court 

with the consent of parties.” 

A  perusal  of  this  provision  reveals  that 

consent decrees are not appealable. 

13. 

It  is  trite  that  in  order  to  get 

discretionary  and  equitable  relief,  the 

parties should approach to the Courts with 

clean hands. Reference in this regard may 

be made to the following case laws:- 

(i) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

“Shafqatullah  and  others  VS 

District  and  Sessions  Judge, 

Nowshera,  N.W.F.P  and  4 

others” (2001 SCMR 274), it has 

been held as follows:- 

 
 
  
11 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

“It would also appear from 

the  record  that  the 

petitioners 

did 

not 

approach  the  High  Court 

with clean hands entitling 

them to the discretionary, 

equitable  relief  under  the 

Constitutional jurisdiction”. 

(ii) 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Manzoor 

Hussain  and  3  others  VS 

Muhammad  Siddique”  (2000 

CLC 623 [Lahore]), it  has  been 

held as follows:- 

“The  grant  or  refusal  of 

declaration  is  essentially 

discretionary  and  in  this 

case,  to  my  mind,  the 

plaintiff  had  forfeited  his 

right to an equitable relief 

by putting up a false case”. 

The  same  principle  has  been  laid  down  in 

cases  titled  as  “Shahnaz  Parveen  and 

another VS Javed Yaqoob and other” 

(2020  MLD  638  [Islamabad])  and 

“University of the Punjab and another 

VS Malik Jehangir Khan” (1994 PLC(CS) 

314 [Lahore]). 

 
 
 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

14. 

Further, 

there  are 

concurrent 

findings of  both  the  learned  Courts  below 

against 

the  petitioner. 

In  case  of 

concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below, 

scope  of 

the  constitutional  petition 

becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner  has 

failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading  of  the  evidence.  It  has  been  laid 

down  in  a  case  titled  as  “Syed Arif Ali 

Sabri VS Abdul Samad through L.Rs. 

and 2 others” (2008 YLR 2309)” that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

interfered when the orders of the 

Courts below are fanciful or based 

on misreading or non-reading of 

the evidence".  The  same  view  has 

also  been  taken  in  a  case  titled  as 

“Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad Ali 

and  others”  (PLD  2008  Karachi 

2005). 

15. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is 

only available  to quash  a  decision  for  an 

error  of  law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for 

correcting  errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an 

 
 
 
 
13 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

inferior  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction, 

or  fails  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  or 

where  the  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts 

illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a  matter  in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice.  The  High  Court  while  issuing  a 

writ  of  certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction. The High Court in exercise of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court  or  a  tribunal.  Reliance  may  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan  VS  Muhammad  Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle  of  law  that  the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

 
 
 
14 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

in order to interfere with 

the discretion exercised by 

lower  courts  unless  the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has  been  passed  without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence, or is  not  in 

accordance with the law. If 

none  of  these  errors  is 

present,  the  High  Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

a different conclusion as to 

the  controversy  than  the 

latter.  In  this  regard, 

reference can be made to a 

collective reading of Mst. 

Mobin 

Fatima 

v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad 

(1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii)  In  a  case  titled  as "President 

All 

Pakistan  Women 

 
 
15 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt 

VS  Muhammad  Akbar  Awan 

and others” (2020 SCMR 260), 

it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It is settled law that when 

the  Statute  does  not 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

same cannot be challenged 

by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court in order 

to gain a similar objective. 

Where  a  Statute  has 

expressly barred a remedy 

which is not available to a 

party under the Statute, it 

cannot be sought indirectly 

by 

resort 

to 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court. The High 

Courts 

exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

advancing the policy of law 

and delivering expeditious 

justice in accordance with 

the 

law  and 

the 

Constitution. 

Even 

 
 
 
16 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and discretionary in nature 

and  should  not  be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass  the  purpose  of  a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it  is 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"Where  the  Court  or  the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such determination cannot 

ordinarily  be  interfered 

with  by  the  High  Court 

while 

exercising 

jurisdiction  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution."  

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it is 

 
 
 
17 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate court/Tribunal 

in a fair and just manner 

without  violating  or 

disregarding 

statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned Judges of the High 

Court for future course of 

action:  (i)  Brig.  (Rtd.) 

Imtiaz 

Ahmed 

v. 

Government  of  Pakistan, 

through Secretary, Interior 

Division, Islamabad (1994 

SCMR 2142), (ii) Shahnaz 

Begum  v.  The  Hon'ble 

 
 
18 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

Judges of the High Court of 

Sindh  and  Balochistan 

(PLD 1971 SC 677),  (iii) 

Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar v. 

Ghulam  Qasim  Khan 

Khakwani  (PLD  1994  SC 

281).  

(v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam VS Muhammad Siddique 

and 2 others” (PLD 2007 SC 

45),  it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court that: 

"The High Court in exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional 

jurisdiction 

is 

not 

supposed  to  interfere  in 

the  findings  on  the 

controversial  question  of 

facts  based  on  evidence 

even  if  such  finding  is 

erroneous.  The  scope  of 

the judicial review of the 

High  Court  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution in 

such  cases,  is  limited  to 

the extent of misreading or 

non-reading of evidence or 

if the finding is based on 

no  evidence  which  may 

cause  miscarriage  of 

justice but it is not proper 

for  the  High  Court  to 

disturb the finding of fact 

 
 
19 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

through  reappraisal  of 

evidence 

in 

writ 

jurisdiction or exercise this 

jurisdiction as a substitute 

of revision or appeal”. 

16. 

Status  of 

impugned  order  and 

decree was that of consent decree, which 

was not appealable, no illegality as well as 

jurisdictional  error  was  pointed  out  in  the 

impugned  order  and  judgment  warranting 

interference by the High Court in exercise 

of extra ordinary constitutional jurisdiction. 

Reliance  is place  upon  the  cases  reported 

as 2021 SCMR 431, PLD 2007 SC 343, 

1989 SCMR 1826, 2017 CLC Note 55 

and 2002 CLD 1761.  

17. 

For what has been discussed above, 

the  order  and  decree  dated  02.11.2019 

passed by the learned Judge Family Court, 

West-Islamabad  as  well  as  judgment  and 

decree  dated  23.12.2020  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West-

Islamabad are in accordance with law and 

facts of the matter and do not require any 

interference  by 

this  Court.  The  writ 

petition 

is  not  maintainable,  hence 

 
 
 
20 

Writ Petition No. 206  of 2021 

dismissed  being  meritless  with  no  order 

as to costs.
