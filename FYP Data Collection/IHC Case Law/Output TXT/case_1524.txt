I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the

have  perused  the record  with their  able assistance. 

58.  The  facts  leading  to  the  filing of the instant petitions have been 

set  out  in  sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  2  to  38  above  and  need  not 

be recapitulated. 

WHETHER  A  DEPUTATIONIST  HAS  A  VESTED  RIGHT  TO 
COMPLETE THE DEPUTATION PERIOD :-  

59.  It 

is  settled 

law  that  a  deputationist  may  not  necessarily 

complete  the  tenure  for  which  he/she  was  sent  on  deputation  and 

that  power  vests  with  the  competent  authority  to  repatriate  a 

deputationist  without  assigning  any  reason.  In  case  of  transfer  on 

deputation,  no  vested  right  accrues  to  a  deputationist  to  continue 

for  the  period  of  deputation.  The  competent  authority  is  empowered 

to  repatriate  a  deputationist  as  and  when  the  exigencies  of  service 

require.  Some  of  the  cases  in  which  this  view  has  been  taken  are 

mentioned  herein  below:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Pakistan  VS  Fazal  Rehman  Khundkar  (PLD  1959 

Supreme  Court  (Pak.)  82),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  it  is  a  matter  of  practice  and 

common  experience,  that  officers  of  the  Provincial  cadres 

deputed  for  service  at  the  Centre  are  frequently  recalled  by 

their  Province,  by  the  Provincial  Government,  in  the  exigencies 

of  the  public  service.  Against  such  a  recall,  they  have  no  right 

of  any  kind  to  object  being  substantively  officers  of  the 

Provincial  Government  and  only  on  deputation  to  the  Centre. 

The  mere  fact  that  they  may  be  holding  at  the  Centre  a  post 

higher  in  rank  than  that  to  which  their  place  in  the  Provincial 

cadre  entitles  them 

in  the  Provincial  service  does  not 

constitute  the  least  bar  to  the  making  of  an  order  by  the 

Central  Government  at 

the 

request  of 

the  Provincial 

Government,  re-placing  the  services  of  such  an  officer  at  the 

disposal of his parent  Government.

W.P.Nos.980,  1123,  1317,  1383,  1427,  1800, 
 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Dr.  Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  VS  CDA,  Islamabad 

(2010  SCMR  378),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan  that  the  provisions  of  the  1973  Rules  and 

rules  made  thereunder  as  well  as  Esta  Code  were  silent  about 

the  fact  that  a  deputationist  must  serve  his  entire  period  of 

deputation  and  such  omission  seemed  deliberate  enabling  the 

competent  authority  to  utilize  services  of  an  employee  in  the 

manner  as  it  might  deem  fit  and  proper.  Period  of  deputation 

could  at  the  best  be  equated  to  that  of  an  expression  of 

maximum  period  which  could  be  curtailed  or  extended  by 

competent  authority  and  no 

legal  or  vested  rights  were 

available  to  a  deputationist  to  serve  his  entire  period  of 

deputation  in borrowing  department.   

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Mst.  Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan 

(2013  PLC  (C.S.)  915),  it  has  been  held  by  this  Court  that  a 

deputationist  cannot  remain  on  deputation  for  an  indefinite 

period  or  stipulated  period  in  accordance  with  his/her  own 

whims  and  wishes.  Civil  servant  has  no  vested  right  to 

complete  the  deputation  period  as  it  is  a  matter  relating  to  the 

terms  and  conditions  of  service.  The  competent  authority  of 

borrowing  department,  having  the  sole  discretion  to  decide 

the  fate  of  a  deputationist,  could  repatriate  him/her  at  any time 

to parent  department.   

(iv) 

In  case  of  Abdul  Majeed  VS  Chief  Secretary, Punjab (2015 PLC 

(C.S.)  1381),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble Lahore High Court 

that  a  deputationist  did  not  have  any  vested  right  to  remain  on 

the  post  as  deputationist  forever  or  for  a  stipulated  period.  A 

deputationist  could  be  ordered  to  be  repatriated  to  his  parent 

department  at  any  time  without  assigning  any  reason.  Parent 

department  of  appellant-employee  was  not  bound  to  assign 

reason  for his repatriation.   

(v) 

In  case  of  Lal  Khan  VS  Employees  Old  Age  Benefit  Institution 

(2010PLC  (C.S.)1377),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court  of  Sindh  that  a  deputationist  had  no  vested  right  to 

remain  on  post 

forever  or 

for  a  stipulated  period.  A 

deputationist  could  not  challenge  order  of  his  repatriation  as 

he could be repatriated  to parent  department  at any  time.

 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

60.  On  account  of  the  above  referred  trite  law,  the  petitioners 

could  not  have  any  grievance  against  their  repatriation  by  the 

borrowing  department  to  their  respective  parent  departments.  At  no 

material  stage,  had  the  petitioners  been  absorbed  in  the  borrowing 

department.  The  petitioners  could  not  have 

invoked 

the 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  to  prevent  their  repatriation 

to  their  parent  departments.  The  law  in  this  regard  is  also  well 

settled. 

In  the  case  of  Dr.  Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  VS  CDA, 

Islamabad  (2010  SCMR  378),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  a  deputationist  cannot  be  treated  as 

an  „aggrieved  person‟  because  he/she  has  no  vested  right  to  remain 

on  a  post  as  deputationist  forever  or  to  complete  his/her  deputation 

period and can be repatriated  at any  time.  

WHETHER A DEPUTATIONIST HAS A VESTED RIGHT TO CONTINUE 
SERVING AS SUCH UNTIL HIS/HER SPOUSE IS EMPLOYED AT THE 
STATION WHERE THE BORROWING DEPARTMENT IS LOCATED :-  

61.  Another  question  that  needs  to  be  determined  is  whether  a 

person  posted  on  deputation  at  a  particular  station  can  claim  to 

remain  so  posted  for  all  the  period  during  which  his  or  her  spouse 

remains  employed  at  such  a  station.  It  is  indeed  not  pleasant  for  a 

husband  and  wife  to  be  working  at  different  stations  but  the  law 

cannot  be  circumvented  to  bring  them  to the same station. To hold in 

favour  of  such  a  deputationist  would  be  tantamount  to  disregarding 

the  innumerable  authorities  from  the  Superior  Courts  holding  that  no 

legal  or  vested  rights  were  available  to  a  deputationist  to serve as in 

the  borrowing  department  for  an  indefinite  period.  In  the  case  of 

Mst.  Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan,  (2013 PLC (CS) 915), the 

petitioner  had  challenged  the  repatriation  to  the  parent  department 

on  the  ground  that  it  was  contrary  to  inter alia  the  wedlock  policy. 

The  petitioner  in  that  case  had  also  prayed  for  a  direction  to  the 

borrowing  department  to  absorb  her.  This  Court  dismissed  the  writ 

petition  by  inter alia  holding  that  the  petitioner's  claim  on  the  basis 

of  the  wedlock  policy  was  not  justifiable.  Furthermore, it was held as 

follows:-  

"10. The law on the subject is very much clear. The petitioner is a 
civil servant and remained on deputation for a fixed term and was 
returned to her parent department in consequence of terms and 
conditions of her deputation. A deputationist cannot remain on 
deputation  for  an  indefinite  period  or  stipulated  period  in

 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

accordance with his/her own whims and wishes. While taking this 
view, I am fortified by a judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex 
Court in the case of Dr. Shafi-ur-Rehman Afridi v. CDA Islamabad 
through Chairman and others (2010 SCMR 378)." 

62.  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  Asma  Shaheen  VS  Federation  of 

Pakistan  (2013  PLC  (C.S.)  391,  this  Court  spurned  the  plea  that  a 

deputationist  cannot  be  repatriated  due  to  the  wedlock  policy.  At 

paragraph  13 of the said judgment,  it has been  held as follows:-  

“13. From the plain reading of above said wedlock policy, it is 
obvious that the word "may" has been used in the said letters and 
not "shall". It has never been stressed that all the deputationists 
whose spouses are working at Islamabad shall must be absorbed or 
will continue to serve at Islamabad. As regards the contention that 
some of deputationists have been absorbed, the same cannot be 
taken into consideration, for the simple reason that it was the 
discretion  of  the  competent  authority  to  absorb  some  of 
deputationists  according  to  requirement  of  department, 
capabilities,  know  how,  performance,  qualification,  general 
reputation and on the basis of annual confidential reports. The 
others cannot claim the same treatment as of right. The deputation 
is a contract and if borrowing department does not need the 
services of a deputationist, he or she must go back to parent 
department and thus no fundamental rights of the petitioners have 
been infringed and no provisions of Constitution have been violated. 
Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  have  failed  to rebut the 
contention of learned Deputy Attorney-General that at present no 
deputationist is being absorbed. There appears no political element 
with  regard  to  repatriation  of  the  petitioners  to  their parent 
departments.”  

63.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  that  by  virtue  of  the  proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  1973 

Rules, 

the  petitioners 

is  entitled 

to  continue  serving  as  a 

deputationists  until  their  husbands  are  gainfully  employed 

in 

Islamabad,  it  may  be  noted  that  the  said  proviso  exempts  the 

application  of  Rule  20A  of  the  said  Rules  to  posting  of  (i)  serving 

husband  and  wife  at  the  same  station,  (ii)  unmarried  female 

government  servants  at 

the  place  of 

residence  of 

their 

parents/family,  and  (iii)  married  female  government  servants  at  the 

place  of  residence/posting  of  their  husbands  who  are  not 

in 

government  employment.  Rule  20A  of  the  said  Rules  sets  out  the 

eligibility  for  appointment  on  deputation  and the maximum period for 

which  an  appointment  on  deputation  can  be  made.  Therefore,  by 

virtue  of  the  said  proviso,  the  maximum  period  for  appointment  on 

deputation  may  not  apply  to  the  three  categories  of persons  referred 

to  in  the  proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  1973  Rules.  The  said  proviso

W.P.Nos.980,  1123,  1317,  1383,  1427,  1800, 
 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

cannot  be  interpreted  such  as  to  provide  for  an  indefinite  period  for 

an  appointment  on  deputation  or  to  give  a  deputationist  a  right  to 

remain  on  deputation  until  retirement.  The  said  proviso  cannot  come 

to  the  aid  of  a  deputationist  where  N.O.C.  for  an  extension  in  the 

deputation  period  is  not  given  by  the  parent  department  or  where 

the  borrowing  department  is  unwilling  to  extend  the  deputation 

period.  By 

issuing  repatriation  orders,  the  F.D.E.  (borrowing 

department)  has  expressed 

its  unwillingness 

to  extend 

the 

petitioners‟  deputation  period.  

WHETHER  THE  PETITIONERS  HAVE  A  VESTED  RIGHT  TO  BE 
ABSORBED IN THE F.D.E. (BORROWING DEPARTMENT) :-  

64.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  that  the  petitioners  have  a  right  to  be  absorbed  in  the 

F.D.E.  on  the  basis  of  the  Prime  Minister‟s  decision  reflected  in  the 

C.A.&D.D.‟s  letter  dated  11.11.2014,  suffice  it  to  say  that  for  the 

absorption  or  confirmation  of  any  deputationist  in  the  borrowing 

department,  the  ESTA  CODE  prescribes  a  procedure.  Till  date 

formal  orders  for  the  petitioners‟  absorption  have  not  been  passed. 

The  Establishment  Division‟s  Office  Memorandum  No.1(28)/75-D.II, 

dated  06.03.1975,  provides  that  where  there  is  an  intention  to 

permanently  absorb  a  deputationist  in  the  cadre  or  department 

where  he  is  serving  on  deputation  and  the  recruitment  rules  for  the 

post  provide  for  such  a  course,  in  such  cases  the  consent  of  the 

deputationist  to  the  suspension  or  termination  of 

lien  on  his 

permanent  post  in  the  parent  department  as  well  as  the  agreement 

of  the  parent  department  should  be  obtained.  With  the  completion of 

these  formalities,  the  deputationist  will  be  treated  as  a  regular 

member  of  the  establishment  of  the  borrowing  department.  As  early 

as  1952,  it  was  stated  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance‟s  letter  No.600-

RIII/52,  dated  06.03.1952  that  permanent  officers  belonging  to  a 

Department  or  Government,  while  on  deputation 

to  another 

Department  or  Government,  should  not  be  confirmed  in  the  latter 

without  the  prior  formal  concurrence  of  the  former  and  the  consent 

of  the  officer  concerned.  This 

instruction  has  been  formally 

recognized 

in  the  Establishment  Division‟s  Office  Memorandum 

No.8/7/64-  F.I,  dated  19.10.1964.  The  absorption  of  a  deputationist 

made in derogation  of the said policy would be shorn  of legality.   

 
 
19 

W.P.Nos.980,  1123,  1317,  1383,  1427,  1800, 
 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

65.  At  no  material  stage  has 

the  petitioners‟  borrowing 

department  sought 

the 

formal  concurrence  of 

the  parent 

departments  for  their  absorption  during  the  permissible  deputation 

period.  Since  the  very  process  for  the  petitioners‟  absorption  has 

not  been 

initiated  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  law,  the 

petitioners‟  desire  for  absorption  in  the  borrowing  department  is  not 

a  valid  ground  for  assailing  the  repatriation  orders.  In  case  of 

Senate  Secretariat  VS  Faiqa  Abdul  Hayee  (2014  SCMR  522),  it  has 

been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  absorption 

was  not  a  vested  right  of  an  employee  and  the  employer  had  the 

right  and  authority  to  terminate  the  deputation  period  or  repatriate 

the  employee  back  to  his/her  parent  department.  In  case  of  Mst. 

Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (supra),  it  has  been  held  by 

this  Court  that  a  deputation  being  a  contract,  a  deputationist  would 

have  no  vested  right  to  remain/continue  on  deputation  or  his 

permanent  absorption.   

66.  A  deputation 

is  an  administrative  agreement  between 

borrowing  and  lending  authorities  for  utilizing  the  services  of  an 

employee  in  the  public  interest  and  exigency  of  services  against  a 

particular  post  against  which  the  deputationists  cannot  claim  any 

right  of  permanent  absorption.  In  case  of  Rasheed  Tareen  VS 

Chairman  Works  Welfare  Board  (2012  PLC  (C.S.)  54),  it  has  been 

held  by  the  Hon'ble  Balochistan  High  Court  that  a  deputationist 

through  Constitutional  petition  could  not  claim  permanent 

absorption  in  borrowing  department  as  it  was  the  prerogative  of 

borrowing  department 

to  determine 

tenure  of  deputation 

to 

revert/return  a  deputationist  or 

to  absorb  a  deputationist 

permanently. 

It  was  also  held 

that  due 

to 

the  borrowing 

department‟s  refusal  for  the  petitioner's  permanent  absorption,  the 

petitioner  could not  be termed  as an aggrieved  person. 

67.  The  petitioners  in  writ  petitions  No.1317,  1383,  1427,  1958  and 

2264  of  2020  and  petitioners  No.2,  4  and  5 

in  writ  petition 

No.1800/2020  have  brought  on  record  the  letters  dated  17.08.2016, 

23.01.2020, 

23.11.2017, 

25.02.2020, 

05.10.2020, 

28.01.2020, 

20.09.2019  and  24.01.2020 

from 

their 

respective  parent 

departments  according  to  which  the  borrowing  department  (F.D.E.) 

has  been  requested  to  accept  /  absorb  their  services  on  permanent 

 
 
20 

W.P.Nos.980,  1123,  1317,  1383,  1427,  1800, 
 1865,  1958,  2241  2253,  2264  & 2504  of 2020, 

basis.  These  letters  do  not  come  to the said petitioners' aid since the 

borrowing  department  (F.D.E.)  had  not  initiated  any  process  for  the 

petitioners'  absorption.  The  said  letters  were  sent  by  the  petitioners' 

parent  departments  gratuitously  and  not  on  the  request  of  the 

borrowing  department  (F.D.E.).   

68.  As  regards  petitioner  No.1  (Ms.  Najmul  Sadain)  in  writ  petition 

No.1800/2020,  reliance  was  placed  on 

the  notification  dated 

17.08.2016  and 

letter  dated  30.09.2019 

issued  by  her  parent 

department  according  to  which  petitioner  No.1's  services  had  been 

placed  at  the  disposal  of  the  borrowing  department  (F.D.E.)  on 

"permanent  basis"  with  no  right  of  lien  to  be  retained  in  the  parent 

department.  At  no  material  stage  was  any  process 

for  the 

absorption  of  the  said  petitioners  in  the  borrowing  department 

(F.D.E.)  being  initiated  by  the  F.D.E.  The  said  notification  and  letter 

on  which  reliance  had  been  placed  do  not  take petitioner No.1 out of 

the  meaning  of  a  "deputationist".  A  deputationist  retains  a  right  of 

lien 

in  his/her  parent  department  unless  and  until  he/she 

is 

permanently  absorbed  in  the  borrowing  departments  by  following 

the procedure  prescribed  by law.  

69. 

In  view  of  the  above,  I  find  writ  petitions  No.980,  1123,  1317, 

1383,  1427,  1865,  1958,  2241,  2253,  2264,  2504  of  2020  and  writ 

petition  No.1800/2020  to  the  extent  of  petitioners  No.1,  2,  4  and  5,  to 

be  without  merit  and  the  same  are  accordingly  dismissed  with  no 

order  as to costs.
