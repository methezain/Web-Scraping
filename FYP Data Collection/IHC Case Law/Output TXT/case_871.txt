aggrieved  the  petitioner  filed  an  appeal  which 

was dismissed; writ petition for setting aside of 

the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  was  filed 

which  was  dismissed  by  this  Court  vide  order 

dated  21.01.2019;  Civil  Petition  filed  in  the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  was  also

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

04. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner inter 

alia  states  that  as  per  Section  60  of  Code  of 

Civil Procedure, 1908 whole salary of judgment 

debtor  cannot  be  attached;  the  petitioner  has 

no  other  source  of  income;  while  passing  the 

impugned  order/judgment,  both  the  learned 

courts below have not considered the dictums 

laid down by Hon’ble Superior Courts and have 

passed the same in a hasty manner; both the 

decisions  of  learned  Courts  below  are  against 

the  law  and  facts  and  hence  are  liable  to  be 

set aside.  

05. 

Learned counsel for respondents No.3 & 

4  controverted 

the  arguments  made  by 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  stated 

that  both  the  impugned  order/judgment  have 

been  passed  in  accordance  with  law;  after 

passing  the  decree,  the  petitioner  /  judgment 

debtor  has  not  paid  single  penny  till  the 

attachment of his salary; instant writ petition is 

barred  by  the  principle  of  laches;  petition  has 

been  filed  by  concealment  of  facts  as  the 

petitioner  has  not  mentioned 

the  earlier 

decisions  passed  by  this  Court  and  Hon’ble 

 
 
4 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

Supreme Court of Pakistan and has prayed for 

dismissal of the instant writ petition.  

06.  Arguments 

advanced 

by 

learned 

Counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

record  has  been  perused  with  their  able 

assistance. 

07. 

Judgment  and  decree  was  passed  by 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge  /  Guardian  Judge  / 

Family  Court-East,  Islamabad  on  17.07.2018, 

whereby 

following  relief  was  granted 

to 

respondents No.3 & 4:  

“Relief: 

In  light  of  issue  wise  finding  the 

plaintiff  No.1  is  held  entitled  for 

recovery 

of 

maintenance 

allowance 

for  herself  @  Rs. 

20,000/-  per  month  from  April 

2009  till  the  period  of  iddat  with 

15% 

annual 

increase.  The 

plaintiff  No.2  is  also  entitled  for 

the  maintenance  of  Rs.20,000/- 

per month since birth till the age 

of  18  years  subject  to  15% 

annual  increase.  The  defendant 

shall  made  arrangement 

for 

admission  of  the  minor  in  best 

school  in  the  town  on  panel  of 

PAEC,  otherwise,  he  shall  be 

bound 

to  pay 

the  education 

expenses of the minor in addition 

to  maintenance  as  decreed 

 
 
  
 
5 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

above.  Defendant  shall  also  be 

liable  to  pay  education  expenses 

of plaintiff No.2 as incurred so far 

by  the  plaintiff  No.1  including 

admission  fee,  monthly  fee  and 

expenses  of  stationary  only.  The 

defendant  shall  also  pay  pre  and 

post 

birth 

expenses 

as 

Rs.67,000/- 

and  Rs.80,800/- 

respectively.  The  plaintiff  will  be 

entitled  to  recover  09  tola  gold 

from  the  defendant  or  value  at 

the  existing  market  rate.  The

15,000/- 

to 

the  plaintiff  as 

remaining  dower  amount.  No 

order  as

consigned  to  record  room  after 

due completion.” 

08.  As  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 

17.07.2018,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family 

Court  was  upheld  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court of Pakistan and has attained finality; the 

decree  holders  /  respondents  No.3  &  4  filed 

execution  petition  but  the  petitioner  neither 

paid 

the  decretal  amount 

to  his  minor 

daughter / respondent No.4 nor to his ex-wife 

/ respondent No.3.  

09.  Many opportunities were provided to the 

petitioner for the payment of decretal amount 

but  he  delayed  the  matter  on  one  pretext  or 

 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

another;  learned  executing  Court  vide  order 

dated  05.03.2020, 

issued  perpetual  non-

bailable  warrants  of  arrest  of  the  petitioner  / 

judgment  debtor 

through  SHO,  Member 

(Administration)  of  Pakistan  Atomic  Energy 

Commission  (PAEC)  was  directed  to  assist  the 

police  in  arrest  of  the  petitioner  /  judgment 

debtor,  Chief  Manager  of  the  bank  was  also 

directed  to  freeze  all  the  bank  accounts 

maintained  by  the  petitioner  / 

judgment 

debtor;  mobile  sims  of  the  petitioner  were 

blocked  but  surprisingly,  the  petitioner  / 

judgment debtor has not challenged the order 

dated  05.03.2020,  so,  his  perpetual  non-

bailable  warrants  of  arrest  are  still  intact  and 

order  regarding  freezing  of  all  bank  accounts 

and blocking of mobile sims is also in field.  

10.  When  confronted,  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  admitted  that  with  effect  from 

passing  judgment  dated  17.7.2018,  till  the 

passing  of  impugned  order  dated  21.10.2019 

for  attaching  salary  of 

the  petitioner  / 

judgment  debtor,  the  petitioner  has  not  paid 

 
 
7 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

single  penny  to  respondents  No.3  &4  /  minor 

daughter and ex-wife.  

11. 

Important legal question involved in this 

case is that as to whether the executing Court 

could  pass  an  order  for  attachment  of  the 

salary  of  the  judgment  debtor  in  view  of  the 

provisions  contained  in  section  13(3)  of  the 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964. 

It  would  be 

advantageous 

to 

reproduce 

the 

relevant 

provision of section 13(3) of the Act ibid herein 

below:- 

"13.  Enforcement  of  decrees.  (3) 

Where a decree relates to the payment of 

money  and  the  decretal  amount  is  not 

paid  within  time  specified  by  the  Court 

[not  exceeding  thirty  days],  the  same 

shall,  if  the  Court  so  directs  be  recovered 

as  arrears  of 

land  revenue,  and  on 

recovery  shall  be  paid  to  the  decree-

holder."  

12.  Although  mode  of  execution  has 

explicitly  been  provided  in  the  afore-cited 

provision  and 

the  applicability  of  Civil 

Procedure Code has been excluded in terms of 

section-17  of  the  Act  ibid  however,  by  now  it 

has  become  an  established  law  that  Family 

 
 
8 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

Court might follow the procedure as contained 

in  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  for  execution  of  a 

decree.  Reliance  is  placed  on  "Muhammad 

Ramzan  v.  Ali  Hamza  and  others"  (PLD  2016 

Lahore 622). 

13. 

Specific  provision  for  the  execution  of 

the  decree  does  not  exclude  powers  of  the 

executing  Court  to  adopt  any  other  procedure 

permissible  in  law.  Much  emphasis  has  been 

laid down by learned counsel for the petitioner 

that  sub-clause  (3)  of  section  13  of  the  Act 

ibid,  only  authorizes  the  executing  Court  to 

satisfy  the  decree  through  arrears  of  land 

revenue.  

14. 

Plain 

reading  of 

the  afore-stated 

provision  makes  it  explicitly  clear  that  the 

process  of  recovery  through  arrears  of  land 

revenue  would  come  in  operation  only  when 

the  trial  Court  while  passing  the  decree  had 

expressly  directed  to  do  so,  whereas,  in  this 

particular  case  no  such  direction  exists. 

Therefore, it is open for the executing Court to 

adopt  any  lawful  procedure  for  satisfaction  of 

 
 
9 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

the decree. Reliance is placed on a case titled 

as  "Muhammad  Amin  v.  Judge,  Family 

Court,  Sahiwal  and  3  others"  (2015  YLR 

316) wherein it has been held that:- 

"The  very  wording  in  which  subsection  (3) 

of  section  13  of  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964  is  couched  makes  it 

obvious  that  the  money  decree  is  to  be 

recovered as arrears of land revenue only if 

the  Court  so  directs at  the  time  of  passing 

the  decree.  And  if  no  such  direction  has 

been made by the Court concerned, it may 

follow 

any  procedure 

thereafter 

to 

implement  its  money  decree,  including  the 

arrest  of 

the 

judgment-debtor 

and 

attachment of his property."  

15. 

It  has  been  categorically  laid  down  by 

the Hon'ble Apex Court that the Family Court is 

a  quasi-judicial  forum  which  could  draw  and 

follow 

its  own  procedure  provided  such 

procedure  is  not  against  the  principles  of  fair 

hearing and trial. Reliance is placed on a case 

titled  as  "Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan 

v.  Additional  District  Judge,  Lahore  and 

others" (2014 SCMR 1365), wherein it is held 

that:- 

 
 
10 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

"Family  Court  empowered  to  strike  off 

defendant's  defence  and  pass  ex  parte 

decree---Scope---Family Court was a quasi-

judicial forum, which could draw and follow 

its 

own 

procedure, 

provided 

such 

procedure was not against the principles of 

fair  hearing  and  trial---Defendant  of  a 

family  suit,  who  was  duly  served,  but  did 

not  file  his  written  statement  within  the 

time  allowed  to  him  by  the  court,  the 

Family Court shall have the inherent power 

to  proceed  ex  parte  against  him,  to  strike 

off  the  defence  and  to  pass  an  ex  parte 

decree 

in 

line  with 

the  principles 

enunciated  by  the  Civil  Procedure  Code, 

1908." 

16.  Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan while 

maintaining  the  order  of  attachment  and 

auction of property of judgment debtor passed 

by the executing Court in a family matter, has 

held that: 

“As  to  the  other  argument  of  the  learned 
counsel  nothing  was  brought  on  the  record  to 
show  any  non-compliance  of  the  provisions  of 
Order XXI, rule 54, C.P.C. or of the High Court 
Rules and Orders. The learned counsel failed to 
point  out  with  any  particularity  as  to  how  the 
attachment of the property by the Family Court 
was  vitiated.  In  the  absence  of  any  proof  to 
the contrary we have to presume that all legal 
formalities had been duly fulfilled by the Family 
Court  in  the  process  of  attachment  of  the 
property.  Reference  may  usefully  be  made  to 
the  case  of  'Muhammad  Akbar  Khan  v.  Mian 
Musharaf  Shah  and  another  (AIR  1934  Privy 

 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

substantial  compliance 

Council  217).  In  the  case  of  Ghulam  Abbas  v. 
Mst.  Zohra  Bibi  and  another  (PLD  1972  SC 
337), this Court had held that the provisions of 
Order XXI, rule 54, C.P.C. were not mandatory 
thereof  was 
and 
enough.  Even  otherwise,  the  strict  compliance 
with  such  provisions  of  the  C.P.C.  may  not  be 
insisted  upon  as  its  application  has  beets 
excluded by the provisions of section 17 of the 
Family  Courts  Act,  1964  (Act  NO.XXXV  of 
1964).  Moreover,  the  Special  provisions  of 
section  13  of  the  said  Act  provide  for  the 
execution  of  a  decree  passed  by,  a  Family 
Court.  Similar  view  was  taken  in  the  case  of 
Syed  Muhammad  v.  Mst.  Zeenat  Bibi  (PLD 
2001 SC 128).” 

17. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.3 

&4  has  filed  comments,  whereby  she  has 

mentioned  and  also  attached  certified  copies 

of  the  judgment  dated  04.12.2018,  whereby, 

appeal  filed  by  the  petitioner  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  17.7.2018,  was 

dismissed  by  the  Court  of  learned  Additional 

District Judge, Islamabad; copy of order dated 

21.01.2019 passed in a writ petition No. 213 of 

2019,  whereby  writ  petition  filed  by  the 

petitioner  against  the  judgments  and  decrees 

passed  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court  and 

learned Additional District Judge was dismissed 

and  copy  of  order  dated  20.06.2019,  passed 

by  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  C.P 

No.  858/2019  filed  against  the  order  dated 

 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

21.01.2019  passed  by  this  Court  was  also 

dismissed.  

18. 

The  petitioner  has  not  mentioned  the 

facts  of  dismissal  of  appeal  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  17.7.2018  by  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  this  Court 

and Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan.  

19.  Order was also passed on 27.3.2019, by 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  C.P  No. 

858/2019,  whereby, 

the  petitioner  was 

directed 

to 

deposit 

the 

accumulated 

maintenance  amount  of  child  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.20,000/- per month with annual increase of 

10%,  less  any  amount  already  paid,  in  the 

executing  Court.  Learned  counsel  sought  time 

for one month for compliance of the order but 

during  the  course  of  arguments,  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  admitted  that 

said  order  was  not  complied  with.  It  is  also 

established that the petitioner has violated the 

order  dated  27.3.2019,  passed  by  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan.  

20. 

It  has  been  established 

that 

the 

petitioner  has  concealed  the  material  facts  by 

 
 
13 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

not mentioning the orders passed by this Court 

and  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 

earlier round of litigation. It is established law 

that a person who seeks equity must approach 

the Court with clean hands.  

21. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled  as 

“Shafqatullah and others VS District and 

Sessions Judge, Nowshera, N.W.F.P and 

4 others” (2001 SCMR 274), that:- 

“It would also appear from the record 

that the petitioners did not approach 

the  High  Court  with  clean  hands 

entitling  them  to  the  discretionary, 

equitable 

relief  under 

the 

Constitutional jurisdiction”. 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  a  case  reported  as 

2000 CLC 623 [Lahore]. 

22. 

Impugned  order  was  passed  by  the 

learned Judge Family Court on 21.10.2019 and 

appeal  was  dismissed  by  learned  Appellate 

Court  on  27.11.2019,  but  the  instant  writ 

petition has been filed on 22.03.2021, i.e. after 

the  delay  of  more  than  one  year  and  three 

months,  hence  it  is  not  maintainable  on  the 

principle of laches.  

 
 
14 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

23. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Ahmed and 25 

others VS Ghama and 5 others” (2005 

SCMR 119), it is held by the Hon’ble Supreme 

Court of Pakistan that: 

“There is no cavil with the proposition 

that existence of laches is  sufficient 

for dismissal in limine of petition”. 

It is further held that: 

“We have absolutely no hesitation in 

our mind that the petitioners failed to 

pursue their case vigilantly, vigorously 

and woke up from the deep slumbers 

after  108  days  which  cannot  be 

ignored without sufficient justification 

which is badly lacking in this case”. 

Reliance  is  placed  on  the  cases  reported  as 

2016 SCMR 183, PLD 2016 SC 872, 2019 

SCMR 1720, PLD 2016 SC 514 and 2021 

PLC(C.S) 951. 

24. 

There  are  concurrent  findings  of  both 

the 

learned  Courts  below  against 

the 

petitioner. In case of concurrent finding of the 

courts  below,  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  Reliance  is 

placed on cases reported as 2008 YLR 2309 

& PLD 2008 Karachi 2005. 

 
 
 
15 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

25. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is  only 

available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of 

law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for  correcting 

errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court 

or  a  tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise 

its  jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts 

illegally 

in  exercise  of 

its 

undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice. The High Court while issuing a writ of 

certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of  supervisory  and 

not  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in 

exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not review 

the  findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court  or  a  tribunal.  Reliance  is  placed  on 

cases reported as 2020 SCMR 2155, 2020 

SCMR 260,  2019 SCMR 919,  PLD 2018 

SC 28 & PLD 2007 SC 45.  

26. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed  to  point  out  as  to  how  the  impugned 

order/judgment  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court  and  learned  Additional  District 

Judge were the consequence of an error of law 

 
 
 
16 

Writ Petition No.1179 of 2021 

or  without 

jurisdiction  or 

in  excess  of 

jurisdiction,  hence  both  the  impugned  orders 

do not require any interference by this Court.  

27. 

In  view  of  above,  the  instant  writ 

petition  is  not  maintainable  and  the  same  is 

dismissed being meritless.
