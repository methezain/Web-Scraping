Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

                              25.01.2022.  Ms. Samina Khan, Advocate for petitioner.  

Barrister Afzal Khan Shinwari and Rizwan Faiz 
Muhammad, Advocates for respondents.  

The  petitioner  has  assailed  order,  dated 

30.11.2021,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family 

Court-East, 

Islamabad,  whereby, 

interim 

maintenance  for  Respondents  No.  2  to  4  has 

been  fixed  @  Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  for  each 

child. Ground has been taken that the impugned 

order 

is  not 

tenable 

inasmuch  as 

the 

maintenance is beyond the financial status of the 

petitioner.  

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was 

directed  to  satisfy  this  Court  with  regard  to  the 

maintainability of the instant petition in the light 

of  Section  14  (3)  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Courts  Act,  1964  upon  which  learned  counsel 

submitted that she will be satisfied if  a direction 

is given to the learned Trial Court to conclude the 

matter within one month.  

3. 

Request seems fair and no objection has 

also  been  raised  by  the  respondentsâ€™  side, 

therefore,  learned  trial  Court  is  directed  to 

conclude  the  matter,  pending  between  the 

parties,  within  one  month,  from  the  date  of 

receiving a certified copy of this order.   

4. 

Instant  petition  stands  disposed  of  in 

the above terms.
