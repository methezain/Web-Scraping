ARBAB  MUHAMMAD  TAHIR,  J.The  instant  writ  petition  has 

been filed with the following prayer:- 

“In  view  of  the  above  mentioned  circumstances,  it  is 
therefore,  most  respectfully  prayed  that  instant  writ 
petition  may  kindly  be  allowed  and  the  impugned 
order/decree  dated  14.12.2021  passed  by  the  learned 
respondent  No.2  may  graciously  be  set  aside,  in  the  best 
interest of justice.  
It  is  further  prayed  that  the  respondent  No.3  may  very 
graciously  be  directed  to  submit  the  report  regarding  the 
dissolution  of  marriage  between  the  petitioner  and 
the  copy  of 
respondent  No.1  and  also  produce 
effectiveness  of  divorce  certificate  dated  21.06.2017  of 
the spouses before this Hon’ble Court. 
It  is  also  prayed  that  respondent  No.2  may  kindly  be 
directed to initiate criminal/legal proceedings against the 
respondent  No.1  in  lieu  of  filing  the  false,  frivolous  and 
baseless suit as well as false certification.” 

2. 

Tersely,  relevant  facts  are  that  respondent  No.1  namely  Ms. 

Amna  Hassan  along  with  her  minor  daughter  Aima  Nauman,  on 

22.09.2021  filed  suit  fordissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of 

Khula,  recovery  of  gold  ornaments  and  maintenance  allowance, 

which  was  contested  by  the  petitioner/defendant  by  filing  written

W.P. No.125 of 2022 

statement.  On  14.12.2021,  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  held 

reconciliation  proceedings  and  on  failure  of  the  same  proceeded  to 

decree the suit to the extent of dissolution of marriage on the basis 

of Khula in terms of Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan Family Court 

Act, 1964, being assailed through the instant writ petition.  

3. 

In-addition,  petitioner  also  prays  for  a  direction  to  the 

respondent  No.3  (Arbitration  Council,  Sector  G-11/4  Islamabad)  to 

submit  report  regarding  the  dissolution  of  marriage  between  the 

petitioner  and  the  respondent  No.1  and  to  produce  divorce 

effectiveness certificate dated 21.06.2017.  

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argues  that  after  issuance 

of  divorce  certificate  by  the  respondent  No.3,  the  Family  Court 

retains  no  power  to  grant  decree  for  dissolution  of  marriage  as  the 

suit  filed  by  the  respondent  No.1  was  barred  by  law.  Further 

contended  that  the  petitioner  also  filed  a  suit  for  cancellation  of 

affidavit  dated  23.09.2020  on  the  basis  of  which  respondent  No.1 

filed the suit against the petitioner, therefore, impugned order of the 

Family Court is liable to be set aside.  

5. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1 

repelled 

the  above  submissions  by  contending 

that  after 

pronouncing one divorce, the parties reunited and lived together and 

thereafter due to attitude of the petitioner, respondent No.1 filed the 

suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of  Khula  besides 

recovery  of  gold  ornaments  and  maintenance  allowance  for  herself 

and  for  her  minor  daughter,  therefore,  petition  is  liable  to  be 

dismissed.

7. 

Heard, record perused.  

The  stance  of  the  petitioner  does  not  cohere  with  the  facts 

gathered  from  the  record  asthe  stance  of  pronouncing  one  divorce 

on 07.03.2017 by the petitioner and reunion after about four years 

on 23.09.2020 through a settlement has duly been incorporated by 

the respondent No.1 in paragraph No.7 of the plaint. 

8. 

It is significant to note that reconciliation,as contended by the 

respondent  No.1,  was  entered  into  between  the  parties  through 

writing dated 23.09.2020 (affidavit) but the petitioner opted to assail 

said affidavit after about two and half years of its execution and that 

 
3 

W.P. No.125 of 2022 

tooafter about five months of the filing of the suit by the respondent 

No.1 and her daughter.  

9. 

Another important aspect is that the petitioner in reply to said 

Para-7  on  facts  simply  asserted  that  after  issuance  of  divorce 

certificate dated 21.06.2017, the question of reunion does not arise. 

In  nowhere  in  his  written  statement  it  was  the  stance  of  the 

petitioner that the affidavit dated 23.09.2020 is a forged document, 

as  pleaded  by  him  in  the  plaint  in  suit  for  cancellation  of  affidavit 

filed on 08.02.2022.  

10.  Furthermore,  before  passing  the 

impugned  decree,  the 

respondent  No.1  got  her  statement  recorded  in  terms  that  “her 

marriage  with 

the  defendant/petitioner  was  solemnized  on 

02.11.2012  and  rukhsati  was  effected  on  18.03.2016; 

that 

defendant/petitioner  had  divorced  her 

in  the  year  2017  but 

subsequently again performed Nikah; that now it is impossible for her 

to  reside  with  the  defendant/petitioner  within  the  limits  of  shariah; 

that  defendant/petitioner  is  in  habit  of  pronouncing  divorce  and 

taking back the same; that defendant/petitioner again on 23.09.2020 

in  presence  of  witnesses  solemnized  Nikah  with  her;  that  the 

defendant/petitioner  is  not  ready  to  take  her  back  and  that    it  is 

difficult for her to live with him and prays for dissolution of marriage 

on the basis of Khula.” 

11. 

In  presence  of  the  facts  highlighted  above  coupled  with  the 

statement  of 

the  respondent  No.1, 

impugned  order  dated 

14.12.2021  appears  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  facts  and  law  on 

the  subject  and  does  not  call  for  any  interference.  Consequently, 

instant writ petition is dismissed.
