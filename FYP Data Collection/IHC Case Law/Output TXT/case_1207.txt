Mr Ali Nawaz Kharral, Advocate for petitioner.  

Through  this  petition,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed  order,  dated  17-07-2021,  passed  by 

the  learned  Judge  Family/Guardian  Court, 

Islamabad (West). 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  has,  inter  alia, 

contended  that  a  plain  reading  of  section  17A 

of the Family Courts Act, 1964 does not vest a 

discretion  in  the  learned  court  to  adjourn  the 

matter  relating  to  payment  of  maintenance. 

The  learned  counsel  has  stated  that  the  suit 

was  filed  on  20-10-2020  and  the  interim 

maintenance  was  fixed  vide  order,  dated  25-

01-2021.  The  learned  counsel  has  contended 

that  it  was  mandatory  for  the  court  to  have 

struck of the defence of the respondent in case 

of default in payment.

Let  notices  be  issued  to  respondents 

no.2  and  3.  The  office  is  further  directed  to 

relist the petition in the next week.
