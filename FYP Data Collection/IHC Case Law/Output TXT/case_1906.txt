MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB  J:-  Through  the  instant 

Civil  Revision  Petition,  the  petitioner,  Muhammad  Nawaz, 

impugns  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.12.2015,  passed  by 

the  Court  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad, 

whereby  the  petitioner’s  appeal  (Civil  Appeal  No.181/2015) 

against 

the  consolidated 

judgment  and  decrees  dated 

06.07.2015,  passed  by  the  Court  of  the  learned  Civil  Judge, 

Islamabad,  was  dismissed.  Vide  consolidated  judgment  and 

decrees dated 06.07.2015, passed by the learned Civil Court, the 

following three suits were decided:- 

(i)  the  suit  for  declaration,  mandatory  and  permanent 
injunction,  instituted  on  10.10.2011,  by  Shahida 
Perveen/respondent  No.1 
against  Muhammad 
Nawaz/petitioner was partially decreed;  

(ii)   the suit for declaration, possession of residential premises 
measuring 10 marlas, mandatory and perpetual injunction, 
instituted on 22.10.2011, by Muhammad Nawaz/petitioner 
against  Shahida  Perveen/respondent  No.1  etc.,  was 
dismissed; and  

(iii)  the  suit  for  declaration,  separate  possession  through 
partition,  permanent  and  mandatory  injunction,  and 
recovery  of  mense  profit,  instituted  on  09.02.2011, 
instituted by Shahida Perveen/respondent No.1 against 
Qaseeda Begum/respondent No.2 etc., was dismissed. 

2. 

The facts essential for the disposal of this petition are that 

on 09.11.1981, the petitioner applied to the Capital Development 

Authority  (“C.D.A.”)  for  an  allotment  of  a  plot.  Vide  allotment 

letter dated 24.09.1985, the C.D.A. allotted plot No.21 measuring

C.R.No.112/2016 

2.695 acres, I-8-V, Murree Road, Islamabad (“the suit plot”), to (i) 

Muhammad  Hanif,  (ii)  Muhammad  Nawaz/petitioner,  and  (iii) 

Yaqoob  Khan,  a lumbardar.  Muhammad  Nawaz  and  Muhammad 

Hanif  were  brothers.  Yaqoob  Khan  died  on  04.04.2001.  On 

02.02.2005,  Yaqoob  Khan’s  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot  was 

transferred  by  the  C.D.A.  to  his  legal  heirs.  The  ownership  of 

1/3rd share in the suit plot by the legal heirs of Yaqoob Khan is not 

in  dispute.  Muhammad  Hanif  died  on  16.07.2009,  and  was 

survived  by  a  widow  (Qaseeda  Begum/respondent  No.2),  a  son 

(Sajid  Mahmood/respondent  No.3),  and  a  daughter  (Shahida 

Perveen/respondent  No.1).  The  ownership  of  1/3rd  share  in  the 

suit plot by the petitioner is also not in dispute. What is disputed 

is  the  ownership  of  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot  by  Muhammad 

Hanif.  

3. 

The  petitioner  claims  that  his  brother,  Muhammad  Hanif, 

was  only  a benami/ostensible  owner  of  the  1/3rd  share,  and  that 

the petitioner  is  the real  owner of the  said  share.  The petitioner 

claims  that  when  the  suit  plot  was  allotted,  the  petitioner  was 

gainfully  employed  in  the  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia,  and  had 

executed  a  special  power  of  attorney  in  Muhammad  Hanif’s 

favour  authorizing  him  to  do  certain  things  with  respect  to  the 

suit plot. The petitioner also claims to have paid all the expenses 

and ancillary dues regarding the suit plot.  

4. 

On  10.10.2011,  Shahida  Perveen/respondent  No.1 

instituted  a  suit  for  declaration,  mandatory  and  permanent 

injunction 

against 

her 

paternal 

uncle,  Muhammad 

Nawaz/petitioner,  before  the  Court  of  learned  Civil  Judge, 

Islamabad.  In  the  said  suit it was inter-alia pleaded  that  the suit 

plot  was  jointly  owned  by  Muhammad  Hanif  and  Yaqoob  Khan; 

that  respondent  No.1’s  father  died  on  16.07.2009,  whereafter 

respondent  No.1  along  with  her  mother  and  brother  became 

owners  of  Muhammad  Hanif’s  share  in  the  suit  plot;  that 

respondent No.1 was in possession of her share in the suit plot; 

and  that  respondent  No.1  instituted  the  said  civil  suit  because 

the  petitioner  had  started  constructing  a  boundary  wall  around 

the  suit  plot.  In  the  said  suit,  respondent  No.1  prayed  for  a 

 
  
3 

C.R.No.112/2016 

declaration  that  on  account  of  being  a  legal  heir  of  Muhammad 

Hanif,  she  was  entitled  to  use  the  suit  property,  and  that  the 

petitioner’s  acts  were  unlawful  and  ineffective  on  respondent 

No.1’s  rights.  Respondent  No.1  also  prayed  for  a  mandatory 

injunction 

directing 

the 

petitioner 

to 

remove 

the 

construction/boundary  wall  erected  on  the  suit  plot,  and  for  a 

permanent  injunction  restraining  the  petitioner  from  interfering 

with respondent No.1’s peaceful possession of the suit plot.  

5. 

The  petitioner  contested  the  said  suit  by  filing  a  written 

statement. In the said written statement, it was inter-alia pleaded 

that  on  10.11.1981,  the  petitioner  had  applied  to  the  C.D.A.  for 

the  allotment  of  a  plot;  that  on  the  petitioner’s  said  application, 

leasehold  rights  regarding  the suit plot  were  granted  by  C.D.A.; 

that  the  petitioner’s  share  in  the  suit  plot  was  2/3rd  whereas 

Yaqoob  Khan’s  share  was  1/3rd;  that  Muhammad  Hanif’s  name 

was 

included  as  1/3rd  owner  of 

the  suit  plot  as 

benamidar/ostensible  owner;  that  the  petitioner  was  gainfully 

employed  in  Saudi  Arabia  for  a  period  of  11  years,  and  had  the 

resources  to  pay  for  the  suit  plot;  that  all  expenses  and  dues 

regarding  the  suit  plot  were  paid  by  the  petitioner;  that 

Muhammad  Hanif  had  no  source  of  income,  and  could  not 

contribute  any  amount  as  consideration  for  the  suit  plot;  that 

Muhammad  Hanif,  prior  to  his  death,  was  willing  to  transfer  his 

1/3rd share in the suit plot to the petitioner; that the petitioner had 

raised  construction  on  10  marlas  of  the  suit  plot  with  his  own 

funds;  that  since  Muhammad  Hanif  did  not  have  a  house  of  his 

own,  the  petitioner  let  him  and  his  family  reside  in  the  rooms 

constructed  on  the  suit  plot;  and  that  Muhammad  Hanif’s  legal 

heirs  rejected  the  petitioner’s  request  to  transfer  1/3rd  share  in 

the suit plot to the petitioner.  

6. 

Prior  to  the  filing  of  the  written  statement  in  the  suit 

instituted by respondent No.1, the petitioner, on 22.10.2011, had 

filed  a  suit  for  declaration,  possession  of  residential  premises 

measuring  10  marlas,  mandatory  and  perpetual 

injunction 

against  the  legal  heirs  of  Muhammad  Hanif  before  the  Court  of 

the learned Civil Judge, Islamabad. The petitioner’s pleadings in 

 
4 

C.R.No.112/2016 

the said suit are almost the same as his pleadings in the written 

statement in the suit instituted by respondent No.1. This suit was 

contested  only  by  Shahida  Perveen/respondent  No.1. 

Respondents  No.2  and  3  (i.e.  the  widow  and  son  of  Muhammad 

Hanif)  had  filed  a  conceding  written  statement  in  the  said  suit. 

The  position  taken  by  respondent  No.1  was  that  the  petitioner 

had  no  concern  whatsoever  with  the  suit  plot,  and  that  the  suit 

plot had been allotted by C.D.A. to Muhammad Hanif and Yaqoob 

Khan  in  equal  shares.  She  also  pleaded  that  Muhammad  Hanif 

had sufficient financial resources to pay for his share in the suit 

plot.  

7. 

On  09.02.2012,  respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  against  her 

mother  and  brother  (i.e.  respondents  No.  2  and  3  respectively) 

for  declaration,  separate  possession 

through  partition, 

permanent  and  mandatory  injunction,  and  recovery  of  mense 

profit. In the said suit, respondent No.1 had inter-alia prayed for 

the  suit  plot  to  be  partitioned  and  separate  possession  of  her 

share  in  the  suit  plot  to  be  given  her.  She  also  prayed  for  a 

permanent  injunction  restraining  respondents  No.2  and  3  from 

selling,  alienating  or  changing  the  nature  of  the  suit  plot. 

Subsequently,  the  petitioner/Muhammad  Nawaz  was  impleaded 

as  a  defendant  in  the  said  suit.  In  the  written  statement  filed  by 

respondents No.2 and 3, they took the position that they had no 

concern whatsoever with the suit plot; and that 2/3rd share in the 

suit plot belonged  to the petitioner, whereas the  remaining 1/3rd 

share  belonged  to  Yaqoob  Khan.  Furthermore,  it  was  pleaded 

that Muhammad Hanif had paid  nothing as consideration for the 

suit plot; that respondents No.2 and 3 were residing in the rooms 

constructed on the suit plot with the petitioner’s permission; and 

that  Muhammad  Hanif  was  only  a  benami/ostensible  owner  of 

1/3rd share in the suit plot.  

8. 

On  10.06.2013,  the  learned  Civil  Court  consolidated  the 

above  mentioned  three civil  suits.  From  the divergent pleadings 

of  the  contesting  parties,  the  learned  Civil  Court  framed  the 

following consolidated issues:- 

 
5 

C.R.No.112/2016 

1.  Whether Mst. Shahida Perveen along with her mother and 

brother is in possession of suit property? OPP 

2.  Whether Muhammad Hanif was only benami owner of suit 

property? OPD 

3.  Whether Mst. Shahida Perveen has no cause of action to file 

the suit? OPD 

4.  Whether  Mst.  Shahida  Perveen  is  entitled  to  the  relief 

claimed for? OPP 

5.  Relief.  

9. 

Respondent  No.1  entered  the  witness  box  as  PW-1, 

whereas  the  petitioner  gave  evidence  as  DW-1.  The  petitioner 

and  respondent  No.1  also  produced  other  witnesses  in  support 

of  their  respective  cases.  As  mentioend  above,  vide  the  said 

judgment and decrees dated 06.07.2015, the learned Civil Court 

partially  decreed  the  suit  for  declaration,  mandatory  and 

permanent  injunction  instituted  by  respondent  No.1  (Shahida 

Perveen),  and  dismissed  the  suit  for  declaration,  possession  of 

residential  premises  measuring  10  marlas,  mandatory  and 

perpetual injunction instituted by the petitioner. 

10.  Vide  judgment  dated  08.12.2015,  the  petitioner’s  appeal 

(Civil  Appeal  No.181/2015)  against  the  judgment  and  decrees 

dated  16.07.2015,  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court,  was 

dismissed  by  the Court of  the learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad. The said concurrent judgments of the learned Courts 

below  have  been  impugned  by  the  petitioner  in  the  instant  Civil 

Revision Petition.  

11.  The  grounds  taken  by  the  petitioner  in  the  Civil  Revision 

Petition are that the impugned judgment and decrees are illegal, 

perverse  and  against  the  norms  of  justice;  that  the  learned  trial 

Court  exercised 

its 

jurisdiction 

illegally  and  with  material 

irregularity;  that  the  learned  Courts  below  did  not  give  any 

weight  to  the  conceding  written  statement  filed  by  respondents 

No.2  and  3;  that  the  impugned  judgment  and  decrees  are  the 

result  of  misreading  and  non-reading  of  evidence;  that  the 

learned  Courts  below 

ignored  the  oral  and  documentary 

evidence produced by the petitioner; and that the petitioner had 

proved  that  Muhammad  Hanif  was  only  a benami owner  of  1/3rd 

 
 
6 

C.R.No.112/2016 

share  in  the  suit  plot.  The  petitioner  in  his  revision  petition 

prayed for the suit instituted by the petitioner to be decreed, and 

for the suit instituted by respondent No.1 to be dismissed.  

12.  Learned  counsel  for  the  contesting  parties  made  their 

submissions  in  reiteration  of  their  pleadings  before  the  learned 

Courts  below.  For  the  sake  of  brevity,  these  submissions  need 

not be restated. 

13.  Additionally,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted 

that the suit plot was allotted to Yaqoob Khan and the petitioner 

as rehabilitation benefit by the C.D.A.; that 1/3rd share in the suit 

plot  was  ‘transferred’  by  the  petitioner  in  Muhammad  Hanif’s 

name; that since the petitioner was gainfully employed abroad, a 

power  of  attorney  was  executed  by  him  in  Muhammad  Hanif’s 

favour  to  do  certain  things  with  respect  to  the  suit  plot;  that 

relationship based on mutual trust and love existed between the 

petitioner  and  his  brother,  Muhammad  Hanif;  that  Muhammad 

Hanif  in  his  lifetime  had  acknowledged  that  he  had  no  share  in 

the suit plot; that since Muhammad Hanif did not have a house of 

his own, a house was constructed by the petitioner on 10 marlas 

of the suit plot so that Muhammad Hanif and his family could live 

in  it;  that  the  title  documents  as  well  as  receipt  of  payments  to 

C.D.A. are in the petitioner’s possession; that respondents No.2 

and  3  also  acknowledge  that  Muhammad  Hanif  did  not  have  a 

share  in  the  suit  plot;  that  the  motive  for  making  Muhammad 

Hanif a benami owner of 1/3rd share in the suit plot was  that the 

petitioner  was  abroad  and  he  wanted  his  brother  to  do  all  that 

was  necessary  with  respect  to  the  suit  plot.  Learned  counsel 

prayed  for  the  concurrent  judgments  passed  by  the  learned 

Courts  below  to  be  set  aside  and  for  the  suit  instituted  by  the 

petitioner  to  be  decreed.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of  Mazim-ud-Din  VS  Sheikh  Zia-ul-

Qamar (2016 SCMR 24), Mandi Hassan VS Muhammad Arif (PLD 

2015  SC  137)  and  Muhammad  Baksh  VS  Gul  Muhammad  (2012 

YLR  1045),  in support  of his  contention that  concurrent  findings 

of fact recorded by the trial Court and the appellate Court can be 

interfered  with  in  the  revisional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  where 

 
7 

C.R.No.112/2016 

there  is  misreading  and  non-reading  of  evidence.  Additionally, 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  placed  reliance  on  the 

following cases:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Sajjad  Hussain  VS  Muhammad 

Anwar  Hussain  (1991 SCMR  703),  it  has  been  held  that  the 

criteria  for  determining  whether  a  transaction  is  benami 

transaction  or  not, 

the 

factors 

to  be 

taken 

into 

consideration  are  (i)  source  of  consideration,  (ii)  from 

whose custody the original title deed and other documents 

came  in  evidence;  (iii)  who  is  in  possession  of  the  suit 

property, and (iv) motive for the benami transaction.  

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Major  (Retd.)  Mazhar  Mahmood  Khan  VS 

Khushal Khan Jadoon (1995 MLD 316), it has been inter-alia 

held that benami transaction is a custom of the country and 

is  recognized  as  such.  In  such  cases,  a  person  purchases 

the property in the name of another but for his own benefit.  

14.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1 

submitted that the petitioner wanted to deprive respondent No.1 

of  her  share  in  her  father’s  inheritance;  that  respondent  No.1’s 

father  was  the  owner  of  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot;  that  the 

allotment  letter  and  certificate  of  possession  issued  by  the 

C.D.A. show that respondent No.1’s father was 1/3rd owner of the 

suit plot; that the suit plot was allotted as rehabilitation benefit to 

the allottees; that the petitioner had not purchased the suit plot; 

that  respondent  No.1  was  married  and  was  living  with  her 

husband; that a portion of the  suit plot was in respondents No.2 

and  3’s  possession;  that  the  conceding  written  statement  of 

respondents  No.2  and  3  cannot  operate  against  the  interests  of 

respondent  No.1;  that  respondent  No.1’s  father  was  not  a 

benami  owner  of  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot;  that  the  essential 

ingredients for proving a transaction to be benami in nature were 

missing  in  this  case;  that  the  concurrent  judgments  of  the 

learned Courts below did not suffer from any misreading or non-

reading  of  evidence  so  as  to  warrant  interference  in  the 

revisional 

jurisdiction  of  this  Court.  Learned  counsel  for 

respondent No.1 prayed for the revision petition to be dismissed. 

 
8 

C.R.No.112/2016 

15. 

I have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the 

contesting  parties,  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance.  The  facts  leading  to  the  filing  of  this  Civil  Revision 

Petition  have  been  set  out in  sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  2  to 

10 above. 

16.  On  09.11.1981,  the  petitioner  submitted  an  application 

(Mark D/A) to the Chairman, C.D.A. seeking an allotment of a plot 

as  compensation  for  the  acquisition  of  his  land  measuring  15 

acres. It is an admitted position that the suit plot was allotted by 

the C.D.A. vide allotment letter dated 24.09.1985 (Ex.P-4/1), to (i) 

Muhammad  Hanif  (who  was  the  petitioner’s  elder  brother),  (ii) 

Muhammad  Nawaz/petitioner,  and  (iii)  Yaqoob  Khan  (who  was  a 

Lumberdar). Paragraph 4 of the allotment letter provides that the 

allottees  were  required  to  execute  a  lease  agreement  with  the 

C.D.A.  Lease  agreement  dated  10.12.1986  was  executed 

between  the  C.D.A.  and  the  three  allottees.  Each  page  of  the 

lease  agreement  dated  10.12.1986  bears  one  signature  of 

Yaqoob  Khan  and 

two  signatures  of  Muhammad  Hanif. 

Muhammad  Hanif’s  second  signature  is  as  the  petitioner’s 

special  attorney.  Vide  letter  dated  28.10.1985  (Mark-D/C)  the 

Estate  Management  Directorate,  C.D.A.  requested  the  Deputy 

Director  (Survey),  Land  Survey  Division,  C.D.A.  to  arrange 

delivery  of  possession  of  the suit  plot to its  allottees.  This  letter 

also  shows  that  the  allottees  had  deposited  the  required 

payment for the suit plot. The certificate of possession (Ex.P-4/2) 

issued  by  the  C.D.A.  on  13.05.1986,  bears  the  signatures  of 

Muhammad  Hanif  and  Yaqoob  Khan  as  allottees  of  the  suit  plot. 

None  of  the  above  referred  documents  indicate  that  2/3rd  share 

in  the  suit  plot  actually  belonged  to  the  petitioner  or  that  1/3rd 

share  in  the  suit  plot  was  transferred/allotted  to  Muhammad 

Hanif on the petitioner’s request.    

17.  This  case  entails  a  dispute  between  a  paternal  uncle 

(Muhammad  Nawaz/petitioner)  and  his  niece 

(Shahida 

Parveen/respondent  No.1).  Respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  for 

declaration  etc.,  seeking  her  inheritance  rights  in  1/3rd  share  in 

the suit plot, whereas the petitioner filed a suit praying for inter-

 
9 

C.R.No.112/2016 

alia a declaration that respondent No.1’s late father, Muhammad 

Hanif,  was  an  ostensible/benami  owner  of  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit 

plot,  and  that  the  petitioner  was  the  real  owner  of  the  said  1/3rd 

share,  in  addition  to  another  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot.  The 

petitioner’s case was based on the assertion that the allotment of 

the suit plot by the C.D.A., to the extent of transferring leasehold 

rights 

in  the  name  of  Muhammad  Hanif,  was  a  benami 

transaction.    In  other  words,  the  petitioner’s  case  was  that  the 

allotment  of  the  suit  plot  in  the  names  of  the  petitioner  and 

Yaqoob Khan was correct, but to the extent of Muhammad Hanif, 

it  was  a  benami  transaction,  and  that  the  real  owner  of 

Muhammad Hanif’s share was the petitioner. 

18. 

In  Pakistan,  benami  transactions  were  a  recognized 

species of legal transactions pertaining to immovable properties. 

The  genesis  of  the  concept  of  benami  is  that  the  consideration 

for  a  transfer  of  property  must  flow  from  one  person  and  the 

transfer  is  made  in  the  name  of  the  other  person,  and  the 

consideration  flowing  for  the  transfer  was  not  intended  to  be  a 

gift in favour  of the person  in  whose name the transfer is made. 

In other words, benami transactions are purchases of property in 

the  name  of  a  person,  who  does  not  pay  consideration  for  the 

property,  but  merely  lends  his  name  to  become  an  ostensible 

owner, while  the  real  title  vests  in  another  person,  who  actually 

pays  for  the  property  and  becomes  the  beneficial  owner.  Such 

transactions are rife in Pakistan. In the case of Guru Narayan VS 

Sheolal Singh (AIR 1918 PC 140), the Right Hon'ble Syed Ameer 

Ali  also  made  the  following  general  observations  on  benami 

transactions:- 

"The system of acquiring and holding property and even of 
carrying on business in names other than those of the real 
owners, usually called the benami system, is and has been 
a  common  practice  in  the  country.  There  is  nothing 
inherently wrong in it, and it accords, within its legitimate 
scope, with the ideas and habits of the people." 

19.  The word ‘benami’ is a Persian compound word made up of 

two  different  words  namely  –  “be”  which  means  “without”  and 

“name”  which  denotes  “name”.  It,  therefore,  literally  means 

 
 
10 

C.R.No.112/2016 

“without  a  name”,  i.e.,  nameless  or  fictitious  and  as  such  a 

benami name is used to denote a transaction which is really done 

by  a  person  without  using  his  own  name  but  in  the  name  of 

another.  The  principle  underlying  benami  transactions 

is 

embodied in Section 82 of the Trust Act 1882, which reads:-  

“Where  property  is  transferred  to  one  person  for  a 
consideration  paid  or  provided  by  another  person,  and  it 
appears that such other person did not intend to pay or provide 
such  consideration  for  the  benefit  of  the  transferee,  the 
transferee must hold the property for the benefit of the person 
paying or providing the consideration.” 

20. 

It is well settled that the burden of proving that a particular 

sale is benami and the apparent purchaser is not the real owner, 

always rests on the person asserting it to be so. This burden has 

to  be  strictly  discharged  by  adducing  evidence  of  a  definite 

character which would either directly prove the fact of benami or 

establish  circumstances  unerringly  raising  an  inference  of  that 

fact.  In  order  to  determine  whether  a  transaction  is  benami or 

not the Courts are usually guided by the following factors:-  

"(1)  the source from which the purchase money came;  
(2)   the nature and possession of the property, after the 

purchase;  

(3)   motive  if  any,  for  giving  the  transaction  a  benami 

complexion;  

(4)   the position of the parties and the relationship, if any, 

between the claimant and the alleged benamidar;  
(5)   the custody of the title-deeds after the transaction and  
(6)   the conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the 

property after the sale." 

21.  A notion of wide prevalence is that benami transactions are 

regarded  as  reprehensible  and  improper.  In  the  case  of  Punjab 

Province  VS  Daulat  Singh  (AIR  1942  Federal  Court  38),  it  has 

been held inter-alia as follows:-  

“A practice has long been common in this country for intending 
alienees of land to take the document of transfer in the names of 
their friends or relatives, sometimes with a view to defeat the 
claims by other members of their own family, and sometimes to 
escape  restrictions  imposed  upon  them  by  Government 
servants’ conduct rules.”  

22.  The  Indian  parliament  realising  the  quantum  of dishonesty 

involved  in benami  transactions  prohibited  the  same  in  the  year 

1988.  After  coming  into  operation  of  the  Benami  Transactions 

(Prohibition)  Act,  1988  (Act  No.XLV  of  1988),  such  transactions 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

C.R.No.112/2016 

are  prohibited  in  India.  In  Pakistan,  the  Benami  Transactions 

(Prohibition) Act, 2017 (Act No.V of 2017), has been enacted for 

the prohibition of holding property in benami, and to restrict the 

right  to  recover  or  transfer  property  held  in  benami,  and  to 

provide a mechanism and procedure for confiscation of property 

held in benami, and for matters connected herewith or incidental 

thereto.  Section  3  (1)  of  the  said  Act  provides  that  no  person 

shall  enter  into  any benami  transaction.  Section  3  (2)  read  with 

Section  51  provides  that  whoever  enters  into  any  benami 

transaction or holds any benami property on and after the date of 

the  commencement  of  the  said  Act,  shall  be  punishable  with 

rigorous  imprisonment  for  a  term  which  shall  not  be  less  than 

one year, but which may extend to seven years and shall also be 

liable  to  a  fine  which  may  extend  to  twenty-five  per  cent  of  the 

fair  market  value  of  the  property.  Under  Section  4  read  with 

Section  25  of  the  said  Act,  any  property  which  is  held  to  be 

benami by the Adjudicating Authority constituted under the said 

Act,  the  same  can  be  confiscated,  and  after  an  order  of 

confiscation  has  been  made  such  property  shall  vest  absolutely 

in  the  Federal  Government.  Under  Section  5  of  the  said  Act,  a 

benamidar  has  been  prohibited  from  retransferring  benami 

property  to  the  beneficial  owner.  The  transactions  taken  out  of 

the  meaning  of  ‘benami transactions’  are  the  ones  when  the 

property is held by:  

“(a) a person standing in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of 
another person towards whom he stands in such capacity and 
includes a trustee, executor, partner, director of a company, 
agent or legal adviser, and any other person as may be notified 
by the Federal Government of this purpose; or  

(b) any person being an individual in the name of his spouse or 
in the name of any child or in the name of his brother and sister 
or leniel ascendant or descendent and the individual appeal as 
joint  owner  in  any  document  of  such  individual  and  the 
consideration for such property has been provided or paid out 
of known resources of income of the individual.”  

23.  Unlike 

the 

Indian 

statute 

(Benami  Transactions 

(Prohibition)  Act,  1988),  the  Benami  Transactions  (Prohibition) 

Act,  2017,  has  prospective  effect.  Section  56  of  the  Benami 

Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 2017, provides that the provisions 

 
 
 
12 

C.R.No.112/2016 

of  the  said  Act  shall  apply  notwithstanding  anything  to  the 

contrary  contained  in  any  other  law  for  the  time  being  in  force. 

Hence, the said Act overrides other laws including Section 82 of 

the Trust Act 1882. 

24.  Coming  back  to  the  facts  of  the  case  at  hand,  the  vital 

question that needs to be answered is whether Muhammad Hanif 

was the real or an  ostensible/benami owner of 1/3rd share in the 

suit  plot.  The  petitioner,  in  his  civil  suit,  has  inter-alia  pleaded 

that  at  the  time  of  the  allotment  of  the  suit  plot,  the  petitioner 

“included as benami the name of his brother Muhammad Hanif to 

the extent of 1/3 share in the suit plot.”    Furthermore,  the 

petitioner in his cross-examination deposed inter-alia as follows:-  

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________________ 

25.  Now, the petitioner claims to have ‘transferred’ 1/3rd share 

in  the  suit  plot  to  his  brother,  Muhammad  Hanif.  Not  a  single 

document  has  been  produced  in  evidence  to  show  that  1/3rd 

share in the suit plot was ‘transferred’ to Muhammad Hanif at the 

petitioner’s  instance.  The  petitioner  did  not  bother  to  file  an 

application for summoning the record from the C.D.A. in order to 

establish that 2/3rd share in the suit plot was to be allotted to the 

petitioner or that the petitioner had applied to the C.D.A. to allot 

or transfer 1/3rd share in the suit plot to Muhammad Hanif.  

26.  The  petitioner  in  his  suit  had  pleaded  that  respondents 

No.1  and  3  were  greedy  and  were  refusing  to  transfer 

Muhammad Hanif’s share in the suit plot to the petitioner. It was 

also  pleaded  that  respondents  No.1  and  3  were  liable  to  be 

evicted  from  the  suit  plot.  It  appears  that  after  the  institution  of 

the  said  suit,  respondents  No.2  and  3  were  won  over  by  the 

petitioner.  The  said  respondents  filed  a  conceding  written 

statement 

in  the  petitioner’s  suit  admitting 

in  totality  the 

 
 
 
 
13 

C.R.No.112/2016 

petitioner's  claim  regarding  Muhammad  Hanif’s  ownership  of 

1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot  to  be benami  in  nature.  The  position 

taken  by  respondents  No.2  and  3  in  their  written  statement 

cannot operate to the detriment of respondent No.1. In the cases 

of  Farzand  Ali  VS  Kuuda  Bakhsh  (PLD  2015  SC  187),  Bashir 

Ahmad  VS  Abdul  Latif  (2005  YLR  2655),  Bakhan  VS  Ahmad  Yar 

(2006 YLR 831), Allah Rakha VS Nisar Khan (2007 CLC 154), and 

Riffat  Sultana  VS  Nadir  Khan  (2016  YLR  110),  it  has  been  held 

that  admission  of  one  defendant  is  not  binding  on  another 

defendant,  who  had  contested  the  matter.  In  the  case  of  Mrs. 

Riffat Sultana VS Nadir Hayat (2016 YLR 110), it has been held by 

the Hon'ble Lahore High Court, as follows:-  

“It is settled principle of law that the pleadings in the shape of 
plaint or written statement cannot be treated as a piece of 
evidence unless the same are proved by the production of 
evidence and the adversaries are afforded opportunity to rebut 
the  same  through  cross-examination  of  the  witnesses  and 
produce the evidence. The contention of the learned counsel for 
the plaintiff that whenever conceding written statement is filed 
by the defendant, the same provides a valid proof and no further 
evidence is required to prove the same might have some force 
in a case of single defendant, but herein respondent No.2 had 
filed conceding written statement against the version of her co-
defendants  in  the  suit  and  unless  they  were  afforded 
opportunity of cross-examination to shatter the credibility of her 
version, the same could not be treated as a gospel truth.” 

27.  Respondent No.1 (PW-1) in her examination-in-chief as well 

as cross-examination admitted that possession of the suit plot is 

with  Muhammad  Nawaz 

(petitioner),  Qaseeda  Begum 

(respondent  No.2)  and  Muhammad  Sajid  Mahmood  (respondent 

No.3).  Respondent  No.1  is  married  and  lives  with  her  husband. 

There  is  evidence  available  on  the  record  that  until  she  got 

married she lived in the house on the suit plot. The mere fact that 

she  is  presently  not  in  possession  of  a  portion  of  the  suit  plot 

would  not  operate  to  her  disadvantage.  It  cannot  be  expected 

that her husband would move in with her and live in the house on 

the  suit  plot.  It  may  also  be  mentioned  that  the  petitioner  in  his 

suit  had  prayed  for  possession  of  the  portion  of  the  suit  plot  on 

which the house was constructed. In paragraph 7 of the suit, the 

petitioner  had  pleaded  that  respondents  No.1  and  3  were  in 

possession  of  the  house  on  the  suit  plot.  Hence,  the  essential 

 
 
14 

C.R.No.112/2016 

ingredient of a benami transaction i.e. possession of the benami 

property, has not been satisfied by the petitioner.   

28.  As  regards  possession  of 

the  allotment 

letter/title 

document regarding the suit plot, the petitioner in his suit did not 

plead that the allotment letter/title document is in his possession. 

During  his  evidence,  the  petitioner  (DW-1)  did  not  produce  the 

original  allotment  letter  or  the  lease  agreement.  The  allotment 

letter  (Exh.PW-4/1)  was  produced  by  PW-4,  namely  Malik  Abid 

Farooq, an official in the C.D.A. Although, respondent No.1 (PW-

1)  and  her  husband,  Arshad  Mahmood  (PW-3),  in  their  cross-

examination, deposed that the original allotment letter was not in 

their possession, and that the original documents with respect to 

the  suit  plot  were  with  the  petitioner,  the  fact  remains  that  the 

petitioner  did  not  produce  the  original  allotment  letter  or  the 

lease agreement during his evidence. Had the petitioner been in 

possession  of  these  crucial  documents  there  was  nothing 

preventing  him  from  producing  them  in  his  evidence.  For  all 

intents  and  purposes,  the  allotment 

letter  and  the 

lease 

agreement  would  be  the  title  documents  in  this  case.  Since  the 

petitioner did not produce the title documents with respect to the 

suit plot, he could not claim to be the real owner of 1/3rd share in 

the suit plot. 

29.  The petitioner in his suit had pleaded that “all the expenses 

of allotment and dues of the suit plot were paid” by the petitioner, 

yet when the petitioner entered the witness box as DW-1, he did 

not  produce  a  single  receipt.  Copies  of  the  receipts  were 

produced  before  the  learned  trial  Court  after  the  petitioner’s 

evidence along with the statement of the learned counsel for the 

petitioner,  Chaudhry  Manzoor  Ahmad  Kamboh,  Advocate.  Had 

the  petitioner  produced  these  documents,  respondent  No.1 

would  have  had  an  opportunity  to  cross-examine  him.  The 

documents 

included  the  special  power  of  attorney  dated 

15.01.1986;  transfer  letter  dated  02.02.2005  for  the  transfer  of 

Yaqoob  Khan’s  share  in  the  suit  plot  to  his  legal  heirs;  receipt 

dated  22.09.2004  for  Rs.1,72.000/-  from  Muslim  Commercial 

Bank; letter of possession dated 13.05.1986; and the petitioner’s 

 
15 

C.R.No.112/2016 

application  to  the  Chairman,  C.D.A.  (Mark-D/A).  The  learned 

counsel for the petitioner also produced copies of pay orders for 

various  amounts  in  favour  of  C.D.A.  These  documents  were 

produced as Marks D/D to D/K. The production of some of these 

documents  were  objected  to  by  the 

learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.1.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

placed  emphasis  on  the  treasury  deposit  challan  (Mark-D/G)  for 

payment of Rs.7,700/- as the price of non-judicial stamps for the 

execution  of  the  agreement  with  C.D.A.  The  said  amount  is 

stated  to  have  been  tendered  by  Yaqoob  Khan  and  Muhammad 

Hanif  in  his  capacity  as  the  petitioner’s  general  attorney.  Now, 

copies of the documents produced as Marks D/D to D/K could not 

be  relied  upon  by  the  petitioner  as  payments  for  the  portion  of 

the suit plot allotted to Muhammad Hanif. Even otherwise, in the 

case  of  State  Life  Insurance  Corporation  of  Pakistan  VS  Javaid 

Iqbal  (2011  SCMR  1013),  it  has  been  inter-alia  held  that  a 

document not produced and proved in evidence but only marked 

could not be considered by Courts as legal evidence of a fact. 

30. 

In  the  case  at  hand,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

could not come up with any explanation as to why the petitioner 

(DW-1),  during  his  evidence,  did  not  produce  the  documents 

which  were  produced  by  his  counsel.  These  documents  are 

copies of cheques and pay orders which the petitioner claims to 

have  paid  to  the  C.D.A.  as  allotment  charges  etc.  All  these 

documents  predate  the  institution  of  the  suit  by  the  petitioner. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  also  produced/exhibited 

the original power of attorney along with his statement. Why did 

the  occasion  for  this  arise?  Why  did  the  petitioner  not  produce 

the  power  of  attorney  during  his  evidence?  All  these  factors 

make  the  petitioner’s  case  of  the  allotment  of  1/3rd  share  of  the 

suit plot in Muhammad Hanif’s name as benami most doubtful to 

say  the  least.  The  documents  produced  by  the  learned  counsel 

for the petitioner along with his statement were neither copies of 

judicial record nor public documents.       

31. 

In certain  circumstances, the counsel for  either party may 

produce  documents  which  are  certified  copies  of  public  or 

 
16 

C.R.No.112/2016 

judicial  record.  Documents  cannot  be  produced  by  the  counsel 

for  a  party  in  order  to  plug  the  loopholes  or  to  address  the 

deficiencies  in the such party’s  evidence.  In  the  case  of  BABAP 

Enterprises  VS  United  Bank  Limited  (2011  CLC  1534),  the 

Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  held  that  documents  that  could  be 

exhibited  or  tendered  in  evidence  by  a  witness,  could  not  be 

exhibited  in  the  statement  of  the  counsel  for  a  party.  The 

statement  of  the  counsel  is  not  on  oath  and  he  is  not  cross-

examined  by  the opposing  party  on the  veracity  and  evidentiary 

value  of  the  documents  so  tendered.  In  the  case  of  Muhammad 

Ashraf  VS  Shah  Noor  Khan  (1996  MLD  1819),  it  has  been  held 

inter-alia  that  documents  which  were  required  to  be  proved  in 

accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Qanoon-e-Shahadat 

Order,  1984,  could  not  be  tendered  in  evidence  through  bare 

statement  of  the  counsel  for  a  party  and  got  exhibited  even  if 

there was no objection from the other side. Similarly, in the case 

of  Muhammad  Ashraf  VS  Muhammad  Tahir  Ismail  (2011  MLD 

1848), it has been held as follows:-  

“So  far  as  the  production  of  original  documents  are 
concerned,  under  Article  78  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order, 
1984 without  the proof  of  signature  and  hand writing  of 
person alleged to have signed or written documents cannot 
be taken in evidence. The production of these documents in 
the statement of learned counsel for the plaintiff was not 
permissible under the law.”  
(Emphasis added) 

32. 

In  the  case  of  Jamshed  Ahmed  Khan  Dasti  VS  The  State 

(2013  CLC  1501),  the  appellant  was  convicted  by  the  Sessions 

Judge,  Muzaffargarh, under  Section  82  of  Representation  of  the 

People Act, 1976, and sentenced to 3 years’ imprisonment with a 

fine of Rs.5,000/-. The appellant had been accused of presenting 

a fake educational qualification at the time of contesting general 

elections held in the year 2008. One of the grounds on which the 

conviction was set aside by the Hon'ble Lahore High Court, was 

as follows:-  

“(h)  What happened in the trial of the present case was, that 
the learned counsel representing the complainant has in fact 
appeared in the witness-box and placed on record all the 
exhibited documents, but in spite of that he was formally not 
given  the  status  of  a  witness  the  accused  denying  the 

 
 
17 

C.R.No.112/2016 

prosecution allegations levelled against him was not afforded 
any  opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  said  witness.  If  the 
statement  of  learned  counsel  for  the  complainant  is  not 
considered as a statement of witness, then this is a case of no 
evidence on behalf of the complainant. Even the documents, 
which were inducted in the record do not qualify to be of any 
worth  for  their  inclusion  in  the  evidence  without  some 
permissible mode. Some documents are shown to have been 
certified copies, but when probed as to which authority put a 
certificate on the said documents, it reveals that it was the 
complainant, who certified such documents. The complainant 
had  no  authority whatsoever  under  any  law  to  certify  the 
documents. Most of the documents are private documents. 
Neither their author nor signatory nor custodian were ever 
permitted to be called to appear in evidence to prove the 
existence of such documents.” 

33.  Since  the  petitioner  in  his  evidence  did  not  come  up  with 

any  convincing  evidence  that  he  had  paid  all  the  allotment 

charges etc., for the suit plot, he could not claim that 1/3rd share 

in  the  suit  plot  was  actually  owned  by  him  and  not  Muhammad 

Hanif  in  whose  favour  the  allotment  of  said  share  stood  at  all 

material times. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that 

since  the  suit  plot  was  allotted  as  rehabilitation  benefit,  only 

allotment  charges  were  paid,  and  no  sale  consideration  was 

paid.  This  would  make  the  petitioner’s  case  even  more  doubtful 

since  the  petitioner  in  his  cross-examination  had  deposed  that 

the suit plot was not allotted as compensation by the C.D.A., and 

that he (the petitioner) had paid for the suit plot.   

34.  Registered  Special  Power  of  attorney  dated  15.01.1986 

(Ex.D.1), was executed by the petitioner in favour of  Muhammad 

Hanif,  authorizing  the  latter  to  inter-alia correspond  with  the 

C.D.A. and to execute any document, deed or paper required to 

be signed or executed by the C.D.A. with respect to the suit plot. 

Muhammad  Hanif  was  also  authorized  to  take  possession  of the 

suit  plot  and  to  construct  a  building  thereon  with  the  funds 

provided by the petitioner. A house has been constructed on 10 

marlas  of  the  suit  plot.  Respondents  No.2  and  3  are  residing  in 

the said house. It is common for a sibling living abroad to give a 

power of attorney regarding his property in Pakistan to a sibling 

living in Pakistan. Admittedly, the petitioner had 1/3rd share in the 

suit  plot.  The  mere  fact  that  the  said  power  of  attorney  was  not 

 
 
18 

C.R.No.112/2016 

with respect to 1/3rd share in the suit plot, but the entire suit plot 

would not make the petitioner the owner of the entire suit plot. It 

is  also  an  admitted  position  that  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot  was 

owned  by  Yaqoob  Khan,  and  after his  demise by  his  legal  heirs. 

The said power of attorney makes no mention of Yaqoob Khan’s 

share  in  the  suit  plot.  The  said  power  of  attorney  cannot  be 

construed  as  an  arrangement  between  the  petitioner  and 

Muhammad Hanif as to the latter being a benamidar to the extent 

of 1/3rd share in the suit plot.  

35. 

It  may  also  be  mentioned  that  the  said  power  of  attorney 

was  not  produced  by  the  petitioner  (DW-1)  during  his  evidence. 

Had the petitioner produced this document during his evidence, 

respondent  No.1  would  have  had  the  chance  to  cross-examine 

him.  This  document  was  also  produced  by  the  learned  counsel 

for the petitioner  along with  his statement. The factum  as to the 

execution of the power of attorney is pleaded by the petitioner in 

paragraph 3 of the suit. This assertion was specifically denied by 

respondent  No.1 

in  her  written  statement.  Therefore,  the 

petitioner could not be relieved from the obligation of proving the 

execution  of  the  said  power  of  attorney  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions of the law, even though the same was registered. It is 

well  settled  that  when  the  defendant  denies  the  execution  of  a 

power  of  attorney,  the  burden  shifts  on  to  the  plaintiff  to  prove 

the same in accordance with the provisions of Articles 17 and 79 

of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. Reference in this regard 

may be made to the law laid down in the cases of Mir Shah Nawaz 

Marri VS Sub-registrar, Quetta (2017 MLD 158), Mst. Salma Bibi 

VS  Muhammad  Aslam  (2014  YLR  2481),  Riaz-ul-Haq  Sheikh  VS 

Zulfiqar  Hussain  (2010  CLC  770),  Sardar  Muhammad  VS  Mst. 

Naheed Mehboob Alam (2005 YLR 2108), and Jan Muhammad VS 

Collector, District Jang (2004 CLC 1847). In the case at hand, the 

petitioner did not even produce the said power of attorney when 

his  evidence  was  being  recorded  let  alone  producing  the 

marginal witnesses or a representative from the office of the sub-

registrar  to  prove 

its  execution.  Although  presumption  of 

correctness was attached to a registered document but when its 

 
19 

C.R.No.112/2016 

execution  was  denied  then  the  sanctity  of  said  document  would 

depend  upon  the  quantum  and  quality  of  evidence,  which  is 

lacking in this case.  

36. 

In  the  written  statement  filed  by  C.D.A.  in  the  suit  for 

declaration etc., instituted by the petitioner, it has been pleaded 

that  Muhammad  Hanif  was  the  co-allottee  of  the  suit  plot,  and 

that his legal heirs had not applied for the transfer of his share in 

their  names.  Since  Yaqoob  Khan’s  share  in  the  suit  plot  was 

transferred  to  his  legal  heirs  after  his  demise,  there  is  nothing 

preventing  respondent  No.1  from  applying  to  the  C.D.A.  for 

transferring  her Sharai  share  in  the  1/3rd  share  in  the  suit  plot, 

which was owned by her father, to her. 

37.  Taking  into  consideration  the  cumulative  effect  of  all  the 

facts and circumstances of the present case, the learned Courts 

below  concurrently  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  petitioner 

failed to prove that the purchase of 1/3rd share in the suit plot in 

Muhammad  Hanif’s  name  was  a  benami  transaction.  I  am  in 

complete  agreement  with  the  findings  arrived  at  by  learned 

Courts  below.  It  cannot  be  held  that  the  findings  of  the  courts 

below were perverse or in disregard of the material evidence on 

record. Resultantly, this civil revision petition is dismissed.
