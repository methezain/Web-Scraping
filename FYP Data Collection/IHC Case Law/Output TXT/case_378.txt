Record  transpires  that  on  the  preceding  date 

dates  i.e.  15.11.2021  &  02.12.2021,  none  appeared  on 

behalf  of  the  petitioner  and  today  no  one  entered 

appearance on behalf of the petitioner. It seems that the 

petitioner has lost interest in the instant matter.  

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ  petition 

is 

dismissed for non-prosecution.
