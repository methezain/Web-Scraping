The  sole  grievance  of  the  petitioners

their  family members.

Brief  facts  as  per  contents  of petition  are 

that  the  petitioners  deal  in  the  business  of  real 

estate  and 

that  his  maternal  cousin  namely 

Nauman  Manzoor,  is  nominated 

in  F.l.R  No.17 

dated  15.01.2017  under  Section  392  P.P.C,  and 

F.l.R  No.8  dated  04.01.2017  under  Section  392 

P.P.C,  both  registered  at  Police  Station  Miani, 

District  Sargodha  and  due  to  the  relation  of the 

petitioners  with  Nauman, 

they 

are  being 

harassed  and  threatened;  that on  20.08.2020,  the 

police  officials  arrested  petitioner  No.2 from  his 

office  and  tortured  him  in  order  to  know  the 

whereabouts  of  Nauman  Manzoor,  whereas 

the 

petitioners  have  no  contact  at  all  with  the  said 

Nauman  Manzoor. 

3. 

Report  and  parawise 

comments  were 

called  for from  the  respondents,  which  have  been 

filed, wherein  it  is  stated  that  neither  any  police

arrived  here  nor  the  petitioners  were  summoned 

by  the  police  of  Police  Station  Bhara  Kahu, 

Islamabad. 

4. 

In  view  of  the  above,  this  petition 

is 

disposed  of with  a  direction  to  the  respondents 

not  to  illegally  harass,  blackmail  or  threaten 

the 

petitioners 

in  any  manner  and  to  act  strictly  in 

accordance  with  law.
