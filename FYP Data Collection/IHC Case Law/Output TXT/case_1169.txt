Proceedings 
17.08.2021  Mr.  Sajjad  Haider  Malik,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  order  dated 

26.01.2021,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II/Judge Family-Guardian Court, East-

Islamabad,  whereby 

application 

for 

enhancement of maintenance of minors filed 

by respondent No.1 was allowed.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends 

that 

judgment  and 

decree  regarding  payment  of  maintenance 

was  passed  in  the  year  2006,  wherein 

monthly  maintenance  @  Rs.5,000/-  each 

minor  was  fixed.  The  petitioner  is  regularly 

paying  the  maintenance  according  to  terms 

and  conditions  of  judgment  and  decree 

dated  12.05.2006  passed  by  learned  Family 

Court. Learned counsel further contends that 

respondents  No.1  to  3  have  filed  execution 

petition  and  during  execution  proceedings, 

respondent  No.1  has  filed  an  application  for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
enhancement of maintenance, whereby vide 

impugned  order,  learned  Executing  Court 

has  enhanced  the  maintenance  of  the 

minors  which  is  Rs.5,000/-  each  per  month, 

with 10 % annual increase w.e.f the date of 

filing  of  the  suit  i.e.  06.12.2005.  Learned 

counsel further contends that it is mentioned 

in  the  impugned  order  that  the  petitioner 

was  bound  to  pay  the  maintenance  of  the 

minor  son  at  the  rate  of  Rs.5,000/-  per 

month  till  the  age  of  18  years  and  also  to 

pay  maintenance  of  minor  daughter  at  the 

same  rate  till  her  marriage.  The  dates  of 

birth  of  the  minors  i.e.  02.11.1999  and 

02.11.2001,  mentioned  in  the  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  passed  by  learned 

Court  have  been  crossed  and  according  to 

record  even  minors  are  not  entitled  to  get 

maintenance 

from 

the  petitioner 

as 

mentioned  in  the  impugned  order.  Learned 

counsel  further  contends  that  the  impugned 

order has been passed in violation of the law 

laid down by superior courts of  the country. 

Learned counsel has placed reliance on case 

reported as “2012 SCMR 671”.
