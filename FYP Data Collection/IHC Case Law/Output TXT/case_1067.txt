Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

assailed 

order 

dated 

25.09.2021,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II,  East-Islamabad,  whereby  interim 

maintenance  of  the  minors  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.10,000/-  for  each  minor  per  month  has 

been fixed.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that vide impugned order 

learned  Trial  Court  has 

fixed 

interim 

maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  for 

each  minor  per  month,  which 

is  very 

exorbitant  and  is  not  according  to  financial 

position  of  the  petitioner  and  it  is  also 

against  the  prayer  clause  mentioned  in  the 

main  suit,  whereby  respondent  No.1  herself 

has  prayed  that  maintenance  of  minors  at 

the  rate  of  Rs.7,500/-  for  each  minor  be 

fixed,  whereas  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
has  fixed  the  maintenance  of  the  minors  at 

the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  for  each  minor  per 

month  contrary  to  the  prayer  made  in  the 

suit.  Learned  counsel  further  contends  that 

marriage  between  the  parties  is  still  intact 

and  respondents  No.1  to  6  minors  are 

residing in the house of the petitioner.
