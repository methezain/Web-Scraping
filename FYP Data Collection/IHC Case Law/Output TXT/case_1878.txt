Wajid Nadeem and  inflicting  injuries to him. Benefit of section 382-B, Cr.P.C. was also 

extended to the appellants. 

3. 

Brief  facts  are  that  Muhammad  Azam/complainant  got  recorded  his  statement  to 

the  police  with  the  allegation  that  on  28.09.2009,  he  went  to  Rawalpindi  on  his  car  for 

supply of milk and when he was coming back with Asghar Ali to his village and at about 

8:30  a.m,  when  they  reached  near  Pind  Dayan,  they  suddenly  heard  firing  and  saw  that 

Ilyas s/o Aslam  armed with  Kalashnikov,  Arif s/o Aslam armed with 7  mm,  Rafaqat s/o 

Muhammad  Hussain  armed  with  12  bore  gun,  Nasir  Mehmood  s/o  Muhammad  Hussain 

armed  with  30  bore  pistol,  Faisal  s/o  Muhammad  Hussain  armed  with  Kalashnikov  and 

Zafran s/o Meherban armed with Kalashnikov resorted firing at car No.RIV/1845 of Babar 

Nadeem and others, who were sitting in the said car. Behind the car four motorbike riders 

on two motorcycles were making aerial firing. During the firing, Babar Nadeem, who was 

present on driving seat of car, fled to save himself in injured condition and he was chased 

by accused Faisal, who fired upon him with his Kalashnikov and Babar Nadeem fell down 

on the ground, thereafter accused Rafaqat Hussain fired on him with his 12 bore gun. Due 

to said firing, people gathered at the site and accused Ilyas alongwith his companions fled 

away  on  their  white  colour  Mehran  Car  from  the  scene  while  making  aerial  firing.  The 

four unknown persons, who were present on motorcycles, also decamped  from the place 

of occurrence, who can be identified by Muhammad Azam/complainant and Asghar Ali, if 

seen.  Thereafter,  they  went  to  vehicle  of  Babar  Nadeem  and  found  dead  bodies  of 

Mulazim  Hussain  on  front  seat,  Mukhtar  Hussain  on  back  seat,  nearby  Babar  Nadeem, 

whereas  Wajid  Hussain  and  Matloob  Hussain  were  also  lying  on  the  back  seat  of  the 

vehicle  in  critical  injured  condition.  The  injured  were  taken  to  hospital  by  Asghar  Ali. 

Ilyas  and  his  companions  have  committed  murder  of  three  persons  and  injured  two 

persons in consultation with Muhammad Hussain, whereas the motive of the occurrence is 

old enmity due to murder. On the complaint of Muhammad Azam, above mentioned FIR 

has  been  registered.  After  completion  of  the  investigation,  challan  U/S  173,  Cr.P.C  was 

submitted  before  the  Trial  Court,  and  learned  trial  Court  convicted  and  sentenced  the 

appellants through the impugned judgment.

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  have  contended  that  the  conviction  is  based 

upon  misreading  and  non-reading  of  evidence  and  the  appraisement  of  circumstances 

adopted by  learned Trial Court is not sustainable  as the evidence  is  insufficient to prove 

the guilt of the appellants; that the occurrence took place in densely populated area but no 

independent person/witness was produced in the Trial from the vicinity to substantiate the 

contention of the complainant; that presence of the complainant at the place of occurrence 

is doubtful, even no specific injury has been attributed to appellant Nasir Mehmood; that 

the I.O sent weapon of offence to FSL with delay and the witnesses were inimical, whose 

statements  could  not  be  corroborated  without  independent  source,  hence,  their  evidence 

has to be discredited; that the witnesses have improved their stance and there are a lot of 

contradictions and additions in material facts, which shake the credibility of the witnesses 

qua their bonafide.  

5. 

Conversely, learned counsel for the complainant has contended that the appellants 

have  been  nominated  with  specific  role  of  committing  murder  of  three  innocent  persons 

and  injuring  two  witnesses,  which  has  been  corroborated  through  testimony  of  injured 

P.W.16;  that  it  was  pre-planned  murder,  which  was  committed  in  gruesome  and  brutal 

manner and the Trial Court has rightly convicted the appellants and awarded them death 

sentence;  that  the  contradictions  referred  by  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  amongst 

the statements of the witnesses are minor and the same do not affect material facts of the 

case and the same  have  no bearing on  merits of the case; that there  is  no discrepancy  in 

the ocular account and the appellants were identified in proper manner; that the motive is 

established  from  the  record;  that  non-matching  of  empties  recovered  from  the  place  of 

occurrence with the weapon of offence recovered from the accused is of little significance 

as  the  prosecution  case  is  based  upon  ocular  account  furnished  by  one  injured  P.W.16, 

whose  presence  at  the  place  of  occurrence  is  beyond  any  shadow  of  doubt;  that  car  P.1 

produced before the Court during the trial,  in which two persons  lost their  lives and two 

got  injured,  clearly  revealed  that  it  had  broken  windscreen  and  blood  stained  seats, 

therefore, all the ingredients of conviction are on record and chain of evidence proves that 

the appellants alongwith others committed gruesome murder of three innocent persons and 

got injured two persons.

6. 

We have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and gone through 

the record with invaluable assistance of learned counsel for the parties. 

7. 

From  perusal  of  the  record,  it  has  been  observed  that  complainant  Muhammad 

Azam, got lodged the complaint to SHO, P.S Koral, Islamabad with the allegations that he 

is  milk  seller  and  resident  of  Darwala,  Islamabad,  whereas  on  28.09.2009  he  went  to 

Rawalpindi early in the morning in his vehicle to sell milk and after selling the milk, when 

he alongwith Asghar Ali s/o Wali Muhammad was coming back to his village and at about 

8:30  a.m,  when  they  reached  near  Pind  Dayan,  they  suddenly  heard  firing  and  saw  that 

accused Muhammad Ilyas armed with Kalashnikov, Arif armed with 7mm, Rafaqat armed 

with .12 bore gun, Nasir armed with .30 bore pistol, Faisal armed with  Kalashnikov and 

Zafran  armed  with  Kalashnikov  were  firing  on  the  vehicle  RIV/1845  of  Babar  Nadeem, 

whereas  on  the  back  side  of  the  vehicle  four  persons  on  two  motorcycles  were  also 

making  aerial  firing,  Babar  Nadeem,  who  was  present  on  the  driving  seat  in  injured 

condition fled to save his life but Faisal accused chased him and fired upon him from his 

Kalashnikov,  whereby  Babar  Nadeem  fell  down  on  the  ground.  Accused  Rafaqat,  who 

was armed with 12 bore gun, also resorted to firing upon Babar Nadeem. During the said 

firing,  people  gathered  at  the  site  and  accused  Muhammad  Ilyas  alongwith  companions 

decamped from the site on white Mehran Car while making aerial firing and similarly the 

four motorcycle riders also fled away from the scene, who can be identified, if seen. After 

the said incident, the complainant went to the said vehicle and found that on the front seat 

Mulazim Hussain  and on the back seat Mukhtar Hussain  were  lying dead, whereas dead 

body of Babar Nadeem was lying at some distance. Wajid Hussain and Matloob Hussain 

were seriously injured lying on the back seat of the car, who were shifted to the hospital 

by  Asghar  Ali.  Muhammad  Ilyas  and  his  companions  have  committed  murder  of  three 

innocent  persons  and  injured  two  persons  in  consultation  with  Muhammad  Hussain  s/o 

Khan Muhammad, whereas motive of the occurrence is enmity due to a murder case. 

8. 

The  complaint  was  converted 

into  FIR  No.271,  dated  28.09.2009,  U/S 

302/324/148/149/109/337-A(i)/337-F(v)/337-F(i),  PPC,  P.S  Koral,  Islamabad/Exh.P.T.

S.I/SHO/P.W.2 alongwith Shafaqat Ullah, Sabir Masih, and Muhammad Asif, constables

acknowledged  that  there  was  no  blackening  on  all  the  injuries  of  deceased  Mukhtar 

Hussain. He further stated that he cannot tell as to what kind of weapon was used as he is 

not  ballistic  expert  of  weapon  nor  he  is  able  to  tell  exact  distance  of  fire-arms  through 

which injuries were caused. He further stated that entry wounds were of different size and 

it depends upon the weapons as well as entry in the tissues of the body. He further stated

37. 

The prosecution produced  Asif Nadeem/constable posted at Police Station  Koral,

clothes were without parcel.  

38. 

The prosecution produced Tariq Mehmood/ASI as PW.8, posted as Reader SDPO 

Rural  Circle,  Islamabad,  who  stated  that  on  28.09.2009,  he  was  posted  at  P.S  Koral,

for depositing in the Forensic Science Agency, Lahore. He further stated that his statement 

U/S 161, Cr.P.C was recorded by the I.O on 19.10.2009. 

39. 

The prosecution again produced Malik  Amir Shahzad/Draftsman as P.W.13, who 

stated  that  on  30.09.2009  Shoukat  Ali,  S.I  went  to  the  place  of  occurrence  and  on  the 

pointation of complainant Muhammad Azam, he took rough notes and on 05.10.2009, he 

prepared  scaled  site  plan.  During  the  cross-examination,  P.W.13  acknowledged  that  he 

had not seen the site plan prepared by the police. He stated that the distance between point 

No.1 and point No.3 is 38 feet, whereas the distance between point No.1 and point No.5 is 

22  feet  and  the  distance  between  point  No.5  and  point  No.3  is  approximately  60  feet,

41. 

In  view  of  above  background,  this  Court  has  gone  through  the  entire  evidence 

brought on record from all  angles and  it appears that  alleged  incident of  murder of three 

deceased  persons  Mukhtar  aged  40  years,  Babar  Nadeem  aged  35  years  and  Mulazim 

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Jail Appeal No.192/2015, Jail Appeal No.202/2015 & Murder Reference No.17/2015                       Page | 23 

Hussain aged 50 years, who allegedly received fire arm injuries at the hands of appellants 

Rafaqat  Hussain  and  Nasir  Mehmood  and their  co-accused.  In these  jail  appeals  and  the 

murder  reference,  we  have  confined  ourselves  to  the  role  of  appellants  Rafaqat  Hussain 

and Nasir Mehmood.  

42. 

As per complaint/Exh.PZ, complainant Muhammad Azam is milk seller, who after 

selling milk at Raja Bazar Rawalpindi was coming to his village Darwala on Suzuki Pick 

up and when he reached near Pind Dayan, he heard sound of firing and saw that accused 

Muhammad  Ilyas  armed  with  Kalashnikov,  Arif  armed  with  7  mm  rifle,  Rafaqat  armed 

with  12  bore  gun,  Nasir  armed  with  .30  bore  pistol,  Faisal  and  Zafran  armed  with 

Kalashnikovs  were  firing  on  car  No.RIV/1845  of    Babar  Nadeem,  in  which  Mulazim 

Hussain,  Mukhtar  Hussain,  Matloob  Hussain,  Wajid  Hussain  and  Babar  Nadeem  were 

sitting  and  two  motorcycles  with  two  riders  each  on  rear  of  the  car  were  also  making 

aerial firing.  

43. 

The  above  referred  complaint  was  produced  in  evidence  as  Exh.PZ  but 

surprisingly complainant Muhammad Azam was not produced as a witness in this case, 

therefore, version narrated in the complaint/Exh.PZ as well as in the FIR/Exh.PD has not 

been proved by the prosecution and the same cannot be considered for the decision of the 

appeals  and  the  murder  reference.  As  per  complaint/Exh.PZ,  the  injured  Wajid  Hussain 

and Matloob Hussain, who were sitting on the back seat of the vehicle were shifted to the 

hospital  through  Asghar  Ali  as  narrated  by  the  complainant  Muhammad  Azam  in  the 

following manner:-

44. 

The  above  referred  portion  of  the  complaint  has  not  been  proved  as  Asghar  Ali 

was  also  not  produced  by  the  prosecution  as  a  witness  during  the  trial,  who  shiftd  the 

injured to the hospital and as such the prosecution could  not prove  as to who shifted the 

injured to the hospital.  

45. 

Another  important  aspect  of  this  case  is  non-appearance  of  one  of  the  injured 

person namely Wajid Nadeem, who alleged got injured in the incident and was treated by

Dr. Abdul Ghafoor/P.W.11 at Benazir Bhutto Hospital Rawalpindi and the relevant injury 

statement/Exh.PM  and  MLR/Exh.PU  have  also  been  brought  on  record  but  surprisingly 

the  said  witness  was  not  produced  by  the  prosecution,  which  clearly  establishes  that the 

best evidence has been withheld and as such the negative presumption comes on record in 

terms of article 129(g) of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, however, MLR/Exh.PU clearly 

reveals  that  Wajid  Nadeem  injured  was  examined  by  Dr.  Abdul  Ghafoor/P.W.11  on 

28.09.2009  at  12:45  p.m,  whereas  the  alleged  incident  took  place  at  8:30  a.m  in  the 

morning, which clearly establishes delay of 4½ hours in the treatment of the injured Wajid 

Nadeem.  The  only  person,  who  has  taken  the  responsibility  to  prove  the  case  of  the 

prosecution  is  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16,  who  recorded  his  first  statement  before 

the  police  on  29.09.2009  with  delay  of  one  day  despite  the  fact  that  Dr.  Abdul 

Ghafoor/P.W.11 acknowledged that:- 

“The injured was conscious and oriented.” 

Even otherwise, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor/P.W.11 stated before the Court that: 

“Injured was observed by me at 12:45 pm.” 

Such delay on part of the prosecution, which has not been explained,  is  fatal as the only 

prosecution  witness,  who  has  to  share  the  responsibility  to  prove  the  prosecution  case 

reached in the hospital with delay of 4½ hours and his first statement was recorded on the 

second  day  of  the  incident  although  he  was  well  oriented  and  conscious  and  this  fact 

establishes  consultation  and  deliberation  with  other  persons  of  the  complainant  party  to 

involve different persons of accused side in the case. Reliance is placed upon 2010 SCMR 

584 (Rahat Ali VS The State) and 2017 SCMR 486 (Muhammad Asif VS The State). 

46. 

As  per  statement  of  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16,  the  appellants  and  their 

co-accused were armed in the following manner:- 

(i)    Accused Muhammad Ilyas armed with Kalashnikov. 

(ii)   Accused Arif armed with 7mm rifle. 

(iii) Accused Rafaqat armed with 12 bore gun. 

(iv) Accused Nasir armed with .30 bore pistol. 

(v) Accused Faisal and Zafran armed with KalashnikoVS 

Jail Appeal No.192/2015, Jail Appeal No.202/2015 & Murder Reference No.17/2015                       Page | 25 

47. 

The  above  referred  details  given  by  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  are  with 

generalized role in the following manner:- 

“thereafter  all  of  them  started  indiscriminate  firing.  After 
sustaining  injuries  Babar  Nadeem  attempted  to  flee  from  the 
place of occurrence but Faisal fired at him with Kalashnikov and 
thereafter  Rafaqat  accused  also  fired  upon  him  with  his  rife  12 
bore.  Babar  Nadeem,  Mulazim  Hussain  &  Mukhtar  Hussain 
succumbed to the injuries at the site.” 

48. 

The  above  referred  role  gives  an  impression  that  all  of  the  accused  including 

appellants resorted to indiscriminate firing, however, one of the accused Rafaqat appellant 

in  present  case  has  been  attributed  role  of  single  fire  shot  of  12  bore  gun  upon  the 

deceased  Babar  Nadeem,  therefore,  this  Court  has  gone  through  the  evidence  of  Dr. 

Farrukh Kamal/P.W.1, who conducted post mortem of deceased Babar Nadeem and as per 

his evidence injury No.1 is:- 

“entry  wound  8  cm  x  5  cm multiple  entry  wounds  right  mandible 
region with fracture mandible and lower jaw.” 

49. 

The  above  referred  injury,  if  seen  in  the  light  of  description  given  by  injured 

Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  qua  the  role  of  appellant  Rafaqat,  the  same  is  contrary  to  the 

weapon  used  as  Dr.  Farrukh  Kamal/P.W.1  has  not referred  any  pellet  injury  rather  used 

the  term  “multiple  entry  wounds”  as the  same  has  to  be  seen  in  juxta  position  with  the 

description given by P.W.1 while referring injury No.2 as “exit wound 1.5 c.m x 1.5 cm 

irregular inverted margins occipital region on neck.” The said injury is not in line with 

the shot gun injury  rather gives an  impression of other kind of weapon  i.e. Kakashnikov 

AK-47,  therefore,  statement  of  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  is  not  in  line  with 

medical evidence, therefore, the same could not be believed.  

50.  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  has  given  particular  details  of  his  own  injury  and 

attributed  the  same  to  Muhammad  Ilyas  co-accused  but  could  not  explain  the  role  of 

appellant Nasir Mehmood, which could be considered in generalize manner, however, 

to that effect benefit of doubt creates on the record.  

51. 

The  above  referred  preposition  has  to  be  seen  in  the  light  of  judgment  reported  as 

1996 SCMR 1411 (Muhammad Hayat and another VS The State), wherein it was held that:- 

“injured eye witnesses---stamp of fire arm injury on the person of 
prosecution  witnesses  is  not  per-se  tantamount  to  A  stamp  of 
credence on their testimony” 

 
 
 
Jail Appeal No.192/2015, Jail Appeal No.202/2015 & Murder Reference No.17/2015                       Page | 26 

Similar  view  was  also  taken  in  2011  SCMR  323  (Amin  Ali  and  another  VS  The 

State) that: 

“presence  of  injured  witnesses  cannot  be  doubted  at  place  of 
incident merely because they had injuries on their person does not 
stamp them to truthful witnesses.” 

52. 

The other important factor, which creates serious doubt in the entire case is delay 

in recording of first statement U/S 161,Cr.P.C of injured Matloob Hussain/P.W.16, on the 

second  day  of  incident  without,  which  has  not  been  explained  in  any  manner,  especially 

when  the  injured  was  well  conscious  and  oriented  as  per  statement  of  Dr.  Abdul 

Ghafoor/P.W.11.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2010  SCMR  584  (Rahat  Ali  VS  The  State), 

wherein it was held that: 

“delayed examination of  witnesses could effect delay in recording 
of  statement  of  witness  by  police  without  furnishing  plausible 
reason  is  fatal  to  the  prosecution  case  and  statement  of  such 
witness is not to be relied upon.” 

Similar view has also been taken in the recent judgment of Apex Court  2017 SCMR 486 

(Muhammad Asif VS The State), wherein it has been held that:- 

“even one or two days un-explained delay in recording statements 
of the eye witnesses would be fatal and testimony of such witnesses 
could not be safely relied upon.” 

53. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  tried  to  convince  this  Court  with  the  help  of 

application for recording statement of the injured/Exh.PP,  which was produced by Arshad 

Ali, S.I/P.W.6 in evidence during his testimony and stated that the doctor gave his opinion 

that the injured is not fit for statement. We have gone through the said application as well 

as 

the  note  written  by  Dr.  Abdul  Ghafoor,  CMO,  Benazir  Bhutto  Hospital, 

Rawalpindi/P.W.11  and  the  said  application  has  been  seen  in  the  light  of  statement  of 

Dr.Abdul  Ghafoor/P.W.11,  who  categorically  stated  in  his  cross-examination  that  “the 

injured  was  conscious  and  oriented”,  hence,  the  prosecution  has  failed  to  justify  the 

reason of recording of statement of injured Matloob Hussain/P.W.16 with delay as such 

they have  brought specific reasons, which has been denied by the concerned doctor 

in his testimony, therefore, the note written on the application Exh.PP has no legal worth 

to be considered for any purpose in favour of the prosecution.

54. 

The  statement  of  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  has  to  be  taken  into  account 

with due care and caution as he is related witness to the deceased as well as other injured 

persons. During cross-examination, Matloob Hussain stated that he got injured due to fire 

shot  of  accused  Arif  Proclaimed  Offender.  He  also  stated  during  cross-examination  that  

appellant Rafaqat, who was present in the hut on the left side of the car  came out of the 

hut  and  made  firing  but  surprisingly  in  examination  in  chief,  he  stated  that  appellant 

Rafaqat fired upon Babar Nadeem, when he attempted to flee from the place of occurrence 

with his 12 bore rifle but as per statement of Matloob Hussain as well as site plan, Babar 

Nadeem deceased was sitting on driving seat and fled from the said position on the right 

side of the vehicle, therefore, it was not possible for the appellant, who was standing on 

the  left  side  of  the  vehicle  to  go  around  the  vehicle  and  fire  upon  the  deceased  Babar 

Nadeem  and  in  such  eventuality  the  ocular  account  given  by  Matloob  Hussain/P.W16  is 

contrary  to  the  medical  evidence.  Even  otherwise,  the  inquest  report/Exh.PKK  prepared 

by the I.O regarding Babar Nadeem on the alleged day of occurrence reveals injury No.1 

in column No.10 as under:-

bore  cartridge)  from  the  said  injury  as  the  12  bore  cartridge  is  comprising  of  100s  of 

pellets  including  wad  and  it  is  usually  seen  in  the  injury  of  12  bore  shot  gun  with  close 

range.  The  wad  has  to  be  recovered  from  the  injury,  which  is  not  available  in  this  case, 

therefore,  ocular  account  given  by  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  is  contrary  to  the  technical 

evidence of use of weapon. In such like eventuality, we are fortified with the view taken 

in 1999 SCMR 172 (Muhammad Aslam Khan VS The State), wherein it was held that:- 

“The  medical  evidence  in  this  case  also  falsifies  the  ocular 
account. The presence of wad in the body of the deceased proves it 
beyond any shadow of doubt that he was fired from a close range.” 

55. 

In view of above authoritative judgment of Apex Court, it is clear that any injury 

caused by 12 bore gun with close range must result into recovery of wad from the body of 

the  deceased  or  the  injured  but  in  this  case,  the  role  defined  by  injured  Matloob 

Hussain/P.W.16, in which appellant Rafaqat Hussain fired with his 12 bore gun with close 

range  could  not  be  justified  through  the  medical  evidence.  Even  otherwise,  blackening 

around the wound is found, if a weapon like shot gun is discharged from a distance of not

more  than  three  feet  and  the  revolver  or  pistol  is  discharged  within  about  two  feet  as 

referred in Modi’s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. Reliance  is placed upon  1995 

SCMR 610 (Mir Muhammad VS The State), wherein it was held that:- 

“Blackening  of  wound---Blackening  around  wound  is  found,  if  a 
fire-arm  like  shot-gun  is  discharged  from  a  distance  of  not  more 
than  3  feet  and  a  revolver  or  pistol  is  discharged  within  about  2 
feet.” 

Similar  view was also taken  in  2007  SCMR  1812  (Barkat  Ali  VS  Muhammad  Asif  and 

others), wherein it was held that:- 

“Blackening  on  dead  body  would  appear  in  case  deceased 
received injuries from a distance of four feet.” 

56. 

The  above  referred  details  of  ocular  and  medical  evidence  have  persuaded  this 

Court  to  consider  evidence  of  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W.16  in  the  light  of  law  laid 

down  by  the  Apex  Court  regarding  related,  inimical  and  interested  witnesses,  which 

requires  strong  corroboration.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  1999  SCMR  1030  (Muhammad 

Irshad and another VS The State), wherein it was held that:- 

“Where a witness is interested and also inimical and is thus likely 
to falsely  implicate  one  or  other  accused,  it  was  essential  to  seek 
independent corroboration regarding each one of other accused.” 

Similar, view was taken in 1980 SCMR 979 (Hazoor Bakhsh VS Waddon and 3 others) 

& PLD 1985 Supreme Court 11 (Ghulam Sikandar and another VS Mamaraz Khan and 

others).  In  view  of  above  circumstances,  we  are  also  of  the  view  that  PW.16  Matloob 

Hussain  is  not  truthful  witness  as  his  statement  is  contrary  to  the  medical  as  well  as 

technical  evidence  of  firearm,  even  otherwise,  he  is  related,  inimical  and  interested 

witness whose statement has not been corroborated with any other independent source or 

witness.  Similarly,  he  could  not  explain  the  usage  of  specific  weapon  which  caused 

murder of Mulazim Hussain and Mukhtar Hussain deceased sitting on the  front and rear 

seat of the car, especially when both the deceased died due to firearm injuries received on 

their left side and not from the front.  

57. 

Lastly,  we  have  gone  through  the  evidence  of  recovery  of  12  bore  repeater  gun, 

which was recovered from appellant Rafaqat Hussain on 29.05.2014 vide recovery memo 

Exh.PBBB and as per the said recovery memo, the appellant while on physical remand got

recovered  the  said  weapon  from  Haren  Maira  Road  near  Darwala  Chowk,  Islamabad  in 

the following manner:-

The  said  recovery  memo  was  prepared  by  Shoukat  S.I/P.W.19,  who  stated  before  the 

Court  that  he  sent  the  parcels  of  repeater  12  bore  and  pistol  to  Forensic  Science 

Laboratory  on  30.06.2014  and  he  also  acknowledged  that  he  dispatched  the  empties 

recovered on  28.09.2009 to  FSL, Islamabad  in  the  year  2014  for the  second time  but  he 

could  not  explain  as  to  why  he  waited  for  five  years  and  did  not  dispatch  the  crime 

empties. In such like eventuality the recoveries of weapon of 12 bore repeater gun and 30 

bore pistol are in consequential. Reliance is placed upon 2007 SCMR 1812 (Barkat Ali VS 

Muhammad Asif and others), wherein it was held that:- 

“The  learned  High  Court  had  also  examined  the  evidence  on 
record  qua  the  recoveries  and  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the 
empties  recovered  from  the  spot  did  not  tally  with  the  weapon 
recovered  at  the  instance  of  Muhammad  Asif  respondent  whereas 
according to the report of Forensic Science Laboratory (F.S.L) .12 
bore  empties  recovered  from  the  spot  matched  with  the  gun 
allegedly recovered at the instance of Shabbir respondent on 5-11-
2002 yet no relevance can be placed on the report on the ground 
that according to P.Ws Shabbir was appeared with a rifle and not 
with a gun and that the empties were received in the F.S.L on 29-
11-2002  i.e.  after  one  month  and  10  days  of  the  occurrence  and 
after  24  days  of  the  recovery  of  the  weapon.  There  is  no 
explanation as to why the empties  were not sent to the laboratory 
soon after their recovery.” 

58.  We  have  also  gone  through  the  report/Exh.PKKK  of  National  Forensic  Science 

Agency  produced  by  the  prosecution,  through  which  recovered  four  empties  of  12  bore 

gun were tested but the same did not match with the tested cartridges, however, the pistol 

30  bore  recovered  from  appellant  Nasir  Mehmood  through  recovery  memo/Exh.PEEE 

matched with the crime empties but the same has no evidentiary value as there is delay of 

five years in sending the weapon alongwith fire empties which has not been explained by 

the prosecution. Even otherwise, .30 bore pistol allegedly recovered from appellant Nasir 

Mehmood was also recovered in the following manner:-

The  said  recovery  also  effected  on  29.05.2014  by  Shaukat  S.I/P.W.19,  therefore,  in  the 

light of  judgment  referred  above, the  recoveries  are  inconsequential  and  even  otherwise, 

the  recoveries  were  made  from  main  road,  which  is  an  open  place  and  accessible  to 

everyone  and  it  is  not  possible  that  weapons  of  offence  could  be  concealed  for  5  years 

near the main road.  

59.  We  have  not  seen  any  element  of  vicarious  liability  to  the  extent  of  appellants 

Rafaqat Hussain and Nasir Mehmood in the alleged crime rather the entire case set up by 

the  prosecution  through  injured  Matloob  Hussain/P.W16  is  result  of  concoction, 

fabrication,  consultation  and  the  delay  in  lodging  of  FIR  has  not  been  explained  in  this 

case,  even  the  most  important  witnesses  namely,  Muhammad  Azam  complainant,  Wajid 

Nadeem second injured P.W and Asghar Ali eye witness, who allegedly took the  injured 

to  the  Benazir  Bhutto  Hospital  Rawalpindi  was  not  produced,  which  give  an  overall 

impression that the prosecution  has suppressed  material  facts and  if they produced those 

witnesses, their evidence might comes against the prosecution case and their evidence has 

been withheld  in terms of Article 129(g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, therefore, 

adverse inference is drawn.  

60. 

The  motive  set  up  in  this  case,  if  admitted,  could  affect  both  sides  as  it  is 

considered  to  be  double  edge  weapon  mainly  on  the  ground  that  the  complainant  party 

was  heading  towards  District  Courts,  Islamabad  in  connection  with  murder  case  of  the 

brother  (Makhdoom)  of  Muhammad  Ilyas  co-accused,  therefore,  false  implication  of 

innocent persons cannot be ruled out. No independent witness has  been produced by the 

prosecution despite availability of the witnesses on the place of occurrence and the overall 

evidence of  injured Matloob Hussain/P.W.16  is not confidence  inspiring to the extent of 

murder of deceased Babar Nadeem and even he did not utter a single word as to how fire-

arm  injury  was  caused  to  Mulazim  Hussain  and  Mukhtar  Hussain  deceased,  who  were 

sitting  on the  front  seat  and  rear  seat of  the  same  vehicle  and  received  the  injuries  from 

different angles. 

61. 

Lastly, the entire evidence  is silent as to how and when police was  informed and 

who  informed  the  police  and  the  delay  of  4  ½  hours  in  reaching  the  hospital  is 

unexplained. Even otherwise, there is no explanation on record as to why the injured PWs 

Jail Appeal No.192/2015, Jail Appeal No.202/2015 & Murder Reference No.17/2015                       Page | 31 

were  taken  to  Benazir  Bhutto  Hospital,  Rawalpindi  and  three  deceased  were  taken  to 

PIMS Hospital Islamabad and as to who selected the injured P.Ws among the deceased to 

be taken to the hospital. This entire background creates serious doubt in the mode, manner 

and  description  of  the  accused  persons  and  it  is  settled  principle  of  law  that  benefit  of 

slightest doubt must be extended in favour of the accused. 

62. 

In view of above discussion, the instant Jail Appeal No.192/2015 (Nasir Mehmood  

VS  The  State.)  as  well  as  Jail  Appeal  No.202/2015  (Rafaqat  Hussain    VS  The  State)  are 

allowed and Murder Reference No.17/2015 (The State VS Rafaqat Hussain and another) is 

answered in negative. Appellants Nasir Mehmood and Rafaqat Hussain are acquitted from 

the charges and they be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.
