Order with signature of Judge and that of parties 
or counsel where necessary.  

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  at  the  very 

outset  contends  that  he  intends  to  withdraw  instant  writ 

petition,  as  he  has  inadvertently  filed  the  same  against 

the  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court  against  the  petitioner  to  the  extent  of 

maintenance  of  the  minor/Taj  Meer  only,  therefore,  he 

intends  to  file  regular  appeal  before  the  District  Judge, 

Islamabad accordingly.  

2.   

Be  that  as  it  may,  instant  writ  petition  stands 

dismissed,  as  withdrawn  with  the  observation  that  the 

petitioner  may  approach 

learned  District  Court 

for 

redressal of his grievance, if so advised.
