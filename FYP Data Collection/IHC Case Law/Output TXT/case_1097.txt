Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
14.10.2021  Mr.  Ashiq  Hussain  Tarar,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner has called in question order dated 

04.09.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

Court  /  Guardian  Court,  West-Islamabad, 

whereby  interim  maintenance  of  the  minor 

has been fixed at the rate of Rs.15,000/- per 

month. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, 

contends 

that 

amount 

of 

maintenance  of  minor  at 

the  rate  of 

Rs.15000/-  per  month  is  not  according  to 

financial  status  of 

the  petitioner, 

the 

petitioner  is  serving  in  a  private  company 

and his monthly salary is Rs.45,000/- and he 

is  unable  to  pay  such  a  huge  amount  as 

maintenance  to  the  minor.  Learned  counsel 

has  placed  reliance  on  cases  reported  as 

“Muhammad Khalid Javeed v. Mst. Shahida 

Parveen and 4 others”  (2007  YLR  1366) 

and  “Makhdoom Ali v. Mst. Razia Sultana 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and others”  (2007  MLD  41)  and  prayed 

that  the  impugned  order  is  liable  to  be  set-

aside  and  interim  maintenance  of  minor  be 

fixed  according  to  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner.
