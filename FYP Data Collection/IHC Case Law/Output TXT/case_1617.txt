Mr. Ahmad  Sher  Gondal,  Advocate  for  petitioner, 
Mr. Muhammad  Bilal  Ibrahim,  State  Counsel, 
Ali  Kamran  ASI with  record. 

This 

is  post-arrest  bail  petition  by 

accused-petitioner  (Azam  Ali)  in  FIR  No.  437, 

dated  26.12.2019,  under  Sections  381,  411/34 

PPC, Police Station Shalimar, Islamabad. 

2. 

According  to  FIR, on 25.12.2019, when the 

complainant  along  with  his family  went  to  Faisal 

Masjid  in  connection  with  Nikah  ceremony  of 

close  relative,  his  maid  Naheed  Bibi  and  her 

husband Azam Ali  (present  petitioner)  stolen  an 

amount  of  Rs.510,000/-  and  53 

tolas  gold 

ornaments from his house. Hence, this FIR. 

3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner  contends 

that  recovery  as  alleged  contains  no  particular 

that  whether  the  same was  recovered  from  the 

present  petitioner  or otherwise;  that  co-accused 

Ardish  Ali  has  been  declared  innocent  by  the 

local  police  while  co-accused  Naheed  Bibi  has 

already  been  extended  bail;  that  the  offences 

alleged  do  not  fall  within  prohibitory  clause  of 

Section  497  of  Cr.P.C.  Learned  counsel  has 

placed  reliance  upon case laws reported  as PLO 

2017 Supreme Court  733: 2009 SCMR 1488 and 

2012 SCMR 573 in support of his contention. 

Criminal  Misc.  No.  726-B/  2020 

-2- 

Further  contends  that  the  recovery  as 

alleged  has  been  made  on  the  day  when  the 

petitioner  was arrested  i.e. 05.03.2020. 

4. 

Notices  were  issued  to  the  respondent 

No.2/complainant, wherein  he submitted  through 

Investigation  Officer  that  he is  not  interested  to 

engage a private  counsel and consented that  his 

case be argued by the State Counsel. 

5.  On the  other  hand,  learned  State  Counsel 

argued  that  major  portion  of  stolen  articles  has 

been  recovered  on  the  pointation  of  petitioner; 

that  petitioner  is  previous  non-convict  and  non 

record  holder. 

6. 

7. 

Arguments heard, record  perused. 

As  per  available  record,  petitioner  has 

been booked in the  instant  FIR on the  allegation 

set-forth  by  the  respondent  No.2/complainant 

whereas  amongst  the  others  certain  articles 

were  allegedly  stolen  by  the  present  petitioner 

being house servant. It is yet to be determined as 

to  whether  ornaments  were  stolen  by  the 

petitioner  or the same were  only recovered from 

his possession. In this  respect  reliance  is placed 

on  2017  YLR Nots  5 (Peshawar)  {Abdul  Wahsed 

VS  The state  and  another).  wherein  it  is  held 

that:- 

"Recovery of case amount of Rs.41.0301- from 
his possession. It  is yet  to be seen at  the trial 
that  whether  the  amount  allegedly  recovered 
from  possession  of  the  petitioner 
is  stolen 
amount  or  otherwise.  From  the  available 
record,  the petitioner  can be charged  with an 
offence  under  Section  411  PPC, 
the 
punishment  of  which  does  not  fall  within  the 
prohibitory  clause  of  section  497  Cr.P.C. 
Moreover, investigation in the case is complete 
and  the petitioner  is  no more  required  by  the 
local police  for  further  investigation. All  these 
factors,  on  tentative  assessment,  make  the 

Criminal  Misc.  No.  726-B/  2020 

-3- 

case of petitioner  one of further  inquiry  entitle 
him for the grant  of bail. 11 

8. 

In  case  reported  as  2009  YLR 2055 

(Muhammad Igbal VS  The State},  Hon'ble Lahore 

High  Court,  Lahore  in  same  nature  of  offence 

held that  no source of theft  was mentioned in the 

FIR and while making tentative  assessment of the 

material  available  on  record,  Court  came to  the 

conclusion  that  case  against  the  petitioner  is of 

further  inquiry  and  bail  was  granted.  In another 

case reported  as  1994 PCr.LJ  734 {Hafiz Zameer 

Hussain  VS The State}, it is held that:- 

''Articles  recovered  from  the  applicant  were 
not got  identified  in a regular  test identification 
parade  of  articles  before  a  Magistrate.  This 
being  the  position,  at  the  most  the  applicant 
can be said to be found  in possession  of some 
property  which  is  alleged  to  be  stolen  for 
which  the  applicant  will  be  liable  at  the  most 
under section  411, P. P. C." 

9.  Offences  levelled  in  the  FIR  against  the 

present  petitioner  do  not 

fall  within 

the 

prohibitory  clause.  In  this  respect  reliance  is 

placed  on 2019 SCMR 1152 (Arsalan  Maslh and 

other  VS The state  and other),  wherein  it is held 

that:- 

"So  far  offence  under  Sections  380  and  411 
PPC are concerned  both  these offences  do not 
fall  within  the prohibition  contained  in  section 
497, Cr.P.C. and in such like cases bail is a rule 
and  refusal  is  an  exception.  The  exceptions 
mentioned  in  the  case  of  Tariq  Bashir  and  5 
others  V  The State  {PLD1998 Sc  34}  are  not 
attracted  to the case of petitioner  No.2 as he is 
previously  non-convict  and  his  involvement  in 
another  case  of  similar  nature  without  any 
conviction  could  not be a reason  for  refusal  of 
bail  especially  when such  case  was registered 
after  the registration  of the present  case. 11 

10. 

Challan  has  been  submitted  in  the 

Court  and petitioner  is no more  required  for  the 

Criminal  Misc.  No.  726-B/  2020 

-4- 

purpose  of  investigation  as  no  useful  purpose 

would be served by putting  him behind the bars. 

11. 

In another case reported  as 2020 MLD 158 

(Peshawar)  {Karamat Ullah  VS  The State and 

another), it is held as:- 

''Even otherwise,  the offences  with which the 
petitioner  is  charged  do  not  fall  within  the 
prohibitory  limb  of Section  49 7,  Cr.P. C.  and 
in such like cases grant  of bail is a rule  while 
its  refusal  is  an  exception.  In  this  respect 
reliance  can  be  placed  on  the  case  law 
reported  as  Muhammad  Tanveer  VS  The 
State  PLO 2017 SC  733, Arsalan  Maslh and 
others  VS  The State.  2019  SCMR 1152 and 
Abdul  Waheed  V.  The  State  and  another. 
2017  YLR  Note  5  {Peshawar  (0./.  Khan 
Bench}.  In  my  view  case  of petitioner  does 
not fall within the exceptions." 

12. 

Consequently, the  instant  bail  petition  is 

accepted,  petitioner  (Azam  Ali) 

is  admitted  to 

post-arrest  bail  subject  to  furnishing  bail  bonds 
in the sum of Rs.500.000/- (Rupees Ste~)  with 
one surety  in the  like  amount to  the  satisfaction 

of the learned Trial Court. 

13. 

Needless to  mention  that  above  is  only 

tentative  assessment for  the  purpose  of  instant 

bail  petition  only  and  shall  not  effect/influence 

trial  of the case in any manner.
