Through 

the 

instant 

petition, 

the 

accused/petitioner,  Javeria Afridi  daughter of Salah 

ud  Din  Afridi,  seeks  pre-arrest  bail  in  case  FIR 

No.37, dated 24.01.2020, under  Section 6 (1) (c) of 

the Passport Act,  1974, registered  at Police Station 

FIA/AHTC, Islamabad. 

2. 

Earlier  ad-interim  pre-arrest  bail granted 

to  the  petitioner  was  re-called  by  the  learned 

Sessions Judge, Islamabad (West) vide order  dated 

06.02.2020. 

3. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submits  that 

the  petitioner 

is 

innocent;  that 

complainant is the petitioner's  former  father-in-law; 

that  the  case  against  the  petitioner  has  been 

registered  on  the  basis  of  personal  grudge  and 

ma/a tides;  that  the petitioner  obtained  Khula from 

the  complainant's  son  on  15.10.2019  whereas 

certificate  for  the effectiveness  of the divorce  was 

issued on 16.01.2020; that the complainant has filed 

several other  cases against  the  petitioner  and her 

relatives; that  the  complainant's  son, Saeed Khan 

Baloch  concealed  the  factum  as  to  his  marriage 

with  the  petitioner  in  the  year  2008,  and  got  it 

registered  in the year 2016; that on account of such 

concealment, the petitioner's  credentials  could not 

2 

Crl.  Misc.  95-B/2020 

be  updated  and  her  passport  was  renewed  with 

previous husband's name. 

4. 

Learned counsel further  submits that  the 

alleged offence does not fall  within  the prohibitory 

clause of section  497 (1) Cr.P.C.; that  case against 

the  petitioner  is based on official  documents lying 

with  the passport  authority;  that  no tampering  with 

such  documents  can  be  apprehended  on  the 

petitioner's  part;  that  the  petitioner  does not have 

any  criminal  record;  and  that  no  recovery 

is 

required  to  be made from  the  petitioner.  Learned 

counsel prayed for  the  petition  to  be allowed and 

the  ad-interim  bail  already  granted  by  this  Court 

vide order dated 10.02.2020 to be confirmed. 

5. 

On the other hand learned counsel for the 

complainant opposed the petition  by submitting that 

marriage  of 

the  petitioner  with  her  previous 

husband Ashfaq Ahmed had ended in the year 2007; 

that  divorce  effectiveness  certificate  was taken in 

the  year  2014; that  the  accused got  renewed her 

passport  on  14.09.2015 showing  her  husband's 

name as Ashfaq Ahmed by  concealing  the factum 

regarding  her  divorce;  and  that  in  presence  of 

sufficient  incriminating  material the petitioner  is not 

entitled  for  grant  of  extraordinary  concession of 

pre-arrest  bail. 

6.  He  further  submitted  that  the  petitioner  had 

been  involved  in  money  laundering;  that 

the 

petitioner  had a bank account  in the U.A.E. in which 

transactions  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  US 

Dollars had taken place; and that the bank account 

details  show that  she had given a wrong  name of 

her  husband. Learned Counsel requested  for  the 

petition to be dismissed. 

7. 

I  have heard the learned counsel for the 

parties  as  well  as  learned  A.A-G.  and  have 

perused the record with their  able assistance. 

8. 

According  to  the  F.l.R., the  allegation 

against  the  petitioner 

is  that  on  14.09.2015 

3 

Crl.  Misc.  95-B/2020 

passport  No.  AE-1842372 was  issued  to  her 

wherein  she  had falsely  used  her  ex-husband's 

name. She is stated to have shown her husband's 

name as Ashfaq Ahmed with  whom her marriage 

had ended in  the year  2007, and on  25.09.2008 

she had already re-married  Saeed Khan Baloch. 

9. 

The  F.l.R.  against  the  petitioner  was 

registered  after  an  inquiry  on  the  complaint  of 

respondent No.2/Shah Muhammad Baloch, who is 

father  of  petitioner's  ex-husband,  Saeed  Khan 

Baloch.  Admittedly  petitioner's  marriage  with 

Saeed  Khan  Baloch  has  also  ended  on 

16.01.2020.  The  record 

reveals  that 

in  his 

complaint  petitioner's  ex-father-in-law  inter  a/ia 

alleged 

that 

the  petitioner  had 

left  her 

matrimonial  abode  along  with  his  property  and 

millions of  US Dollars in  Benami bank accounts. 

The  respondent  No.2  had  admittedly 

lodged 

complaints  against  the  sister  and  brother-in-law 

of the petitioner. 

10. 

The  complaint  of 

respondent  No.2 

prima  facie  appears  to  be  motivated  by  family 

disputes  over  properties  which  have arisen after 

matrimonial  disunion.  Therefore, 

in  such 

circumstances,  apparently,  existence of  ulterior 

motive and ma/a fide cannot be ruled out. 

11. 

The  passport  in  question  has  already 

been  taken  into  custody  by  the  investigating 

agency. The petitioner  is ready to cooperate  with 

the investigation. The offence  alleged against the 

petitioner 

is  at 

the  most  punishable  with 

imprisonment of three  years  or  fine or  with both, 

as such does not fall  in prohibitory  clause of 497 

(1) of  Cr.P.C. Moreover, it  is  to  be  kept  in view 

that accused petitioner  is a lady and is entitled to 

certain  exceptions  under 

first  proviso  Sub 

Section (1) of  Section 497,  Cr.P.C. Sending her 

behind the bars at this stage would not serve any 

useful purpose.  Reference in this  regard  can be 

4 

Crl.  Misc. 95-8/2020 

made to  case of  "Mst.Sonam Naz VS The State" 

(2006MLD1871). 

12. 

In  view  of  the  above,  application  for 

grant  of  pre-arrest  bail is allowed and ad interim 

bail  granted  to  the  petitioner  vide  order  dated 

10.02.2020  stands  confirmed  on  the  basis  of 

bonds already furnishe
