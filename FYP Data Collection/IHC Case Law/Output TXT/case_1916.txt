Petitioner  Imtiaz Ali Khokhar alias Taji
2. 
Khokhar s/o Allah Ditta seeks bail after arrest in case
F.I.R. No.41 dated L9.02.2013  registered  u/ss 302,34,109
P.P.C, with Police  Station Koral, Islamabad  and in private
complaint  filed by complainant  Anees-ul-Afreen  in the said

Crl.Misc No. 184-B/2017  &
L85-B/2077

occurrence, in which,  in addition to above  offences, offence

u/s 201 P.P.C was also included.
3. 
Pithily,  the facts of the case as presented by
the complainant  are that he is owner of a house situated in
Dhoke Gangal East. Some time ogo, Rashid s/o Abdur
Razzaq,  Tanveer  s/o Khan Muhammad Mistri and Imran
s/o Allah Ditta tried to take illegal possession, therefore,
they got injunctive order and also moved application to the
Police Station  Koral.  On the fateful day i.e. 19.02.2013 at
about 12:00  noon he alongwith  his brother  Ishtiaq-ul-
Salkeen  and Shamas-ul-Arfeen was constructing  the
house,  when Imran s/o Allah Ditta, Sajid s/o name not
known and Tanveer  s/o Khan Muhammad  Mistri all armed
with Kalashnikovs  came over there and restrained  them
from raising  construction.  The assailants threatened them,
therefore, they went inside the house due to fear. Then the
assailants came over the roof of adjacent house.  Imran
made burst of Kalashnikov  which hit Khalid Farooq slo
Ishtiaq-ul-  Sallkeen  inside of his left shoulder, who fell on
the ground and succumbed  to the injuries. The trio
decamped from the place of occurrence.  Complainant
further added that the offence  was committed at the
instigation of Imtiaz Ali Khokhar  alias Taji Khokhar/present
petitioner.
4. 
In Crl. Misc No. LB5-Bl20t7 it is disclosed  that
during investigation  of above F.I.R, it proved that the
petitioner  was falsely  involved in this case and there was
no evidence of abetment,  therefore, a private  complaint
was filed. After issua nce of  process, the petitioner
submitted an application under Section 91 Cr. P'C in
private complaint  before the learned  ASJ, Islamabad in
which the petitioner  was directed to submit bail bonds to
the tune of Rs.one lac with one surety. However,  the
complainant challenged the order dated 22.6.2013  before
this court in Crl, Revision,  which was disposed of with the

Crl.Misc No. 184-B/2OL7  &
785-B/20t7

J

observations  that the fate of the case is to be decided  by
the court concerned  i.e trial court on submitting the bail
application. In pursuance whereof, bail applications  of the
petitioner in  both the matters have been dismissed
through consolidated  order dated  t8.3.20t7.
5. 
In support of petitions, learned counsel  for the
petitioner contended  that the petitioner is an old man of 64
years, who is suffering  from multiple diseases. The
petitioner  was under treatment in Jail Hospital, but the
functioning  of kidneys was failed, therefore, hâ‚¬  was
immediately shifted to Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi in
a critical condition where he was admitted on 01.03.20t7.
It is added  that in Holy Family  Hospital due to heart attack
the petitioner  was shifted in a critical condition to the
Rawalpindi  Institute of Cardiology.  Thereafter, he was
shifted back to Holy Family  Hospital,  where the petitioner
is going through the process  of dialysis. The petitioner
requires specialized  treatment for the curement  of diseases.
It  is vigorously contended that the  petitioner is in
incarceration  for the last more than 3Vz years. The
petitioner  was not present at the place  of occurrence and
the only allegation  against the petitioner is of abetment.
There is no detail of witnesses  in the police record.  The
allegation of abetment levelled against the petitioner  is ex
ante. The petitioner  being old, weak and seriously sick and
infirm person  is entitled to the concession of bail. To
supplement  his submissions,  learned counsel relied upon
Fidous Paul v. The State (2004 SCMR 15), Mumtaz Ali
Khan v. The State (2001 P Cr. L J t406 [Lahore]) and
Zar Muhammad  v. Mian Jafar shah and another  (PLD
2009 Supreme Court 707).
6. 
Conversely,  learned  State Counsel assisted  by
learned counsel  for the complainant vehemently  opposed
the bail. It  is contended that the petitioner is habitual
criminal with stinking  reputation,  who is involved in

Crl.Misc No. 184-Bl20L7  &
Lgs-B/2Ot7

number  of criminal cases;  that the offence  was committed
at the behest of the petitioner; that for arrest of the
petitioner, the Hon'ble  Supreme  Court of Pakistan took suo
motu notice and then he was arrested; that the case is at
evidence  stage; that statements of some witnesses have
been recorded; that the required treatment of the
petitioner can be provided at the Hospital of his choice  and
presently the petitioner is being medically  treated  by
highly qualified doctors  and professors;  that the offence
falls within the prohibitory  clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C;
that the deceased was done to death  in a cruel and chilling
manner; that there is  strong evidence  against  the
petitioner;  therefore, he is not entitled to the concession
of bail. To orchestrate  their arguments they have relied
upon Mamaras v.  The State &  others (2009 CrlJ
543);Ghulam  Qammber  Shah v.  Mukhtiar Hussain
and others  (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 66);Malik Javaid
Iqbal v. The State and others (PLD 2015 Supreme  Court
250), Babar  Hussain v. The State and others (2016
SCMR 1538); Naseem Malik v. The State (2004 SCMR
283)i Wazir Gul v.  The State (2016 YLR Note 27
IPeshawar];  Muhammad Imran v.  The State and
others (2016 SCMR 1401); The State v. Haji Kabeer
Khan (PLD 2005 Supreme  Court 364) and Ghulam
Ahmed  Chishti v. The State and another (2013  SCMR
38s).
7. 
submissions  made and perused the record minutely.
Perusal  of  record reveals that statements
8. 
about abetment were recorded  on 25.07.20t3  with a delay
of  almost 5  months and one week. Interestingly,
particulars  of witnesses i.e parentage, caste, age and
addresses examined by the police u/s 161 Cr. P.C have
not been mentioned. Private complaint  was filed on
03.5.2013 but even in that complaint no reference  of

9. 
For further satisfaction vide order dated
31.03.20L7 this court directed  Vice Chancellor, Shaheed
Zulfiqar  Ali Bhutto University to constitute a medical board
and in compliance  with the same a Medial Board was
constituted and report was submitted, which is reproduced
herein below in verbatim:-

"The medical board met on 15.04.2017  and examined  above
patient. Also his previous  record  was reviewed in detail  by the
board members.
He is a long standing  diabetic  with multiple complications
including ischemic  heart  disease with congestive  failure,
retinopathy with visual impairment, nephropathy  leading to end
stage  renal disease  and requiring  renal replacement  therapy in the
form of hemodialoysis  thrice  weekly  and he has evidence  of
peripheral  vasculopathy  with Lt. Big toe already  amputated.
His latest  clinical  status is of marked  debilitation  and he is bed
bound.  There  is fluctuation  in his symptoms  severity as recently he
stayed  in Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology for Acute  coronary
syndrome. He has generalized  changes  of ischaemia  on ECG  and
echocardiography  shows  moderate left ventricular  dysfunction
(EF3s %).
The board is of the opinion  that with all his comorbidities  he
should stay hospitalized  with multi disciplinary  management
approach.  With his clinical  status such a management  is not
possible  in jail hospital.  "

10. 
Above  reports clearly show that the petitioner
is suffering from serious  ailments and complainant  side
could not deny this fact, perhaps this was the reason that
no challenge was put to the reports. The petitioner was
arrested on 05.08.2013  when he was brought from Dubai
in compliance  with order of apex court. The role ascribed
to the petitioner,  evidence available  on record and the
allegation of abetment, prima  facie are not of much value
and significance as persons examined  by the police with
the names  of Muhammad Rizwan and Abdul Qadir have no
identity on record. The Inspector/I.O  of the case in so
many  words  admitted in the court that both the persons
were brought by the complainant,  but he did not bother  to
take details about the persons produced and incorporated
in statements  u/s 161 Cr, P.C. I have no doubt that this
approach of the I.O/Inspector is not only dishonest but
speaks  volume of incompetence and lack of understanding
about the requirement  of law, The way he proceeded  in
the matter, I  am fully satisfied that this official is not
competent  to handle  investigation of even a minor  case

Crl.Misc No. 184-B/2OL7  &.

what to talk of case involving  capital punishment. Copy of
this order  be communicated to the IG , ICT, Islamabad  for
holding an inquiry and if found guilty to take action against
him in accordance  with law.
11. 
From the available  evidence  and allegations, I
am convinced  that the petitioner  has made out a case of
further inquiry under Section 497 (2) Cr.P.C.  The petitioner
admittedly suffering  from serious illneis which requires
treatment of  choice, special  diet and conducive
atmosphere.  Reliance in this regard is placed on L997 P Crl
L J 348. Moreover,  allegations  of abetment cannot be
found sufficient to deprive  any accused of his fundamental
right guaranteed  by Article 9 of the Constitution  of the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan,  t973.
L2. 
Although, trial has commenced  and normally
courts do not interfere to grant or refuse  bail at this stage
of proceedings. But this rule is not absolute  and when any
accused successfully makes  out his case of further  inquiry,
bail is granted. Guidance  on this is sought from PLD 1989
Supreme  Court 585, 1997 P Cr L J 847, PLD 1989 Lahore
233 and 1991 SCMR  322, on point of absence. As far
judgments relied upon by learned  counsel for  the
complainant  are concerned,  the same  are not applicable  to

the facts and circumstances  of this case.
13. 
The net result that flows from the above
discussion  is that the petitioner is entitled to concession of
bail in both the matters.  Consequently,  both the petitions
are allowed and the petitioner is admitted to bail, subject
to furnishing  bail bonds in the sum of Rs.25-lacs  with two
sureties  each in the like amount to the satisfaction  of the
learned  trial Court.
14. 
The learned  trial court is directed to conclude
the trial within a period  of three months without granting
un-necessary  adjournments and submit compliance  report
till 29th July, 20t7.

The name of the petitioner  shall be placed on

However, the petitioner will be at liberty for his treatment
at the hospital of his choice within the country.
