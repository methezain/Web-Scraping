Complainant  of the  case  opted  not  to  appear  despite  proper  service of 

notice on him. 

4. 

The case  of the  prosecution  against  the  Petitioner  is  that  the  petitioner 

who  is  Patwari  in  Moza Kotli Sattiyan,  Rawalpindi, has  issued  cheque  No. 

172922513  dated  05.08.2019,  amounting  to  Rs. 4,000,000/-  drawn  on  MCB 

Bank,  Jinnah  Road, Rawalpindi,  to  the  complainant  on  account  of return  of 

loan,  however, sought  three  months  time before enchasing  the  same.  But,  said 

cheque  was  dishonored  when  presented  in his  account  maintained  with  Soneri 

Bank  Limited Lehtrar  Road, Tarlai,  Islamabad,  due  to insufficient  balance.  The 

complainant  alleged issuance  of cheque  with dishonest  intention  and  registered 

FIR against  the petitioner. 

2 

CrLMisc.No.923-B/2020 

:l  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  FIR has  been 

registered  on  12.12.2019,  for alleged  commission  of offence on  26.09.2019, 

with delay of 76  days  which  has  remained  unexplained;  that  the  petitioner  has 

no  business  or  family relations  with  the  complainant,  therefore,  there  is  no 

question  of obtaining  or  returning  of loan  to  him;  that  in  fact  the  cheque  has 

been  issued  as  a  guarantee  cheque  on  behalf  of a  friend  in  respect  of some 

property  transaction  to  Raja  Nouman  who is  a  property  dealer;  that  the  said 

Raja  Nouman  has  also  registered  FIR  No.  77 /2019,  dated  22.02.2019, 

regarding  similar  offence  and  the  bail  application  is  pending  before  the 

appropriate  Court;  that  FIR Nos. 07 /2017  &  17 /2019  dated  29.03.2017  and 

12 .10. 2019,  respectively,  have  also  been  registered  against  the  petitioner  in 

terms  of sections  471,  420,  468  &  409  PPC and  5/2/47  PCA trial  whereof is 

pending  before the  Anti-Corruption  Court  Rawalpindi,  in  which  he  has  been 

granted  bail,  vide order  dated  13.08.2020  and  17.08.2020,  respectively,  by 

learned  District  &  Sessions  Judge/Special 

Judge,  Anti-Corruption  Court, 

Rawalpindi; that  the  petitioner  has  been  arrested  on  09.07.2020;  that  the 

investigation  has  been  completed  and,  therefore,  there  is also  no  possibility of 

tempering with  the  record;  that  there  is  no  previous  conviction and  there  is no 

question  of abscondence  of  the  petitioner;  that  the  case  also  does  not  fall 

within  the  prohibitory  clause  of section  497  Cr.PC. Learned  counsel  prayed  for 

grant  of bail  to  the  petitioner  by  placing  reliance  on  case  titled  Muhammad 

Shabbir v.  The State and another (2020  YLR N 22 HC Lahore). 

6.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  State  Counsel  present  with  the  1.0.  has 

vehemently  opposed  the  petition  for  grant  of  bail  to  the  petitioner  and 

submitted  that 

transaction  of  Rs.  4,000,000/- 

is  involved for  which  the 

petitioner  has  issued  a  cheque  with  dishonest  intention  as  the  cheque  of the 

same  amount  has  also been  issued  by the  same  petitioner  which  has  also been 

dishonored;  that  petitioner  is  a  government  employee against  whom  other 

FIRs/cases  in  terms  of section  409,  420,  468,  471 PPC read  with  5/2/47  PCA 

are  pending  in  the  Anti-Corruption  Court;  that  though  the  petitioner  has  not 

been  convicted  so  far,  however, is  a  habitual  offender  in  view of the  FIRs 

registered  against  him;  that 

the  petitioner,  therefore,  is  not  entitled  for 

concession  of bail.

Crl.Miac.No.923-B/2020 

7.  Arguments  heard.  Record perused. 

8. 

Record  reveals  that 

the  petitioner/accused 

has  been  arrested  on 

09.07.2020,  in  the  present  case.  In the  present  case  it has  been  observed from 

the  perusal  of the  FIR that  the  petitioner  has  obtained  loan  of Rs. 4,000,000 /  

from the  complainant  on  20.07.2019,  and  issued  cheque  No. 172922513  dated 

05.08.2019,  to  be encashed  after  three  months  if the  loan  is  not  returned  by 

the  petitioner.  As per  contents  of the  FIR the  cheque  has  been  presented  in the 

Bank  on 26.09.2019,  after  three  months  as  committed  by the  petitioner  which 

was  dishonored  due  to insufficient  amount  in  the  relevant  account.  It  has  also 

been  noted  that  the  complainant  has  registered  the  FIR after  the  delay of 76 

days for which no explanation  has  been incorporated  in the  FIR. Record further 

shows that  the  petitioner  has  been  granted  bail by the  learned  Special Judge 

Anti-Corruption  Court,  Rawalpindi,  in  FIR  Nos.  07 /2017  and  17 /2019, 

therefore,  as  such,  the  petitioner  till date  has  not  been  convicted  in  any  case. 

Moreover, it  is  now  well  settled  through  different  pronouncements  of  the 

superior  courts  of the  country  that  mere  registration  of other  criminal  cases 

against  accused,  without  conviction,  does  not  disentitle  him  from  the 

concession  of bail. Reliance in  this  regard  is  placed  on  the  cases  reported  as 

Muhammad  Roshan  VS  The  State  (2016  MLD  392}  and  Muhammad 

Sarwar  VS The  State  and  others  (2016  YLR Note  110). The investigation 

appears  to have  been  completed,  as  such,  petitioner  is not  required  for further 

investigation.  Moreover, the  case  falls  under  the  non-prohibitory  clause  of 

section 497 Cr.PC. The Honorable Supreme  Court  of Pakistan  through  different 

authoritative  pronouncements, 

in  this  regard  has  time  and  again  held,  that 

when  an  offence does  not  fall within  the  prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497 

Cr.P.C, bail is a rule  and  refusal  an  exception. It has  been  held by this  Court in 

the  judgment  re:  Muhammad  Irfan  VS The  State  (2015  PCr.LJ  129), that 

"section 489-F of PPC is not a provision  which  is intended  by the  legislature to be 

used  for recovery of an  alleged  amount.  It  is  only  to determine  guilt of criminal 

act and  award  a sentence,  fine or both". Hon'ble Lahore High Court  in  a  recent 

judgment  titled  as  Muhammad  Shabbir  v.  The  State  and  another  (2020 

YLR N  22  HC Lahore}, relied upon  by the  learned  counsel  for the  petitioner 

has  observed as  under: 

4 

CrLMisc.No.923-B/2020 

"It  may further  be  noted  that  the  case  against  the present  petitioner  is 
almost  entirely  reliant  on  documentary  evidence  which,  admittedly,  is 
in  the possession  of the prosecution  and  clearly  there  is  no possibility 
of  the petitioner  tampering  with  the  same.  The  cheque  in  question  is 
already  in  the  custody  of the  court  which  is  dealing  with  the  suit filed 
by  the  respondent  No.2  under  Order  XXXVII,  Rule  11  of  C.P.C. 
Keeping  the petitioner  incarcerated  would  tantamount  to punishing  him 
despite  the fact  that  a person  is presumed  to  be  innocent  until proven 
guilty.  The  Courts  have  invariably  learned favourably 
in  the  granting 
of bail  when  the  case  is dependent  upon  documentary  evidence  and  the 
same  is in possession  of the prosecuting  agency.  Reliance  in this regard 
is  placed  on  "Saeed  Ahmed  v.  The  State"  (1996  SCMR  1132)  and 
"Muhammad  Nawaz  v. The  State  through  Chairman,  NAB,  Islamabad 
and  another"  (PLD  2008  SC  438).  It  has  been  observed  by  the 
augustSupreme  Court  of Pakistan  in the case  of "Manzoor and  4  others 
v.  The State"  (PLD  1972 SC 81) as infra; 

"The  ultimate  conviction  and  incarceration  of  a  guilty  person  can 
repair  the  wrong  caused  by a mistaken  relief of interim  bail granted  to 
him,  but  no  satisfactory  reparation  can  be  offered  to  an  innocent  man 
for  his  unjustified  incarceration  at  any  stage  of  the  case  albeit  his 
acquittal  in the long run. " 

In  the  light  of the facts  and  circumstances  of the present  case, 

the refusal  of bail will tantamount  to punishing  the petitioner.  ". 

9. 

For what  has  been  discussed  above, this  petition  is accepted  by placing 

reliance  on  the  case  law referred  above as  well as  on  principles  laid down by 

the  Hon 'ble Supreme  Court  of Pakistan  in  the  case  of  Tariq  Bashir  and  5 

others  v.  The  State  (PLD 1995  SC 34}, and  Petitioner  is  admitted  to  post 

arrest  bail, subject  to his  furnishing  bail bonds  in  the  sum  of Rs. 5,00,000/  

(Rupees Five Lac) with  one  surety  in  the  like amount  to  the  satisfaction  of 

learned Trial Court. 

10.  All the  observations  made  hereinabove  are  tentative  in  nature  and  shall 

have no  bearing  on  the  final determination  of guilt  or  innocence  by the  trial 

Court.
