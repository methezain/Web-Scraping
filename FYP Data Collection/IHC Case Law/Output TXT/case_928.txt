Raja  Nisar  Ul  Haq,  Mr.  Tahir  Afzal  Abbasi 
and Mr. Shahzad Kiyani, Advocates for the 
respondents. 

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  order 

dated  22.03.2021,  whereby 

the 

learned 

Guardian  Judge  has  fixed  interim maintenance 

to be paid by the  petitioner  as Rs.25000/- per 

month  excluding  monthly  school 

fee  and 

medical  treatment  expenses    for  each  of  the 

children.  

2. 

Learned counsel for the  petitioner  stated 

that 

total 

interim  maintenance  allowance 

comes  out  to  be  approximately  Rs.380,000/-, 

which  is  prohibitive.  He  further  submitted  that 

the  petitioner  is  presently  un-employed  as  he 

was  laid  off  from  his  job  in  Saudi  Arabia  on 

20.09.2020.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents 

submitted that the petitioner was earning over 

one million Rupees from his job as an engineer 

in  Saudi  Arabia.  Even  in  the  event  he  is  not 

working  as  an  engineer  in  Saudi  Arabia  any 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
more,  he  is  a  person  of  means  and  possesses 

real  estate  of  substantial  value.  He  submitted 

that the property worth of Rs. 90 lacs was sold 

by  the  petitioner  seven  days  before  the 

passing  of  the  impugned  order  and  it  was 

reflected in the transaction document that after 

application  of  Deputy  Commissioner  (DC)  rate 

the transaction was valued Rs. 40 lacs. He also 

placed  additional  documents  on 

record 

regarding  other  real  estate  property  owned  by 

the  petitioner.  He  further  submitted  that  the 

maintenance that has been granted is in lieu of 

school 

fee 

that  has  been 

incurred  by 

respondent No.2, as respondents No.3 to 7 are 

attending  schools  such  as  Beaconhouse, 

SuperNova  and  Headstart.  He  contends  that 

there  is  no  infirmity  in  the  impugned  order 

passed by the learned Guardian Court.  

4. 

In  rebuttal,  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  stated  that  the  suit  was  filed  in 

October 2020 and under the Family Courts Act, 

1964 the suit was to be decided within a period 

of  six  months.  And  that  the  learned  Family 

Court be directed to decide the matter within a 

month  while  keeping  the  ad-interim  injunction 

granted by this Court in field.  

5. 

This  Court  has  perused  the  impugned 

order as well as the record produced before the 

 
 
 
Court.  The  impugned  order  was  passed  on 

22.03.2021,  pursuant  to  which  the  Court 

directed  that  Rs.25000/-per  month  for  each 

child  be  paid  by  the  petitioner  as  interim 

maintenance.  It  is  an  admitted  fact  that 

respondents  No.3  to  7  are  school  going 

children  and  are  enrolled  in  schools  and 

consequently  fee  for  their  education  has  to  be 

paid.  It  is  also  admitted  that  the  petitioner  is 

the father of the respondents No.3 to 7 and is 

under  a  legal  obligation  to  maintain  them  and 

has  not  paid  any  expenses  for  them  from 

22.03.2021  till  30.06.2021,  when  the  learned 

Guardian  Court  ordered  to  petitioner  to  clear 

all  outstanding  maintenance  amount  as  fixed 

by it.  

6. 

In  view  of  the  above  facts,  there  is  no 

infirmity  in  the  impugned  order  and  the 

maintenance  amount  fixed  on  interim  basis. 

Consequently, the petition is dismissed with a 

cost  of  Rs.  10,000/-  payable  by  the  petitioner 

to  respondent  No.2  within  a  period  of  seven 

days. The learned Guardian Court is directed to 

decide  the  matter  within  period  of  thirty  (30) 

days.
