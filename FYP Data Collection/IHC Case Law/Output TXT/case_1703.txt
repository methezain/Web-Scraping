Proceedings 

13.02.2020  Mr. Imran  Feroze,  Advocate  for  petitioner. 
Respondent  No.1  in person. 

Through 

the 

instant 

petition, 

the 

petitioner  seeks  direction 

to  respondent  No.2 

for  re-examination  of  the  parties 

for  DNA 

test. 

2. 

The 

facts,  m  brief, 

are 

that 

the 

petitioner  and  respondent  No. I  are  involved  in 

litigation 

in  Family  Court.  The  assertion  of 

respondent  No.1  is  that  she 

is  the  wife  of 

petitioner  hence  dower  be  awarded, 

along 

with  maintenance  as  well  as  transfer  of  house 

be  made.  In  this  behalf,  civil  litigation  between 

the  parties 

is  also  pending.  In  the  course  of 

events, 

the  matter  was  referred  to  Forensic 

Agency  for  evaluation,  as  it  was  alleged  by 

respondent  No.1 

that  DNA 

test  of 

the 

petitioner  was 

found  on  her  body.  The 

petitioner  now  seeks  re-evaluation. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter 

elis,  contended 

that  report 

is  not  correct 

hence  cannot  be  believed  and  the  matter  be 

re-evaluated. 

4. 

Respondent  No.1, 

in  person, 

submits 

that 

instant  petition 

is  another 

in-series 

to 

exploit  her  and  linger  on the  proceedings.

5. 

Arguments 

advanced 

by 

the  parties 

have  been  heard  and  the  documents,  placed  on 

record,  examined  with  their  able  assistance. 

6. 

The  petitioner  seeks  re-examination  of 

DNA analysis. 

7. 

It seems  that  the  matter  is  still  pending 

investigation.  It  is  trite  law  that  courts  do  not 

interfere 

in  the  investigation,  as  it  is  the  sole 

prerogative  of the  investigating  agency. 

8. 

In  view  of  above, 

instant  petition 

is 

disposed 

of  with 

the 

observation 

that 

petitioner  may  make  a  request,  as  made  in the 

instant  petition, 

to  the  investigating  agency, 

which  if  it  deems  appropriate,  would  do  the 

needful  in accordance  with  law.
