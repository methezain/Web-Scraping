Proceedings 

07.09.2021  Hafiz Farman Ullah, Advocate for petitioner.  

Ch.  Adnan  Qamar,  Advocate  for  respondents 
No.1 to 5. 

The  petitioner  and  respondent  No.1  were 

married  and  out  of  the  wedlock,  four  children 

namely  respondents  No.2  to  5,  were  born.  The 

petitioner  was  based  overseas  and  upon  his 

return,  learnt  that  respondent  No.1  has  filed  a 

suit for dissolution of marriage. The said suit was 

decreed,  however, 

the  petitioner 

filed  an 

application  before  the  Guardian  Judge  seeking 

custody of the minor children and in this behalf, 

custody  of  two    minors  (respondent  No.2)  and 

(respondent  No.4)  was  granted  by  respondent 

No.7 vide judgment dated 25.01.2018; appeal was 

preferred  by  respondent  No.1  against  the  said 

judgment  and  decree  which  was  allowed  vide 

judgment  dated  25.09.2018  and  custody  of  the 

referred  children  was  granted  to  respondent 

No.1,  hence the petition.  

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia 

contended that custody of respondent Nos.2 to 5 

ought  to  have  been  granted  to  the  petitioner  as 

being  the  natural  guardian  he  is  entitled  to  the 

same.  When  confronted  as  to  the  legal  infirmity 

or jurisdictional error in the impugned judgment,

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was  unable  to 

point out any. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent  Nos.1  to 

5  submitted  that  maintenance  was  awarded  to 

respondents  but  petitioner  has  not  paid  a  single 

penny.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was 

confronted  in  this  regard  and  he  expressed  that 

he is not in contact with his client.   

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  learned  counsel 

for 

the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

the 

documents,  placed  on  record,  examined  with 

their able assistance.  

5. 

The  facts,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petition,  have  been  mentioned  hereinabove 

therefore need not be reproduced. 

6. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was 

unable  to  point  out  any  legal  infirmity  in  the 

impugned judgment. The learned appellate court, 

while  allowing  appeal  of  respondent  No.1,  has 

cogently  spelt  out  the  reasons  for  handing  back 

custody of respondent Nos.2 to 4 to respondent 

No.1;  no  exception can  be  taken  to  the  referred  

reasons  and  reliance  placed  on  the  judgment 

reported  as  in  case  ‘Mst.  Nazli  VS  Muhammad 

Ilyas’ (2010 MLD 477). 

7. 

Since  the  impugned  judgment  does  not 

suffer  from  any  legal  or  jurisdictional  error, 

instant petition is without merit. 

8. 

For  the  above  reasons,  instant  petition  is 

dismissed.
