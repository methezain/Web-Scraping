JUDGMENT 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:-  By  way  of  this  single  judgment, 

I  intend  to  decide  the  above  mentioned  writ  petitions  having  similar 

questions of law and facts.  

2. 

In W.P. No.3049/2019, Pak Qatar Family Takaful Ltd. (petitioner) is 

aggrieved  with  the  order,  dated  09.08.2019,  passed  by  President’s 

Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad,  whereby  representation  filed  by  the 

petitioner  against  the  order  of  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman,  dated 

21.12.2018, has been rejected. Shaoib Ahmad (Respondent No.2) had filed a 

complaint before the Federal Insurance Ombudsman against the petitioner

Company stating that agent of petitioner Company visited him in the year 

2017 and convinced  him to make investment in  the company, whereupon 

he had issued a cheque of Rs.3,000,000/- for the purpose of investment. A 

policy  was  issued  against  an  amount  of  Rs.1,000,000/-  while  outstanding 

amount  of  Rs.2,000,000/-  was  deposited  as  top-up.  The  petitioner 

Company  has  also  received  administrative  charges  of  Rs.13,000/-.  The 

agent of the petitioner company also convinced Respondent No.2 to ask his 

brother  Yasir  Islam  (Respondent  No.3)  to  make  investment  towards  the 

saving  plans,  whereby  assurance  of  profit  to  the  tune  of  Rs.17,000/-  per 

months  was  given,  per  se,  Yasir  Islam  /  Respondent  No.3  had  also 

invested  an  amount  of  Rs.1,000,000/-.  When  Respondent  No.2  contacted 

the  petitioner  company  for  his  monthly  profit,  he  was  informed  that  his 

deposited  amount  has  now  been  reduced  to  Rs.2,300,000/-  due  to  fall  in 

stock  market.  Accordingly,  the  said  respondents  approached  the  Federal 

Insurance  Ombudsman,  whereby  the  petitioner  company  was  directed  to 

pay the full deposited amount, as such, the said order has been maintained 

by the President’s Secretariat (Public), Islamabad.  

3. 

Similarly,  in  W.P.  No.3050/2019,  Hamid  Saeed  (respondent  No.2) 

has  filed  a  complaint  to  the  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman  that  he 

purchased  Educational  Takaful  Plan  from  the  petitioner  company  in  the 

year 2010 for 10 years on annual contribution  of Rs.20,110/- and when he 

approached  the  petitioner  company  in  the  year  2013  to  surrender  the 

policy, he was directed to wait as the cash value of the policy at that time 

was about 50%. He again approached the petitioner Company in the year 

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 3 

2015  and  he  was  paid  an  amount  of  Rs.117,302/-  against  the  total 

deposited  amount  of  Rs.140,416/-  i.e.  short  of  Rs.22,698/-.  The  complaint 

was allowed by the Federal Insurance Ombudsman and the order has been 

maintained  by  the  President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad  through  the 

impugned order dated 22.07.2019. Hence, the captioned writ petitions. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  respective  petitioners  contended  that  in  both 

these writ petitions the Federal Insurance Ombudsman has not attended to 

the  matter  in  accordance  with  law  and,  as  such,  the  Federal  Insurance 

Ombudsman  has  no  jurisdiction  to  adjudicate  upon  the  matter  involving 

factual questions, per se, it is the mandate of Insurance Tribunal to give a 

ruling on  all  matters  involving  factual  questions,  which  are  related  to  the 

amount  of  investment,  time  frame,  nature  of  profit  and  loss  but,  all  these 

questions  have  been  overlooked  by  the  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman; 

that  the  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman  as  well  as  the  President’s 

Secretariat (Public), Islamabad have not taken into account the reasons for 

withdrawal  of  investment,  which  in-fact  discloses  factual  dispute;  that 

Section 129 of Insurance Ordinance, 2000 lays down procedure for making 

complaint to Federal Insurance Ombudsman, which requires that any such 

complaint  has  to  be  made  on  solemn  affirmation  or  oath  in  writing  and 

prior  to  making  complaint  the  complainant  is  obliged  to  give  notice  of 

intention  to  the  insurance  company  but,  all  these  aspects  have  been 

ignored;  that  a  table  has  been  provided  by  the  petitioner  company  to  the 

private  respondents  for  the  first  year  till  maturity  of  investment  towards 

the  allocated  units  for  investment  and  the  ratio  provided  in  the  column 

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 4 

clearly spells out that 23% of the  amount would be deducted in first year 

and  in  second  year  80%  would  be  invested  from  remaining  amount, 

whereas 20% overhead administrative expenses should be deducted by the 

petitioner company under their policy but, all these aspects have not been 

considered by the forums below.  

5. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.2  &  3  in  W.P. 

No.3049/2019 contended that the said respondents have been deprived of 

their hard earned money of Rs.4.0 Million and not a single penny has been 

paid  as  profit,  however  during  the  course  of  arguments  the  petitioner 

company  expressed  their  intention  for  release  of  their  payment  to  the 

extent of Rs.2,457,954.96 and Rs.740,206.68, respectively, to the respondents 

excluding  the  amount  of  approximately  Rs.800,000/-  on  account  of 

expenditures  and  other  allied  charges,  per  se,  on  direction  of  this  Court 

passed  vide  order  dated  12.02.2021,  pay  orders  to  the  extent  of  admitted 

amount  by  the  petitioner  company  have  been  issued  in  favour  of 

respondents No.2  &  3, whereas rest of  the claim of Rs.800,000/- has to be 

decided in this case.  

6. 

Similarly,  in  W.P.  No.3050/2019,  learned  counsel  for  respondent 

No.2 contended that the petitioner company has secured  maximum profit 

by themselves against the interest of policy holders, which amounts to the 

principle of unjust enrichment at the cost of investors; that the amount so 

deducted by  the petitioner Company is not permissible  as the investment 

policy has been regulated by the petitioner Company through their experts 

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 5 

and  any  of  their  lapse  in  the  investment  concept  has  to  be  contributed  to 

petitioner only, as such, the customer should not be suffered.  

7. 

8. 

Arguments heard, record perused.  

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  the  Pak  Qatar  Family  Takaful  Ltd. 

(petitioner)  is  mainly  aggrieved  with  the  concurrent  orders  of  Federal 

Insurance  Ombudsman  and  President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad, 

passed  on  the  complaint  filed  by  the  private  respondents,  who  had 

invested  their  amount  with  the  petitioner  company  through  different 

policies  on  the  assurance  given  by  the  petitioner  Company  that 

respondents will get reasonable profit, as such, the petitioner company has 

allegedly displayed a rosy picture to the respondents qua their investment 

and margins of profits but, the petitioner company has initially deducted a 

huge sum of money under the head of administrative cost.  

9. 

In  W.P.  No.3049/2019,  respondents  No.2  &  3  had  invested  an 

amount  of  Rs.4.0  million  with  the  petitioner  Company  against  the 

assurance  of  getting  Rs.7,000/-  profit  per  month  but,  same  was  not  paid 

and when said respondents have approached the petitioner company, they 

have been informed that their invested amount has been shrunken because 

of  fall  in  unit  price,  which  was  on  lower  side  due  to  stock  market  with 

passage  of  time.  All  these  reasons  are  related  to  technical  aspect  of  the 

matter,  which  were  in  the  hands  of  petitioner  company  to  regulate  in  the 

best  interest  of  the  customer.  The  said  respondents  when  contacted  the 

petitioner  company  and  requested  to  return  the  amount  of  the  savings 

plan, the petitioner Company informed them the amount of Rs.3,200,000/- 

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 6 

is  the  current  cash  value  of  the  total  deposited  amount  of  Rs.4.0  Million, 

which  was  not  acceptable  to  said  respondents,  as  a  result  whereof,  they 

approached  the  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman,  who  directed  the 

petitioner company to pay the full deposited amount of Rs.4.0 Million vide 

order  dated  21.12.2018.  The  petitioner  company  feeling  aggrieved  thereof 

filed  representation  to  the  President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad, 

whereby the order of Federal Insurance Ombudsman has been maintained.  

10. 

I have gone through the orders of the President’s Secretariat (Public), 

Islamabad,  whereby  it  has  been  observed  that  a  news  item  published  in 

Daily  Jang,  dated  24.04.2018,  was  given  valuable  consideration  by  the 

President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad  during  the  course  of  hearing, 

which  reveals  that  the  petitioner  company  had  earned  profit  of  Rs.133 

Billion in the year 2017. Similarly, shareholder company of Takaful Group 

“Takaful Fund” also posted record net surplus of Rs.116 Million in the year 

2017.  On  the  basis  of  such  public  information,  the  ground  raised  by  the 

petitioner Company that cash value of policy at the time of surrender was 

lower  than  the  investment  due  to  dip  in  stock  market  is  not  appreciated 

and is considered to be contrary to record.  All these aspects demonstrates 

that  the  petitioner  company  was  given  due  right  of  hearing  qua  their 

stance and the role played by the Federal Insurance Ombudsman is within 

its  power  to  regulate  the  affairs  of  maladministration  by  the  insurance 

company  and  even  the  President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad  under 

the Federal Ombudsmen Institutional Reforms Act, 2013 has complied with 

minimum standards envisaged in the law.  

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 7 

11. 

In  W.P.  No.3050/2019,  Respondent  No.2  has  been  deprived  of 

amount  of  Rs.22,698/-  without  any  justiciable  reason  at  the  time  of 

withdrawal on similar ground referred in earlier case.  

12. 

The learned counsel for respondents has  mainly argued the case on 

the  point  of  unjust  enrichment,  whereby  the  petitioner  company  has 

retained  the  benefit  of  a  person  through  an  inequitable  manner,  which 

creates economic exploitation, especially when the petitioner company has 

failed to explain their standards of deduction of any amount  through any 

principle of equity or fairness. The concept of unjust enrichment has duly 

been explained by the Hon’ble Lahore High Court in case reported as 2014 

PTD  1939  Lahore  (SNGPL  v.  Deputy  Commissioner  Inland  Revenue)  as 

well  as  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  UK  in  case  reported  as  2017  SCMR  907 

(Lowick Rose LLP v. Swynson Ltd.), whereby it was held that any benefit 

claimed by the company at the expense of claimant by transferring the loss 

to the claimant on his own amount is violation of the rights of the claimant. 

This  Court  is  of  the  view  that  petitioner  Company  has  indirectly  applied 

the principle of unjust enrichment in this case.  

13. 

This Court is also mindful of the fact that constitutional jurisdiction 

under Article 199 is not designed for regular appeal or to be  equated with 

regular  appeal,  hence  this  Court  cannot  interfere  in  the  findings  of  fact 

merely on the ground that reasons, which found favour with the authority 

whose  order  is  under  scrutiny,  were  not  such  which  would  have  been 

accepted by the High Court. The constitutional jurisdiction can be invoked 

to  rectify  jurisdictional  defect  or  it  would  be  press  into  serve  against  the 

 
W.P. No.3049/2019 & W.P. No.3050/2019  

        Page 8 

order  which  is  without  jurisdiction  or  tainted  with  malice  or  violation  of 

constitution  /  law  and  not  to  correct  the  findings  of  the  fact  or  even  can 

interference with the findings of fact where it was observed that there is no 

evidence  or  is  contrary  to  the  evidence.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  1994 

SCMR  859  (Export  Promotion  Bureau  v.  Qaiser  Shafiullah),  2018  PLC 

Note 29 Karachi (Independent Media Corporation (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Raja Tariq 

Mehmood),  PLD  2018  Islamabad  300  (Dr.  Farooq  Sattar  v.  Election 

Commission  of  Pakistan),  2015  MLD  1760  Azad  Kashmir  (Muhammad 

Iqbal v. Custodian Evacuee Property (AJ&K), 2003 MLD 772 Lahore (Siraj 

Din  v.  Member  (Judicial-I)  Board  of  Revenue,  Lahore),  2006  YLR  697 

Lahore  (Malik  Saeed  Ahmad  v.  Additional  District  Judge)  and  2015  PLC 

(CS)  225  Lahore  (Mrs.  Zaib-un-Nisa  v.  Secretary  Health,  Government  of 

Punjab, Lahore). 

14. 

In  view  of  above  principles  appreciated  in  different  case  laws,  the 

fact finding arrived at by the forums below could not be interfered with in 

constitutional  jurisdiction  as  there  is  no  apparent  illegality  in  the  orders. 

The  petitioner  company  has  been  given  fair  chance  to  take  all  kinds  of 

defence  before  the  Federal  Insurance  Ombudsman  as  well  as  before  the 

President’s  Secretariat  (Public),  Islamabad,  per  se,  it  is  not  the  case  of 

petitioner  company  that  it  has  been  condemned  unheard  in  any  manner, 

although  certain  expenses  /  expenditures  have  not  been  considered  in  a 

proper manner but, this Court cannot interfere being in judicial review qua 

the factual aspects, especially when there is no jurisdictional error apparent 

on record.

15. 

It  is  pertinent  to  mention  that  in  W.P.  No.3049/2019,  the  petitioner 

Company has issued Pay Order No.07768559, dated 16.02.2021, amounting 

to Rs.740,224/- in favour of Yasir Islam and Pay Order No.07768648, dated 

19.02.2021, amounting to Rs.2,457,955/- in favour of Shoaib Ahmad, which 

were  handed  over  to  said  respondents,  however  the  remaining  amount 

which has been settled by the forums below has been maintained.  

16. 

In view  of above position, both the captioned writ petitions  are not 

maintainable and same are hereby DISMISSED.
