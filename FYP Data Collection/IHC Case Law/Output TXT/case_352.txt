SAMAN  RAFAT  IMTIAZ,  J.:-      Through  the  instant  writ  petition  under  Article 

199  of  the  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the  Petitioner 

[Pervez]  has  assailed  the  concurrent  Judgments  &  Decrees  dated  28.02.2019  and 

14.11.2019  (“Impugned  Judgments  &  Decrees”)  passed  by  the  learned  Judge, 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad  (“Family  Court”)  and  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge (West) Islamabad (“Appellate Court”), respectively.  

2. 

The  facts  in  brief  as  per  the Memo of Petition are that the Respondent No.1 

[Huma  Israr]  and  Respondent  No.2  [Umama  Mariam]  filed  a  Suit  for Recovery of 

Dower  in  the  shape  of  2 tola Gold Ornaments, Maintenance Allowances at the rate 

of  Rs.30,000/-  per  head  per  month  and  Dowry  Articles/Gold  Ornaments.  The 

Petitioner  contested  the  suit  by  filing  written  statement.  Thereafter  issues  were 

framed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  and  after  recording  of  evidence,  the  learned 

Family  Court  decreed  the  suit  of  the  Respondents  No.1  &  2  on  28-02-2019  as 

follows:- 

“(i)  That  the  plaintiff  No.1  is  entitled  for  her  maintenance 
w.e.f.  01-01-2012  to  25-08-2013  at  the  rate  of  Rs.3000/-  per 
month. 
(ii)  The  Plaintiff  No.2/minor  is  entitled  for  her maintenance 
at the rat of Rs.5,000/- per month w.e.f. the date of her birth till 
her marriage with increase of 15% annually. 
(iii)  The  Plaintiff  No.1  is  entitled  to  take  back  possession  of 
dowry articles as per receipts Ex.P/3 to Ex.P/10 or in alternate 
lump sum amount of Rs.1,00,000/- 
(iv)  To  the  extent  of  rest  of  the  claim  of  plaintiff,  the  suit 
stands dismissed.” 

3. 

Feeling  aggrieved  of  the  Impugned  Judgment  and  Decree  dated  28-02-2019, 

the  Petitioner  filed  an  appeal  before  the  learned  Appellate  Court.    The  learned 

Appellate  Court  modified  the Impugned Judgment and Decree dated 28-02-2019 of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the Family Court vide Impugned Judgment & Decree dated 14-11-2019 which is re-

produced as under:-  

“it is ordered that the instant appeal is accepted only to the extent that 
the annual increase in the maintenance of the respondent/plaintiff well 
be @, 10% instead of 15% and alternate lump sum amount of decreed 
dowry  articles  is  reduced  to  Rs.75,000/-  from  Rs.1,00,000/-.  The 
impugned judgment and decree are modified accordingly.” 
Being  aggrieved  and  dissatisfied  by  the  Impugned  Judgments  &  Decrees 

4. 

dated  14-11-2019  and  28-02-2019  passed  by  the  learned  Appellate  Court  and  the 

learned  Family  Court  the  Petitioner has preferred the instant writ petition for setting 

aside the same. 

5. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  appeal  was  filed  in 

respect  of  Issues  No.1,  2,  and  5  as  framed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  which 

pertain  to  the  maintenance  allowance  of  Respondents  No.1  &  2  and  recovery  of 

dowry  articles,  gold  ornaments  or  price  thereof  at  the  prevailing  market  rate.  In 

respect of maintenance, she submitted that the Respondent No.1 admittedly did not 

have  any  proof  with  regard  to her allegation that the Petitioner’s monthly income is 

Rs.30,000/- despite which both the lower courts have granted the Respondents No.1 

&  2  maintenance  allowance  at  an  excessive  rate  which  is  beyond  the means of the 

Petitioner.  With  regard  to  the  dowry  articles  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner 

drew  the  attention  of  this  Court  to  the  affidavit-in-evidence  submitted  by  the 

witnesses  produced  by  the  Petitioner  who  stated  that  the  dowry  articles  were 

returned  to  the  Respondent  No.1  and  accepted  by  her  father  on  her behalf in their 

presence. She argued that the learned Family Court erred in concluding that the said 

witnesses i.e., DW-2 & 3 failed to recognize their signatures on the list produced as 

Ex-DW-1/2  and  that  as  such  the  said  exhibit  lost  its  efficacy  given  that  no  such 

question  was  asked  in  cross-examination.  She  further  pointed  out  that  the  learned 

Appellate  Court’s  finding  that  the  Petitioner neither pleaded in his written statement 

nor  the  DWs  deposed  date,  time,  occasion  or  the  names  of  witnesses  in  whose 

presence  the  Respondent  No.1  received  back  her  dowry  articles  was erroneous as 

the  Petitioner  had  specifically  pleaded  the  same  in  his  Written  Statement.    She 

argued  that  for  all  the  foregoing  reasons  the  Impugned  Judgments  &  Decrees  are 

erroneous  and  suffer  from  misreading  and  non-reading and as such are liable to be 

set-aside.  

6. 

Despite  issuance  of  notices,  no  one  has entered appearance on behalf of the 

Respondents No. 1 & 2 and as such they were proceeded ex-parte vide order dated 

20-10-2020. 

7. 

8. 

Heard arguments. Record perused. 

First  and  foremost,  it  has  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  this  Court  in  exercise of 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  does not act like a Court of appeal.  It neither reappraises 

evidence  nor  does  it  substitute  the  concurrent  findings  of  fact  recorded  by  the 

Family  Court  with  its  own  findings  solely  on  the  ground  that  another  view  was 

possible  on  the  same  evidence.  A  party  approaching  the  High  Court  under  Article 

199  of  the  Constitution  has  to demonstrate that there is a gross misreading or non-

reading  of  evidence  or  jurisdictional  error  or  such  legal  infirmity  that  has  caused 

miscarriage  of justice.  

9. 

Though  the  Respondent  No.1  admittedly  did  not  have  proof  that  the 

Petitioner’s  salary  is  Rs.30,000/-  per  month,  the  Petitioner  himself  produced  his 

salary slip for the month of January, 2019 as Ex-DW-1/1 which shows that the total 

pay  &  allowances  aggregated  to  Rs.37,610/-  and  after  deduction/recovery  of 

Rs.6,962/-  the  net  payable  amount  was  Rs.30,648/-.  The  learned  counsel’s 

contention  that  the  Petitioner’s  basic  pay  is  Rs.21,910/-  is without merit in view of 

the  net  payable  amount.  No  other  instance  of  misreading  or  non-reading  has  been 

pointed out with regard to maintenance allowance granted by the lower courts. Even 

otherwise  I  do  not  find  the  grant  of  Rs.3,000/- per month to the Respondent No.1 

from 01-01-2012 to 25-08-2013  and Rs.5,000/- per month to the Respondent No.2 

from  the  date  of  her  birth  till  her  marriage  to  be  excessive  by  any  stretch  of 

imagination  especially  in  view  of  the  fact  that  the  learned  Appellate  Court  has 

already  shown  indulgence  to  the  Petitioner  by  reducing  the  annual  increment  fixed 

by the learned Family Court for Respondent No.2’s maintenance from 15 % to 10% 

per annum.  

10.  As far as the claim of return of dowry articles are concerned, bare perusal of 

the  relevant  paragraph of the written statement filed by the Petitioner as pointed out 

by  the  learned  counsel  shows  that  he had submitted that the Respondent No.1 had 

received  her  complete  dowry  articles  from  the  Petitioner  in  the  presence  of 

witnesses.  On  cross-examination  he  reiterated  that  Respondent  No.1  had  taken the 

dowry  articles.  Nowhere  has  he  stated  that  the dowry articles were received by the 

Respondent  No.1’s  father  or  that  the  list  produced  as  Ex-DW-1/2  was  signed  by 

him.  No  question  was  asked  in  cross-examination  of  the  PWs  No.1  &  2  as  to 

whether  or  not  Ex-DW-1/2  was  signed  by  the  Respondent  No.1’s  father.    On  the 

contrary  one  of  the  alleged  witnesses  produced  by  the  Petitioner  stated  that  the 

Respondent No.1’s father signed the list produced as Ex-DW-1/2 whereas the other 

alleged  witness  stated  that  not  only  did  the  Respondent  No.1’s  father  receive  the 

dowry articles but that he also signed the list produced as Ex-DW-1/2. On the other 

hand,  neither  the  father was summoned as a witness nor any question was asked in 

cross-examination  of  the  PWs  No.1  & 2 with regard to his or the Respondent No. 

1’s  signature  on  the  said  list  and  the  same  has  not  been  established  through  any 

other means either.    

11. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  Petitioner  has  failed to establish that the dowry 

articles,  admittedly  given  to  the  Respondent  No.1  at  the  time  of  marriage,  were 

returned  to  her  after  the  divorce  and  therefore,  no  reasonable  grounds  have  been 

made  out  for  interference  with  the  concurrent  findings  of  the  Courts  below  in 

exercise  of  writ  jurisdiction.    As  such,  the  instant  petition  is  dismissed  as  being 

devoid of merit.
