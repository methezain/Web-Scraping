Through 

instant 

petition, 

the 

petitioner  [Mst.  Parveen  Khalid],  assailed  office  order  dated  13.10.2020, 

issued by Deputy Executive Director, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences 

(PIMS),  whereby  petitioner/Mst.  Parveen  Khalid  (widow),  Mst.  Munawar 

Jan  (mother)  and  Altaf  Hussain  (father)  of  deceased  Khalid  Pervaiz  have 

been  allowed  to  draw  amount  sanctioned,  vide  Prime  Minister  Assistance 

Package  for  families  of  deceased  employees  being  legal  heirs  of  the 

deceased as declared vide Succession Certificate dated 23.09.2020. 

2. 

 As per facts, late Khalid Pervaiz an employee of Pakistan Institute of 

Medical  Sciences  (PIMS),  working  as  Ward  Boy,  died  while  in  service on 

11.07.2019.  In  accordance  with  revised  Assistance  Package  for  families  of 

government  employees,  who  die  in  service,  announced  vide  Office 

Memorandum  dated  04.12.2015  (hereinafter referred to as PM Assistance 

Package), the family of the deceased employees ranging between BPS 1 to 4 

is entitled for a  lump sum grant of Rs. 600,000/- and a grant of Rs. 2 million 

in lieu of plot. On the application of the legal heirs of the deceased Khalid 

Pervez, 

the 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III,  East-Islamabad, 

issued 

Succession  Certificate  on  23.09.2020  in  favour  of  petitioner  (Perveen 

Khalid), mother (Munawar Jan) and father (Altaf Hussain) declaring them to 

be  the  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased.    On  the  basis  of  this  Certificate 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 3098 of 2020 

Parveen Khalid v. PIMS, etc  2 

Respondent  No.  1  issued  Office  Order  dated  13.10.2020,  whereby  all  the 

three legal heirs of the deceased were allowed to draw the lump sum grant 

under  PM  Assistance  Package.  The  petitioner,  being  aggrieved  with  the 

office  order  dated  13.10.2020,  has  assailed  the  same  through  instant  writ 

petition  on  the  ground  that  the  lump  sum  grant  announced  vide  PM 

Assistance  Package,  is  not  a  tarka  left  behind  by  the  deceased  to  be 

distributed amongst the legal heirs but a right of family of the deceased and 

in  the  present  case,  petitioner  being  an  issueless  spouse  of  the  deceased  is 

the  only  eligible  legal  heir  entitled  to  receive  the  said  grant  as  father  and 

mother  of  deceased  do  not  fall  within  the  definition  of  “family”  for  the 

purpose of grant under PM Assistance Package.  

3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned Office 

Order  dated  13.10.2020,  is  arbitrary  without  any  legal  justification  against 

the  intention  of  the  government  policy  announced,  vide  PM  Assistance 

Package  for  the  families  of  the  deceased  employee  expired  during  service; 

that the grant allowed in PM Assistance Package is not a tarka wherein the 

parents  of  the  issueless  deceased  could  be  considered  as  sharer;  that  the 

Respondent Nos. 4 and 5/parents of the deceased are only entitled to receive 

share  from  the  tarka  amount  in  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  left  by 

deceased  government  employee  at  the  time  of  his  death  to  be  distributed 

according  to  the  ratio  of  shares  fixed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court  vide 

Succession  Certificate  dated  23.09.2020;  that  the  Respondent  No.1  is 

misinterpreting the contents of the Succession Certificate; that the petitioner 

is the only family member of the deceased who is entitled to draw the lump 

sum grant under PM Assistance Package. In support, learned counsel relied 

on  the  clarification  issued  by  Cabinet  Secretariat,  Establishment  Division 

dated 25.09.2003 according to which only widow/widower and children of 

the deceased  employee  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefits  of  PM  Assistance 

Package.  He  also  relied  upon  judgments  re:  Sher  Ali  v.  Director  General 

Pakistan Rangers (PLD 2019 Lahore 474) and Mst. Rabia Qavi v. Mst. Hina 

Qavi Khan (PLD 2020 Sindh 263). 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  Nos.  4  &  5 

submitted  that  vide  section  2(5)  of  the  Benevolent  Fund  and  Group 

Insurance  Act,  1969,  the  parents  of  the  deceased  are  included  in  the 

 
 
 
W.P. No. 3098 of 2020 

Parveen Khalid v. PIMS, etc  3 

definition  of  the  “family”  thus,  are  also  entitled  to  receive  the  lump  sum 

grant  under the  PM Assistance Package  as the  deceased died  issueless and 

being  legal  heir  of  the  deceased,  vide  succession  certificate  dated 

23.09.2020, his parents have every right to receive their share in the amounts 

sanctioned, vide PM Assistance Package  according to the sharing ratio. He 

relied  on  the  judgments  re:  Federal  Government  of  Pakistan  v.  Public  at 

Large  (1991  SCMR  731  Shariat  Appellate  Bench)  and  Mst.  Ameeran 

Khatoon v. Mst. Shamim Akhtar (2005 SCMR 512). 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard. Record perused.  

The controversy involved in the present petition is with regard to right 

to  receive  amount  of  grant  under  P.M.  Assistance  Package  payable  to  the 

families  of  Government  employees  who  die  in  service,  in  case  where  an 

employee  dies  issueless  whether  the  widow  of  the  deceased  would  be 

considered as only family entitled to receive the same or the grant would be 

treated  as  a  „tarka‟  distributable  among  the  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased 

declared vide succession certificate issued by the Civil Court. 

7. 

Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan,  vide  Office  Memorandum  No.  7  /  40  / 

2005-E-2,  dated  13.06.2006,  approved  the  Assistance  Package  for  families 

of  Government  Employees  who  die  in  service  which,  inter  alia,  includes 

lump sum grant, pension, plot of land, etc. This Assistance Package has been 

revised from time to time. The revised PM package enforced at the time of 

the death of the deceased  Khalid Pervaiz is dated 04.12.2015, according to 

which the family of said deceased is allowed to receive lump sum grant of 

Rs.  600,000/-  and  Rs.  2,000,000/-  in  lieu  of  allotment  of  plot.  Respondent 

No.  1,  vide  office  order  dated  13.10.2020,  has  sanctioned  the  grant  in  the 

name  of  Mst.  Parveen  Khalid  (widow/petitioner),  Mst.  Munwar  Jan 

(mother/Respondent No. 4) and Mr. Altaf Hussain (father/Respondent No.5) 

as  they  have  been  determined  as  legal  heirs  of  late  Khalid  Pervaiz,  vide 

Succession  Certificate  dated  23.09.2020.  The  contention  of  the  learned 

counsel for the petitioner is that the Assistance Package is a grant announced 

by  Prime  Minister  for  the  family  of  deceased  and  according  to  the 

clarification  issued  by  Cabinet  Secretariat,  Establishment  Division,  vide 

Office Memorandum dated 25.09.2020, only widow / widower and children 

of  the  deceased  employee  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefits  under  PM 

 
 
Assistance Package, 2015. For reference, the said clarification is reproduced 

below: 

W.P. No. 3098 of 2020 

Parveen Khalid v. PIMS, etc  4 

OFFICE MEMORANDUM 

Subject:  CLARIFICATION REGARDING ENTITLEMENT OF 
ASSISTANCE  PACKAGE  FOR  FAMILIES  OF 
GOVERNMENT  EMPLOYEES  WHO  DIE 
IN 
SERVICE. 

The  undersigned  is  directed  to  refer  to  Ministry  of 
Interior‟s O.M. No. 4/56/2011-Admn-II dated 31st August, 2020 on 
the subject noted above. 

Establishment  Division  agrees  with  the  opinion  of 
Ministry of Interior and it is clarified that only widow/widower and 
children  of  the  deceased  employee  are  entitled  to  claim  benefits 
under PMAP-2015. It is further informed that Pension will be paid 
as  per  governing  rules  of  Pension  whose  custodian  is  Finance 
Division.”. 

Plain reading of the above clarification shows that the widow of late Khalid 

Pervaiz  being  issueless  is  the  sole  beneficiary  of  the  grant  under  PM 

Assistance Package dated 04.12.2015. 

8. 

Learned counsel for the respondent challenged the above clarification 

dated  25.09.2020  and  contended  that  the  PM  Assistance  Package  has  been 

announced  for  the  family  of  the  government  employee  who  dies  during 

service and the family as per definition includes the parents of the deceased 

as  well.  He  heavily  relied  on  the  judgment  of  Shariat  Appellate  Bench, 

passed  in  case  of  Federal  Government  of  Pakistan  v.  Public  at  Large 

reported  as  (PLD  1991  SC  731)  and  referred  the  definition  of  the  term 

„family‟ vide section 2(5) of the Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance Act, 

1969 (hereinafter referred to as Act, 1969), which is as under:- 

“(5)  “family” means; 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

in the case of male employee, the wife or wives, and in the 
case of a female employee the husband of the employee; 

the  natural  sons  upto  the  age  of  twenty-one  years, 
provided  that  they  are  not  handicapped  or  mentally 
retarted; and  

parents, minor brothers, unmarried, divorced or widowed 
daughters  and  sisters  of  the  employee  wholly  dependent 
upon him.”. 

9. 

I have carefully gone through the above referred judgment relied upon 

by the learned counsel for the respondents. In this case, the Hon‟ble Shariat 

Appellate  Bench  has  interpreted  the  provisions  of  Benevolent  Fund  and 

 
 
W.P. No. 3098 of 2020 

Parveen Khalid v. PIMS, etc  5 

Group Insurance Act, 1969, in the light of Quran and Sunnah. The Hon‟ble 

Court  have  in  detail  discussed  the  assets  that  could  be  called  tarka  of  the 

deceased and that the grant of benevolent fund and group insurance, whether  

falls  within the  meaning of tarka under the Act, 1969  ibid.  While defining 

the word „tarka‟ the Hon‟ble Shariat Court by placing reliance on Surah-e-

Nisa and various Ahadees quoted by Sahaba and learned Scholars of Fiqah, 

has held that:- 

10.  The  Hon‟ble  Court,  in  the  light  of  the  concept  of  tarka  under  the 

Islamic  law  explained  the  provision  of  benevolent  fund  and  held  that  the 

grant of such benevolent fund is paid to the family of the employee who dies 

while in service or after retirement but before the age of 65 years. Section 13 

of the Benevolent Fund & Group Insurance Act 1969, has also been perused. 

According  to  which  only  those  employees  who  are  declared  completely 

incapacitated mentally or physically and unable to perform duties and retired 

or  removed  from  service  for  such  reason  are  entitled  to  receive  the  grant 

from the fund under the Act 1969 during his lifetime. It has been noted that, 
vide  sub-section  (1)  of  section  13  of  the  Act  1969,  prior  to  4th  day  of 

September  1988,  the  family  of  that  employee,  who  died  in  service  or  dies 

before attaining age of 65 years was entitled for grant and vide sub-section 

(2)  only  the  spouse  of  the  deceased  employee  who  dies  during  service  or 

after retirement but before the age of 70 years is held entitled for grant. Sub-

section  (3)  &  (4)  have  been  subsequently  added,  vide  Act  No.  IV  of  2005 

effective from 01.12.2003 which shows no change regarding the entitlement, 
however, it has been provided through 1st proviso that if the deceased has no 

spouse then in that case the other family members shall be entitled to receive

benevolent  grant  from  Benevolent  Fund.  The  employee  in  no  case  can  be 

said to be the owner of the grant from the benevolent fund and since, it is not 

payable to him during his lifetime (but subject to Section 13 of the Act) as 

held  by  the  Hon‟ble  Appellate  Shariat  Bench  the  property  (whether 

moveable  or  immoveable)  which  a person  do not own  or can claim  it  as  a 

right during his life time then the same cannot be considered a tarka of the 

deceased employee.  

11.  Similar is the opinion of the Hon‟ble Court regarding Group Insurance 

and the relevant observation is as under:- 

12.  The Hon‟ble Shariat Appellate Bench proceeded to hold that the grant 

from the fund is a donation from the employer and as such reserves right to 

give this donation to  the family member it considers entitled to receive the 

same.  The  law  of  Inheritance is  not  necessarily  applicable on  the  donation 

from  the  employer  as  it  is  not  a  “Tarka”.  The  relevant  part  is  reproduced 

below:- 

13.  Thus,  in  the  light  of  the  opinion  of  the  Hon‟ble  Shariat  Appellate 

Bench, the fund and grants announced by the employer to be paid after the

death  of  employee  during  service  to  compensate  the  untimely  death  of  the 

employee,  is  a  prerogative  and  discretion  of  the  employer  to  nominate  the 

person from his family to receive such compensation.  

14.  The  principle  laid  down  by  the  Hon‟ble  Shariat  Appellate  Bench  in 

Federal Government of Pakistan v. Public-at-Large (PLD 1991 SC 731) is 

on all force applicable to Prime Minister Assistance Package as it is a relief 

package  announced  with  the  intention  to  provide  financial  support  to 

bereaved family in the shape of a grant according to the basic scales of the 

employee. The word “grant” has been defined by the  Hon‟ble Lahore High 

Court in case re: Habib Bank Limited v. Service Fabrics Limited (2004 CLD 

1117) in the following words:- 

“The main stay of his case is upon the meaning of the word "grant". The 
learned counsel states it to mean release and disbursement of finances but 
he  has  overlooked  that  the  word "grant"  means  the  giving,  bestowing  or 
forwarding  of  a  privilege,  right,  interest,  benefit,  subsidy,  exemption, 
concession, approval, sanction or permission.”. 

15. 

In view of the judgments discussed above it is concluded that the PM 

Assistance  Package  being  a  special  grant  in  the  nature  of  death  grant,  as 

such,  it  has  been  restricted  only  for  the  families  of  those  government 

employees, who unfortunately expire while in service which cannot even be 

claimed by the family members of the government employees who die after 

retirement on attaining the age of superannuation. The deceased government 

employee thus, in no way is the owner of this grant or can claim it as a right 

or  demand  this  grant  from  the  government/employer  during  his  life  time. 

Therefore, the grant under PM Assistance Package is held not to be a tarka 

to be distributed amongst legal heirs as inheritable property. Being a special 

compensatory  package  by  the  government,  the  right  to  nominate  the 

beneficiary  to  receive  this  benefit  from  the  family  of  the  deceased  is  also 

held  by  Government  and  vide  O.M.  dated  25.09.2020,  the  issue  has  been 

resolved by clarifying that the widow/widower and children of the deceased 

have been held entitled to claim the benefits of the PM Assistance Package, 

2015. Reliance in this regard is further placed on the following cases: 

“Mst. Rabia Qavi v. Mst. Hina Qavi Khan (2020 PLD Sindh 263): 

'Tarka',  is  a  'financial  benefit'  over  and  regarding  which  a  deceased 
during his life time is not only authorized but also entitled to withdraw 
or  get  such  financial  benefits  from  the  employer.  All  other  'financial 

 
W.P. No. 3098 of 2020 

Parveen Khalid v. PIMS, etc  8 

benefits'  which  yet  to  mature  or  the  deceased  cannot  get  it  during  his 
life time do not form part of a 'Tarka'. 

Sher Ali v. Director General Pakistan Rangers (PLD 2019 Lahore 474): 

In  terms  of  the  law  enunciated  in  Federal  Government  of 
4. 
Pakistan  v.  Public-at-Large  PLD  1991  SC  731,  it  is  clear  that  only 
such  benefits  are  inheritable  that  become  receivable  by  the  deceased 
during his lifetime, i.e. payable to employee before his death. And such 
service  benefits,  as  given  by  an  employer  as  grant/compensation,  in 
lieu of death of an employee and made payable to a nominee or family - 
as  defined  under  the  relevant  rules  and  regulations  -  such  grant  or 
compensation, by its very nature, is not heritable and cannot be treated 
as  Tarka  -  estate  of  the  deceased.  In  these  circumstances,  the  service 
benefits  claimed  cannot  be 
treated  as  heritable,  being  a 
grant/compensation  accrued  after  the  death  of  deceased  employee. 
Reference  is  also  made  to  an  unreported  judgment  dated  28.01.2019 
[announced on 07.02.2019] in Writ Petition No.4167 of 2012 in case of 
"Shahbaz  Wali  Khan  v.  Government  of  Pakistan  Establishment 
Division, Regional Board Federal Employees.". 

16.  For  what  has  been  discussed  above  and  in  the  light  of  above  cited 

judgments  of  superior  courts,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  grant  under  PM 

Assistance  Package,  2015  is  not  a  tarka  and  the  petitioner  /  widow  of  the 

deceased Khalid Pervaiz is the only beneficiary of the  lump sum grant and 

the  amount,  in  lieu  of  plot,  as  clarified  vide  O.M.  dated  25.09.2020,  and 

parents of the deceased government employee are not entitled for the same. 

The petition is allowed, accordingly.
