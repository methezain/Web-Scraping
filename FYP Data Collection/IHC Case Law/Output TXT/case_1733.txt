JUDICIAL  DEPARTMENT. 

Writ Petition  No. 4030/0/2019. 

Sajid Hussain 

VS

Additional Sessions [udge-V (West), Islamabad, etc. 

Petitioner by: 

Raja Zaheer-ud-Din Babar and Mr. Akhlaq Ahmed 
Bhatti, Advocates 

Respondents: 

Barrister Ayesha Siddique Khan, State Counsel. 
Raja Tanvir Akhtar, Advocate. 
Arshad Ali, SHO P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad. 
Niaz Muhammad, ASI/1.0, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad. 

Date of Decision:  10.01.2020. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR KAY ANI,  J:-  Through  this  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner  Sajid  Hussain  has  prayed  for  quashing  of  FIR  No.510, dated 

18.11.2019,  U/S  364-A PPC,  P.S.  Tarnol,  Islamabad,  registered  on  the 

complaint of respondent  No.2/Mst. Uzma Bibi for alleged abduction of her 

two minor children namely Mujtaba Khalid and  Abdullah Khalid, who were 

removed by real father namely Muhammad Khalid. 

2. 

Learned counsel for  the  petitioner contends  that  petitioner  has  also 

assailed the  order  dated  09.11.2019, passed  by  learned  Additional Sessions 

Judge (West), Islamabad whereby direction was issued to SHO P.S. Tamol for 

registration of FIR while dealing with  the  petition  U /S  491 Cr.P.C. for  the 

recovery  of  detenues  namely  Mujtaba  Khalid,  aged  about  03  years  and 

Abdullah Khalid, aged about 01 year. 

3. 

Notices were  issued  to  respondents  Mst.  Uzma  Bibi and  SHO P.S. 

Tarnol,  who  have  put  appearance  and  stated  that  minor  children  were 

W.P  No.4030/0/2019 

2 

removed by real father of the minors Muhammad Khalid who after taking the 

custody of minors handed over the same to the present petitioner and left the 

country for his job in Saudi Arabia. 

4.  While considering the above background this Court passed the order 

dated 29.11.2019 and directed the concerned SHO to recover the minors by all 

means and  initiate action against Muhammad Khalid through  D.G. FIA as 

well as Secretary, Interior, however, on 02.12.2019 one Zahid Khan, cousin of 

present petitioner as well as minor's father put appearance and produced the 

minors namely Mujtaba Khalid and  Abdullah Khalid, handed  over to  real 

mother, therefore, other proceedings against father (Muhammad Khalid) were 

dropped. 

5. 

The only question left for determination of this Court is quashing of FIR 

which has been investigated by the 1.0 after the joining of investigation by the 

petitioner. From the perusal of record, it reveals that the minors were retained 

by Muhammad Khalid, who also put appearance before this Court today and 

contends that  his  wife left the  abode  without  minors  and  he  has  to  leave 

Pakistan for his job in Saudi Arabia, where-after minors were left at Lahore, 

however,  he  further  stated  that  his  wife  filed  frivolous  applications  for 

registration of case as well as recovery of minors despite the fact that minors 

are in Pakistan and  have not  been kidnapped.  Muhammad Khalid has also 

stated that he had divorced his wife Mst. Uzma Bibi on 27.09.2019 and as such 

minors  are  with  mother,  who  have  not  been  kidnapped  by  the  present 

petitioner Sajid Hussain. 

6.  While considering the  above background, I  have  confronted the  1.0 

regarding any evidence qua the abduction of minors by the present petitioner 

Sajid Hussain, whereby 1.0 has candidly conceded that no such evidence is 

available. It is trite law that FIR is liable to be quashed mainly on the ground 

W.P  No.4030/0/2019 

3 

that when case is of civil nature or no offence is made out or very registration 

of FIR is based  upon  malafide. Reliance is  placed  upon  2014 P.Cr.L.11361 

(Haji Zeri Gul VS Ahmad  Tan Khan), 2014 MLD  795 Peshawar  (Aftab Ahmed 

VS  State),  2014 YLR  429  Karachi  (Bashir Ahmed  VS  Vlllth  Family  ludge, 

District  West,  Karachi),  2011  SCMR  1937 (Rana  Shahid  Ahmad  Khan  VS 

Tanveer Ahmed). 

7. 

Keeping in view the above referred pronouncement of superior courts , 

the extra-ordinary exceptional circumstances exist in this case where no iota of 

evidence is available against present petitioner Sajid Hussain for abduction of 

minors rather the order which has been made basis for registration of criminal 

case  dated  09.11.2019, passed  by  learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge, 

Islamabad seems to be based upon frustration, who passed the said order just 

to  get  recovered the  minors by  all  means  in  proceedings  U/S  491  Cr.P.C. 

initiated  on  the  petition  of  Mst.  Uzma  Bibi mother  of  minors.  As  such 

petitioner  Sajid  Hussain  while  appearing  before  the  learned  Additional 

Sessions Judge, Islamabad in proceedings U/S 491 Cr.P.C. requested time and 

again and  ensured  that  he  will manage the  recovery of minors but  he  has 

failed to fulfill his commitment, which resulted into registration of FIR. 

8.  While considering the above background, order for registration of FIR 

against petitioner Sajid Hussain is considered to be an abuse of process of law 

as minors were not  in his custody, which has  been confirmed in  the police 

investigation, therefore, there is nothing left to proceed further in FIR No.510, 

dated 18.11.2019, U/S  364-A PPC, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad, as the minors have 

already been recovered and are presently with respondent  mother, however, 

real father Muhammad Khalid has put appearance and confirmed his point of 

view which also discloses that  no offence is made  out  against the petitioner 

and co-accused. As the grievance of the complainant Mst. Uzma Bibi/mother 

W.P  No.4030/0/2019 

4 

of minors was against her husband Muhammad Khalid, therefore, this Court 

comes to conclusion that  no  offence is made  out, hence, FIR No.510, dated 

18.11.2019, U/S  364-A  PPC,  P.S.  Tarnol,  Islamabad  is  hereby  quashed 

alongwith  its  order  dated  09.11.2019, which  was  passed  without  lawful 

authority by learned Additional Sessions Judge (West), Islamabad. 

9. 

Instant writ petition is allowed  in above terms.
