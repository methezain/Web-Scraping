Through  the  instant  bail  petition,  the 

petitioner  seeks  bail  after  arrest  in  case  FIR 

No.  270/2021,  dated  14.03.2021,  offence 

under  Sections 302,  324,  447,  511,  337-F(ii), 

148  &  149  P.P.C,  registered  at  Police  Station 

Koral, Islamabad. 

02. 

It  is  alleged  that  the  petitioner  along 

with  co-accused  has  attacked  on 

the 

complainant 

party 

and  made 

firing, 

consequently one  Abdul  Salam succumbed to 

the 

injuries,  whereas  Siraj-ul-Haq  and 

2 

Cr/. Misc.  1331-B 0(2021 

Muhammad  Shafique  got  injured,  hence  the 

instant FIR. 

03.  Learned  Counsel 

for  the  petitioner  / 

accused inter  alia contends that  the  petitioner 

has  falsely been implicated through  concocted 

story 

in 

the  above  mentioned  case  with 

malafide intention  by  the  complainant;  he  is  a 

law  abiding  citizen,  and  has  never  been 

involved  in  any  criminal  litigation;  there  is  no 

apprehension  of 

his 

abscondence  or 

tampering  with  the  prosecution  evidence;  he 

was  arrested  on  23.06.2021; 

there  are 

material  contradictions  between  the  medical 

and  ocular  evidence;  the  factum  of  wider  net 

is  clear  from  the  contents  of  FIR  where  the 

complainant  has  not  spared  any  member  of 

family  of  the  petitioner;  contents  of  police 

report  itself  reveal that  story  is  concocted one 

and  is  not  truly  narrated  as  per  facts  and 

there  is  a  clear  delay  in 

lodging  of  report, 

hence  he  is  entitled  for  grant  of  bail  after 

arrest. 

04.  Conversely, 

learned  State  Counsel 

assisted  by 

the 

learned  Counsel 

for 

the 

3 

Cr/. Misc. 1331-B 0(2021 

Complainant  has  controverted  the  arguments 

advanced  by  the 

learned  Counsel  for  the 

petitioner  /  accused  and  has  stated  that 

petitioner  /  accused is  specifically  nominated 

in  the  FIR;  recovery of  kalashnikov  has  been 

effected  from  him;  offences  fall  under  the 

prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497  Cr.P.C; 

sufficient  incriminating  evidence  is  available 

against him,  hence he  is  not entitled  for  grant 

of  bail  after  arrest. 

05. 

I  have  heard  the  arguments  advanced 

by  learned counsel for  the  petitioner,  learned 

State  Counsel, 

learned  Counsel 

for 

the 

complainant and perused the  record with  their 

able assistance. 

06.  The  petitioner  /  accused  is  specifically 

nominated  in  the  FIR;  he  made  direct  firing 

with  Kalashnikov on  the  chest of  Abdul Salam 

who  succumbed  to  the  injuries;  during  the 

course  of  physical  remand,  Kalashnikov  has 

been  recovered;  eye-witnesses  including  the 

injured  witnesses  have 

implicated 

the 

petitioner  I accused for  committing  murder  / 

Qatl-e-Amd  of  Abdul  Salam;  challan  in  the 

4 

Cr/. Misc.  1331-B 0(2021 

case  has  been  submitted; 

trial  has  been 

started  and  learned  trial  Court  has  recorded 

the statements of five  PWs. 

07.  Co-accused  having  different 

role  was 

allowed  bail  after  arrest  by  this  Court  vide 

order  dated  29.10.2021;  direction  has  been 

given  in  the  said  order  for  the  completion  of 

trial  within  a  period of three  (03)  months;  it  is 

further  directed  in  the  said  order  that  if  any 

accused who  have been  released on  bail  after 

arrest  do  not  appear on  any  date  of  hearing, 

their  bail  be  recalled, conclude the  trial  in  all 

respects and  compliance  report  be  furnished 

to Additional Registrar (Judicial) of this Court. 

08.  On  29.01.2022,  the  period  of 

three 

months  will  be  expired,  so  the  learned Court 

has  already been directed to  conclude the trial 

before  29.01.2022.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

complainant  present  in  the  Court  has  stated 

that  date  for  recording  the  statements  of 

remaining witnesses is  fixed  for  tomorrow  i.e. 

05.01.2022,  and all  the  prosecution witnesses 

will  be  produced  for  the  completion  of  trial 

within  the targeted  period.

09. 

It  is  well  settled  principle  of  law  that 

while  deciding  the  bail  application,  before 

recording of  evidence in  the  trial  Court,  only 

tentative  assessment is  to  be  made  by  the 

Court  and  it  is  not  permissible  to  go  into 

details  of  evidence  in  one  way  or  the  other 

that  might  prejudice the  case  of  either  party. 

In  this  regard  reliance  is  placed  upon  cases 

reported as  PLO 1994 Supreme  Court  65, 

PLO  1994  Supreme  Court  88,  2021 

SCMR 111 and 2020 SCMR 937. 

10. 

It  has  been  laid  down  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 

in 

the  cases 

reported  as  2020  SCMR 937,  2020  SCMR 

594,  2020  SCMR 1182,  2017  SCMR 325 

and 2016 SCMR 1447  that: 

"The accused are  not  entitled 

for 

the  grant  of  bail  after 

arrest  in  the  offences  falling 

under  the  prohibitory  clause 

of section  497  Cr.P.C." 

11. 

It  has  also  been 

laid  down  by 

the 

Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  a  case  titled  as 

Rehmat  Ullah  VS  State  (2011  SCMR 

1332), that: 

6 

Cr/. Misc.  1331-B 0(2021 

"The courts should not grant 

or cancel bail when the trial is 

in progress." 

12.  Considering 

the  above 

facts  and 

circumstances, I  am  clear in  my mind that  the 

petitioner/  accused has  failed to  make out  his 

case  for  grant  of  bail  on  the  ground  of further 

inquiry  as  envisaged  under  section  497(2) 

Cr.P.C,  consequently, 

instant  bail  petition 

stands dismissed. 

13.  Needless 

to  mention  that, 

this 

is  a 

tentative  assessment  which  shall  not  affect 

the trial  of case  in  any manner.
