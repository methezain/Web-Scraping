Petitioners.  

for 

the 

Through  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

assailed  Order  dated  04.02.2022 

(Impugned 

Order) 

passed 

by 

the 

learned 

Judge 

Family/Guardian Court-West, Islamabad, whereby 

interim  maintenance  of  Petitioner  No.  2  has  been 

fixed to be tune of Rs. 15000/- per month.   

2. 

As  per  contents  of  the  petition,  Petitioner 

No.1  and  the  Respondent  No.2  were  married  on 

21.02.2019 and couple moved to Saudi Arabia. On 

24.01.2020  Petitioner  No.  1  moved  back  to

with  a  son  i.e.,  Petitioner  No.  2.  On  02.09.2021 

Petitioner  No.  1  filed  a  suit  for  maintenance  for

4. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the  Petitioners 

submitted  that  the  impugned  order  is  not  tenable 

inasmuch as the interim  maintenance fixed by the 

learned trial Court is not  as  much as the financial 

status of Respondent No.2; that Respondent No. 2 

is  highly  qualified  System  Engineer,  presently 

working  at  King  Abdullah  University,  Saudi 

Arabia  and  drawing  a  handsome  monthly  salary; 

Petitioner No. 2 is the only son and financial status 

of both the parties requires enhancement in interim 

maintenance,    hence  the  impugned  order  is  liable 

to  be  set  aside  and  monthly  maintenance  of 

Petitioner No. 2 is liable to be increased as prayed 

for in the suit for recovery of maintenance.   

5. 

The  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  in 

pursuance  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act, 1964, where under the Family 

Court has the jurisdiction to pass interim order for 

maintenance  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  in  a 

suit  for  maintenance.  The  purpose  behind  the 

provision of interim  maintenance is to ensure that 

during  the  pendency  of  the  legal  proceedings,  the 

minors are not faced with financial challenges. 

6. 

Section 14  (3) of the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

against an interim order passed by a Family Court 

with the obvious purpose to avoid delays.  

7. 

Admittedly,  the  order  impugned  in  the 

instant  petition  is  interim  order  and  it  is  trite  law 

that a petition under Article 199 of the Constitution 

against  the  interim  order  is  not  maintainable  in 

 
W . P   6 9 3 / 2 0 2 2  | 3 

family  matters.  Reliance 

is  placed  on  cases 

reported as “Minhaaj Saqib and others VS Najam-

us-Saqib  and  others”  (2018  CLC  506),  and 

“Mashkoor Ahmed Khokhar VS The Family Judge 

(East),  Islamabad  and  others”  (2019  CLC  1635). 

The  maintenance  fixed  through  such  an  order  is 

only temporary. The quantum of maintenance may 

be modified after appraising the evidence produced 

at  trial.  An  aggrieved  party  will  have  a  right  to 

agitate  her  grievance  before  the  appellate  Court 

when  the  interim  order  merges  into  a  final  order. 

Even  otherwise,  quantum  of  interim  maintenance 

and  Respondent’s  financial  sttus,  being  a  factual 

dispute cannot be made a ground for invoking the 

Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.

Different  learned  Single  Benches  of  this 

Hon’ble Court in similar cases titled as Dr. Aqueel 

Waris  VS Ibrahim  Aqueel  Waris  (2020  CLC 

131),  Mashkoor  Ahmed  Khokhar VSThe 

Family Judge (East), Islamabad, 2019 CLC 1635,

Danial 

Bhatti VSAyesha Naeem, 2021 MLD 337; and 

Aamir  Munir  Puri VSMst.  Saima  Naeem, 

2021  YLR  2166,  have  held  that  interlocutory 

orders  of  Family  Court  cannot  be  assailed  in 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  the  High  court,  even 

though  they  may  be  harsh  in  some  instances. 

Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Lahore  in  judgment 

reported  as  Munir  Alam  VS  Civil  Judge,  Family 

Court,  Lahore  (2009  CLC  442)    also  declined  to 

interfere 

in 

the  order 

fixing 

the 

interim 

maintenance by Judge, Family Court by observing 

 
W . P   6 9 3 / 2 0 2 2  | 4 

that  interim  order  fixing  maintenance  temporarily 

which  could  be  modified  later  being  not  a  final 

order adversely affecting the petitioner.   

9. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  discussion  and 

keeping  in  view  the  above  said  observations,  the 

Impugned  Order  dated  04.02.2022  passed  by  the 

learned Judge Family Court, West-Islamabad, does 

not  call  for  any  interference  in  writ  jurisdiction.  

Consequently, 

this  Writ  Petition 

is  hereby 

dismissed in limine.
