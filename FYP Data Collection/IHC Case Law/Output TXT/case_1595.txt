Tipu Sultan, SJ. P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad. 

Through  this Crl. Misc., petitioner  has  prayed  for 

post-arrest  bail in case FIR No.261, dated  08.05.2020, U /S 

364-A/34 PPC, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts referred  in the instant  FIR lodged  on the 

complaint  of  Mst.  Gui  Meena/respondent  No.2  are  that 

on 08.05.2020 at about  10:45 a.m. she alongwith  her minor 

son namely  Bilal aged  about  11/12  years went  to Bhadana 

Graveyard  and  after visit of graveyard  at about  12:00 p.m. 

she was looking for taxi and walking  on the road  when  all 

of sudden  four  persons  Sher  Rehman,  her  daughter  Mst. 

Gui  Sehat  and  two  unknown  persons  armed  with  pistol 

came,  who  abducted  the  son  of  complainant  in  Toyota 

Corolla  20D  blue  colour  car  and  fled  away  from  the 

scene. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that 

petitioner  is innocent  and  has  falsely  been  implicated  in 

this  case;  that  petitioner  has  business  dispute  with 

Crl.  Misc.  No.  830/B/2020 

2 

husband  of  complainant;  that  investigation  has  been 

completed and  challan has been submitted  in the Court, 

whereby  name  of  petitioner  has  been  mentioned  in 

column No.2 of the challan; that  very registration of the 

FIR is based  upon  malafide as  husband  of complainant 

got lodged different FIR for abduction of all of his family 

members against  different individuals  in  order  to  settle 

his score which reflects the conduct of the family, which 

amounts to abuse the legal process; that CDR collected by 

the  1.0 reflects that  petitioner  was  not  available at  the 

place of occurrence and no evidence is available on record 

to connect the petitioner with the alleged offence. 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel  as  well  as 

learned  counsel  for  complainant  contend  that  minor/ 

alleged  abductee  has  not  yet  been  recovered  and  even 

business dispute has not been denied by petitioner's side; 

that  offence with  which  petitioner  has  been  charged  is 

non-bailable and falls with the ambit of prohibitory clause 

of Section 497 Cr.P.C. and as such petitioner has claimed 

ransom  from  the  complainant  which  is  evident  from 

record, therefore, petitioner is not entitled for concession 

of bail. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

The  tentative  assessment  of  record  reveals  that 

petitioner  has  been  nominated  in  the  above  mentioned 

FIR  with  specific role  of  abduction  of  minor  son  of 

complainant aged about 11/12 years on 08.05.2020 in front 

of Bhadana Graveyard on gun point.

7. 

Cursory  glimpse  of record  reflects  that  petitioner 

was  arrested  on  23.05.2020 and  remained  on  physical 

remand  for  12  days  but  nothing  incriminating  has  been 

recovered  from  him,  even  it  is  not  consumable  to  a 

prudent  mind  that  an accused in order  to abduct  a person 

may  seek  help  from  her  own  daughter  as  alleged  in  the 

FIR.  Investigation  has  been  completed  and  challan  has 

been  submitted  in the  Court,  whereby  name  of petitioner 

has been referred  in column No.2  of the challan as there is 

no  direct  evidence  against  him  surfaced  on record  as per 

stance of LO. 

8. 

The  history  of  complainant's  family  reveals  that 

different  cases  have  been  registered  on  the  complaint  of 

complainant/respondent  No.2  or  on  behalf  of  her 

husband  for her other family members,  whereby  all of her 

sons  and  daughters  were  abducted  in  different  criminal 

cases which  show  the  patron  of complainant's  side.  Such 

trail  of different  cases  got  lodged  by  complainant  is also 

not  considered  to  be  normal.  The  LO has  submitted  the 

following  details  of  different  cases,  lodged  on  behalf  of 

complainant  or her husbands-

The I.O has also confirmed that petitioner was not 

within the proximity of area when the alleged occurrence 

took  place. This fact further  clarifies the  CDR in  which 

petitioner was available in other district. All these aspects 

disclose the  case  of  further  inquiry  U /S  497(2) Cr.P.C. 

There is  no  denial  that  offence U/S  364-A PPC is  non- 

bailable and non-compoundable, however, when case falls 

within the ambit of further inquiry, bail could be granted, 

even there is no bar for grant of bail in such type of cases. 

The  petitioner  is  no  more  required  for  the  purpose  of 

investigation and  he  is behind  the  bars  for  the  last  two 

and half months and as such no useful purpose would be 

achieved by keeping him behind the bars. 

11. 

In view of above, instant  petition is allowed  and 

the petitioner is admitted to post arrest bail subject to his 

furnishing  of  bail  bonds  in  the  sum  of  Rs.5,00,000/- 

(Rupees Five Lac only) with one surety in the like amount 

to the satisfaction of learned trial Court.
