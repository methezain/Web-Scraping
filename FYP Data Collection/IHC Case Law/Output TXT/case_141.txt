order/ 
Proceedings 
23.02.2023  Nemo for the petitioner. 

Mr.  Asim  Riaz  Awan  and  Raja  Saif-ur-
Rehman, Advocates for respondent No.1. 

Today,  the  case  was  called  on  its 

turn as well as before the rising of the Court, 

but  on  both  occasions,  no  one  tendered 

appearance  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner.  The 

name of learned counsel for the petitioner is 

reflected  in  the  cause  list.  There  is  no 

application  for  an  adjournment,  therefore, 

the  instant  petition  is  dismissed  for  non-

prosecution.
