8. 

Brief facts referred in the captioned W.P.  No.2431a019  (Nazir Atta  Shah VS 

FOP,  etc.),  are  that  the  petitioner  has  prayed  for  issuance of  direction  to  the 

respondents  for  implementation  of  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package  in 

accordance with OM No.8/10/2013 E.2/Pf, dated 02.10.2014 with the contention 

that  the  petitioner  is the  widow  of Ata Ullah Shah, who  was  serving as Chief 

System Analyst with Respondents No.2, 4 & 6, who died in service on 18.03.2014 

due  to natural  death  and  petitioner being widow  of the  deceased employee is 

entitled  to  get  benefit of Prime Minister Assistance Package, 2014, but  due  to 

budgetary constraints of the respondent department the financial benefits could 

not be extended. 

9. 

Brief facts referred in the captioned in W.P. No  1101ao19  (Mst.  Samia Bibi 

VS  FOP,  etc.),  are  that  the  petitioner  is claiming the  benefit of Prime  Minister 

Assistance Package on behalf of her  deceased father  Muhammad  Rashid, who

due  to  natural  death  and  after  the  death  of  Muhammad  Rashid, his  widow 

namely Shireen Akhtar  also died  on  29.08.2018, leaving behind  the  legal heirs 

including the petitioner, to whom the relief of Prime Minister Assistance Package 

has  not  yet  been  cleared  due  to  non-availability of  funds  by  the  respondent 

department. 

10. 

Brief facts referred in the captioned in W.P. No.444Bao19  (Naheed Akhtar  v. 

FOP, etc.) are that  the petitioner i.e. sister of Rukhsana Mushtaq claims that her 

sister  Rukhsana  Mustahaq,  who  was  working  under  the  control  of  General 

Headquarters  in  BPS-14, died  on  18.10.2014,  and  she  is  entitled  for  Prime 

Minister Assistance Package of 2014, but  the  funds  were  not  arranged  by  the 

respondent department.

11. 

Learned counsel for  petitioners in WPs No.1104, 1106, 1107, 1108, 1110, 

2431  & 4448 of 2019 contend that the respondent authorities while deciding the 

case of petitioners have ignored the interregnum period of the two packages i.e. 

Prime Minister Assistance Package, 2014 and Prime Minister Assistance Package, 

2015,  in  which  the  cases  of  petitioners  fall; that  several  cases  of  families of 

deceased employees falling in the said interregnum period  have been extended 

benefit  of  Prime  Minister  Assistance Package, 2014, but  the  petitioners  have 

deprived  of such benefits, rather their cases have unlawfully been dealt with in 

accordance with  Prime  Minister  Assistance Package, 2006; that  this  Hon'ble 

Court  has  also settled  this  question  in  abundant  writ  petitions while  granting 

relief  to  such  families  of  deceased  employees  in  accordance with  the  Prime 

Minister Assistance Package, 2014. 

12. 

Likewise, learned  counsel for petitioner in  W.P. No.1829/2019 contends 

that  the  act  of  respondents  (AIOU) depriving  the  petitioner  for  appointment 

together with other monetary benefits as per Prime Minister Assistance Package, 

2017 is against the law and natural justice as the petitioner fulfills the minimum 

criteria for appointment  against a  suitable post; that  the apex Court  as well as 

superior  Courts  held  in  various  judgments  that  dependent/legal  heir  of  a 

deceased Work  Charge  Employee is  entitled  of  all  financial benefits but  the 

petitioner  has  been  deprived  of  such  benefits by  the  respondent  department, 

which act is a sheer violation of fundamental rights of petitioner. 

13. 

Conversely, learned AAG along with Section Officer, Established Division 

and  learned  counsel  for  Ministry  of  Railways contended  that  legal  heir  of 

deceased employees have received the benefits as per Prime Minister Assistance 

Package and nothing is outstanding against the answering departments; that the 

0.M. dated 24.10.2014 notifying the Prime Minister Assistance Package, 2014 was 

WPs  No.1104,  1106,  1107,  1108,  1110,  1829,  2431  & 4448 of2019 

Page  I  6 

already  held  in abeyance  by the  then  Prime Minister  and  as such, no  legal right 

has accrued  in favour  of the petitioners;  that  the petitioners  moved  this Court by 

concealing the  facts, rather  tried  to mislead  the  Court  in order  to  get benefits of 

the  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package to which  they  are  not  entitled,  therefore, 

the captioned  writ  petitions  may be dismissed. 

14. 

In  addition,  learned  counsel  for  AIOU  while  opposing  the  captioned 

W.P.  No.1829/2019  contended  that  the  same  is  not  maintainable  as  the  rules 

relating  to the  terms  and  conditions  of services are  non-statutory  in nature;  that 

constitutional  jurisdiction  is a discretionary  jurisdiction  and  the same may not be 

exercised in favour  of a person  who  has no legs to stand  and  is, therefore,  liable 

to  be  dismissed;  that  only  regular  employees  working  in  AIOU are  entitled  to 

draw  the benefits of the Prime Minister Assistance Package, whereas  petitioner's 

father had  been working  on Daily Wages Basis, therefore,  petitioner's  request  for 

such monetary  benefits was turned  down for not being covered under  the rules. 

15. 

Likewise, the  learned  AAG along  with  DSP Legal in  attendance  contend 

that  benefits  of  the  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package,  2014, dated  20.10.2014, 

applicable  to  the  employees  of  Islamabad  Police  Department  will  be  released 

subject to  fulfillment  of codal  formalities  of law  after  receiving  funds  from  the 

Finance Division. 

16. 

Respondents  No.1 and  2 i.e.  Ministry of Defence and GHQ submitted  their 

para-wise  comments  in  W.P.  No.4448/2019  and  have  acknowledged  that  the 

deceased  being  a  civil  servant  died  on  18.10.2014, but  she  was  unmarried  and 

under  the law  her  father  Mushtaq  Ali Khan was  the  legal heir,  in whose  favour 

the  amount  had  been  forwarded  vide  letter  dated  25.06.2019, but  he  could  not 

claim  some  benefits  due  to  his  own  death  and  the  legal  heirs  of  Mushtaq  Ali 

Khan  i.e.  family  members  were  directed  to  produce  succession  certificate  from 

WPs  No.1104,  1106,  1107,  1108,  1110,  1829,  2431  & 4448 of 2019 

Page  I  7 

competent  court  of  law,  whereafter  the  due  payment  will  be  released  under 

the law. 

17. 

Arguments  heard,  record perused. 

18. 

Perusal of record  reveals that the petitioners  are claiming benefits of Prime 

Minister Assistance Package, 2014, notified vide O.M. dated  20.10.2014, on behalf 

of their  deceased  predecessors,  who  have  been  confirmed  as civil servants  and 

respondent  departments  have acknowledged  the rights of deceased civil servants 

falling under  the Prime Minister Assistance Package. 

19. 

The case of Muhammad  Yasir in W.P. No.1829/2019 is related  to Allama 

Iqbal  Open  University,  in  which  the  deceased  employee  namely  Muhammad 

Qasim  while  serving  as  LDC on  Daily  Wages  basis  died  on  17.01.2019 and  as 

such,  the  respondent  University  has  adopted  the  Prime  Minister  Assistance 

Package,  however  as  per  the  para-wise  comments  filed  by  the  respondent 

University,  the  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package  is applicable  only  to regular 

employees  of  the  University  and  since  the  deceased  Muhammad  Qasim  was 

serving on Daily Wages Basis, the package could not be applicable to him despite 

the fact that he was working  w.e.f. 04.10.2004 as per the stance of the respondent 

University. I have  gone through  the para-wise  comments  and  the Prime Minister 

Assistance Package, which  deals  with  the  employees  without  any  distinction  of 

permanent  or  temporary  or  daily  wages  basis.  Similarly,  the  AIOU  has  also 

notified  the  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package  through  notification  dated 

19.07.2017 in  restrictive  manner,  but  no  distinction  has  been  referred  that  the 

adopted  package by the AIOU is applicable to regular  employees  only, even such 

aspect  has  not  been  discussed  in  the  Executive  Council  of  the  AIOU  in  its 

meeting, therefore,  this aspect requires  determination. 

WPs  No.1104,  1106, 1107, 1108, 1110, 1829, 2431 & 4448 of 2019 

Page  I  8 

20. 

It  is  settled  by  different pronouncements  of the  superior  Courts  that  a 

daily wager  employee, who  has  performed work  for 89 days with  an  artificial 

break created by the department,  is considered to be regular  employee and  he 

could not be deprived of his rights. In such scenario, the Executive Council of the 

AIOU is directed to decide the case of Muhammad Yasir independently  in the 

next Executive Council meeting with reasons, under  intimation to this Court, as 

to why an employee working on daily wages and  has performed his duties for 

more  than  20  years  in  the  respondent  University  could  be  discriminated  to 

permanent  employees, especially when  he  lost  his  life serving  the  respondent 

University and  leaving his family to suffer thereafter on their own without  any 

support from the respondent University, unlikely in case of family members of a 

permanent employee of the respondent University. 

21. 

In view of above terms, the captioned W.P. No.1829a019  (Muhammad  Yasir 

v. Allama  Iqbal  Open  University  & 2 others)  is hereby DISPOSED  OF. 

22.  While considering the stance taken by the respondents in their para-wise 

comments  as  well  as  before  this  Court,  which  have  been  recorded  in 

abovementioned paragraphs, this Court, vide order dated 17.10.2017, had earlier 

allowed a similar writ petition i.e. W.P. No.No.515/2017 along with 20 other writ 

petitions, and  the said order was upheld  by the Hon'ble Division Bench of this 

Court  as  well  as  by  the  apex  Court  and  as  such, the  cases of  petitioners  fall 

within  the  purview  of judgment  rendered  by  this  Court  in  abovementioned 

cases. However,  at  this  stage,  in  majority  of  cases,., the  question  of  funds  is 

involved and  the matter  is pending with  the Finance Division, therefore, while 

considering  memorandum  dated  11.06.2018,  the  Cabinet  Secretariat, 

WPs  No.1104,  1106,  1107,  1108,  1110,  1829,  2431  & 4448 of 2019
