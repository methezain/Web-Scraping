MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  this  judgment  I 

propose  to  decide  writ  petitions  No.3834  and  3886  of  2021  since  they 

entail certain common features.  

2.  Writ petition No.3834/2021 has been filed by Mst. Sidrah Shoukat 

(“Mst.  Sidrah”)  and  her  minor  daughter,  Aaminah  Azeem,  against  the 

consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated  27.09.2021  passed  by  the 

Court of the learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad whereby the 

appeal  filed  by  them  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

25.10.2019 passed by the learned Judge Family Court, Islamabad was 

dismissed.  In  the  said  judgment  and  decree  dated  25.10.2019,  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  had  partially  decreed  the  suit  filed  by  the 

said  petitioners  for  recovery  of  maintenance,  dower,  dowry,  recovery 

of  passport  and  gold  ornaments.  The  decree  was  to  the  extent  of 

maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.20,000/-  per  month  to  petitioner  No.2, 

Aaminah  Azeem  with  a  10%  annual  increase  with  effect  from  April 

2017.  

3. 

Through  writ  petition  No.3886/2021,  the  petitioner,  Major  Azeem 

Ahmad  (“Major  Azeem”),  impugns  the  consolidated  judgment  and 

decree dated 27.09.2021 passed by the Court of the learned Additional 

District  Judge,  Islamabad  whereby  the  appeal  filed  by  the  said 

petitioner  against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  25.10.2019  passed 

by the learned Judge Family Court was dismissed.

4. 

The record shows that Major Azeem and Mst. Sidrah got married 

on  10.05.2015.  The  couple  were  blessed  with  one  daughter,  Aaminah 

Azeem,  who  is  presently  six  years  of  age.  After  the  relations  between 

the couple turned sour, Mst. Sidrah had to leave her matrimonial abode 

and  live  with  her  parents.  This  caused  Major  Azeem  to  file  a  suit  for 

restitution of conjugal rights on 07.04.2018. In the reply to the said suit, 

Mst. Sidrah sought the dissolution of marriage. In the said reply, it was 

pleaded inter alia  that  Major  Azeem  had  caused  physical  cruelty  and 

mental torture to Mst. Sidrah. The proceedings culminated in the order 

dated 26.04.2018 whereby the suit for restitution of conjugal rights was 

dismissed and a decree for the dissolution of the marriage was issued 

on the basis of khula. There is nothing on the record to show that either 

of the contesting parties had assailed the said decree.  

5. 

On  24.10.2017,  Mst.  Sidrah  and  Aaminah  Azeem  had  filed  a  suit 

for  recovery  of  maintenance  etc.  against  Major  Azeem  before  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad.  The  trial  in  the  said  suit 

culminated in the judgment and decree dated 25.10.2019 whereby the 

said  suit  was  decreed  only  to  the  extent  of maintenance at  the  rate  of 

Rs.20,000/-  payable to  Aaminah  Azeem  with  10% annual  increase  with 

effect from April 2017. The said judgment and decree was assailed by 

Major  Azeem  as  well  as  Mst.  Sidrah  and  Aaminah  Azeem  in  two 

separate  appeals.  Vide  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.09.2021,  both 

the  appeals  were  dismissed.  Writ  petition 

No.3834/2021  has  been  filed  by  Mst.  Sidrah  and  Aaminah  Azeem 

whereas  writ  petition  No.3886/2021  has  been  filed  by  Major  Azeem 

against the said consolidated judgment and decree dated 27.09.2021. 

6. 

Learned  counsel  for  Mst.  Sidrah  and  Aaminah  Azeem  submitted 

that  Mst.  Sidrah  in  her  reply  to  Major  Azeem’s  suit  for  conjugal  rights 

had specifically pleaded that she had been forced to leave matrimonial 

abode  due  to  physical  cruelty  inflicted  on  her  by  Major  Azeem;  that 

since Mst. Sidrah had been forced to leave her matrimonial abode, the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  should  have  passed  a  decree  for  the 

payment  of  the  remaining  dower  amounting  to  Rs.2,00,000/-  in  her 

favour;  that  there  was  no  proof  on  the  record  to  show  that  other  than 

Rs.10,000/-  which  was  paid  to  Mst.  Sidrah  at  the  time  of  nikah,  the 

remaining  amount  of  Rs.2,00,000/-  had  been  paid  to  her  at  any  stage; 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

W.P. No.3834/2021 &  
  3886/2021 

that the learned Courts below concurrently erred by not issuing orders 

for  the  return  of  Mst.  Sidrah’s  gold  ornaments  and  passport;  that  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  ought  to  have  granted  a  decree  for  the 

payment of maintenance in favour of Mst. Sidrah until the expiry of the 

iddat period; and that the quantum of maintenance fixed by the learned 

Judge Family Court for Aaminah Azeem was too low and could not meet 

her needs at this day and age of rampant inflation. Learned counsel for 

Mst.  Sidrah  and  Aaminah  Azeem  prayed  for  their  writ  petition  to  be 

allowed  in  terms  of  the  relief  sought  therein  and  for  writ  petition  of 

Major Azeem to be dismissed. 

7. 

On  the  other  hand,  Major  Azeem  appeared 

in-person  and 

submitted that the quantum of maintenance fixed by the learned Judge 

Family  Court  for  his  daughter  was  too  high  and  unaffordable  for  him 

given his meager salary paid to him by the Pakistan Army;  and that he 

had  also  to  support  his  parents  and  new  family  from  his  salary.  He 

prayed for the concurrent judgments of the learned Courts below to be 

modified  and  the  quantum  of  maintenance  for  his  own  daughter  to  be 

reduced.  He  further  submitted  that  the  rejection  of  all  other  claims 

made  in  the  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  do  not  suffer  from  any 

jurisdictional infirmity. 

8. 

In rejoinder, learned counsel for Mst. Sidrah and Aaminah Azeem 

submitted that the decree was for Rs.20,000/- with annual increment at 

the  rate  of  10%  per  annum  but  Major  Azeem  had  not  paid  the 

incremental amount at any stage. 

9. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  Mst. 

Sidrah and Aaminah Azeem as well as Major Azeem (who has appeared 

in-person) and have perused the record with their able assistance. The 

facts  leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have  been  set  out  in 

sufficient  detail 

in  paragraphs  4  to  5  above  and  need  not  be 

recapitulated. 

10.  The learned Courts below had concurrently concluded that since 

Mst.  Sidrah  had  obtained  a  decree  for  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the 

basis  of  khula  in  terms  of  Section  10(4)  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  she  was  under  an  obligation  to  return  the  dower 

received  by  her.  This  finding  caused  the  learned  Courts  below  to turn 

down  Mst.  Sidrah’s  claim  for  the  recovery  of  dower  amounting  to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

W.P. No.3834/2021 &  
  3886/2021 

Rs.2,00,000/-. It is not disputed that the learned Judge Family Court, on 

26.04.2018  (i.e.,  after  the  institution  of  the  suit  for  recovery)  had 

passed  a decree for  the  dissolution  of marriage on the  basis  of khula. 

Mst.  Sidrah  did  not  assail  the  said  decree  or  assert  that  the  marriage 

should  have  been  dissolved  on  the  basis  of  cruelty  inflicted  on  her  by 

Major  Azeem.  Therefore,  I  have  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the 

concurrent findings that Mst. Sidrah was not entitled to the recovery of 

deferred dower amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-. 

11.  The  factual  aspects  regarding  the  recovery  of  gold  ornaments 

and  dowry  articles  have  been  adequately  dealt  with  by  the  learned 

Courts below and warrant no interference.  

12.  As  regards  Mst.  Sidrah’s  assertion  that  the  quantum  of 

maintenance  for  Aaminah  Azeem  should  have  been  enhanced  by  the 

learned  Appellate  Court,  suffice  it  to  say  that  the  maintenance  is  not 

just for Rs.20,000/- per month with effect from April 2017 but also with 

an  annual  increment  of  10%  per  annum.  Although  given  the  present 

inflation,  the  said  amount  may  not  be  sufficient  for  a  school  going  six-

year  old  child  but  since  two  fora  below  have  endorsed  the  said 

maintenance, I am not inclined to interfere with the same. Major Azeem, 

however,  remains  bound  to  pay  the  maintenance  to  his  daughter 

strictly  in  accordance  with  the  judgments  and  decrees  passed  by  the 

learned Courts below. 

13.  Since I do not find any jurisdictional irregularity in the concurrent 

judgments  and  decrees  passed  by  the learned  Courts  below,  both  the 

writ petitions are dismissed with no order as to costs. Office is directed 

to transmit a copy of this order to the learned Executing Court.
