petitioner. 

C.M.No.461/2022 

Through 

the 

instant  application, 

the 

petitioner  /  applicant  seeks  an  order  to  suspend 

the execution proceedings.  

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was 

asked  whether  any  visitation  had  taken  place 

between  respondent  No.3  and  her  three  minor 

children since the date when they were alleged to 

have  been  snatched 

/ 

taken  away  by 

the 

petitioner.  Since  the  response  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  was  in  the  negative,  I 

am  not  inclined  to  show  any  indulgence  to  the 

petitioner.  

It  is  imperative  that  a  bond  should  be 

created  between  respondent  No.3  and  her  three 

minor  children  specially  since  there  has  been  no 

visitation between them since the past more than 

two years. It is only after the minors live with their 

mother  that  this  Court  can  take  an  informed 

decision  whether  the  learned  Courts  below  had 

concurrently erred by giving custody of the minor 

children to their mother / respondent No.3. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  application  for 

suspending 

the  execution  proceedings 

is 

dismissed. Office is directed to transmit a copy of 

this order to the learned Executing Court.
