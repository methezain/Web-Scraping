Nemo for  respondent No.2. 

Mr.  Fahad  Ali, learned State Counsel. 

Ameer  Ali,  A.S.I.  Police  Station  Koral, 
Islamabad. 

Through 

the 

instant  petition, 

the 

petitioner  seeks bail before arrest  in  a  case 

F.l.R.  No.  668/21,  dated  26.07.2021, 

offence under section 324, 337-F(ii)  P.P.C., 

registered  at 

Police  Station  Koral, 

Islamabad. 

02.  Earlier  petition 

for  pre-arrest  bail 

filed  by 

the  petitioner/accused  was 

dismissed  by 

the  Court  of 

learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge-IV, 

East- 

Islamabad vide order dated 29.11.2021. 

03.  The  petitioner  has  been  involved  on 

2 

Cr/.  Misc. No. 1283 of2021 

a  statement 

in  cross-version  of  one 

Muhammad  zeeshan  ex-husband  of  the 

petitioner,  wherein  it  is  alleged  that  the 

petitioner  has  inflicted firearm  injury  on  his 

body, hence the  instant FIR. 

04.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter  alia,  contends  that  the  petitioner  is 

innocent;  she  has  not  committed  any 

offence  rather  the  complainant  of  cross 

version is  the  main accused in  FIR  who has 

caused  three  firearm 

injuries  upon  the 

petitioner;  Muhamoiad  Zeeshan  is 

the 

aggressor  and  entered  into  house  of  the 

petitioner;  there  is  no  evidence  available 

against her,  hence she is  entitled  for  grant 

of  bail  before arrest. 

05.  Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel 

states 

that  Muhammad  Zeeshan  has 

received 

firearm 

injuries  during 

the 

occurrence,  petitioner 

is  nominated 

in 

cross-version, hence she is  not  entitled  for 

concession of  bail  before arrest. 

06.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

07.  The  petitioner  is  complainant  of  FIR 

3 

Cr/.  Misc. No. 1283 of 2021 

No.  668 of  2021,  wherein  she  has  alleged 

that  on  26.7.2021,  at  about  01:15  PM 

Muhammad Zeeshan /  accused who  is  her 

ex-husband,  entered  into  her  house  to 

take  his  son  aged  about  six  years  forcibly 

and  during  exchange  of  harsh  words,  he 

hit  the  petitioner  with  pistol  butt  on  her 

head;  he  also  made  firing  upon  her  and 

caused three  firearm  injuries  on  her  both 

legs.  Muhammad  Zeeshan  has 

been 

arrested  and  pistols  have  been  recovered 

by  police from  the place of occurrence. 

08.  On  the  same day  at  about  6:00  PM, 

Muhammad  Zeeshan  has  also  recorded 

counter-version,  wherein  he  has  stated 

that  the  petitioner  is  her  ex-wife  and  he 

went to  her house to take  his  son  from  the 

petitioner  but  during  exchange  of  harsh 

words,  the  petitioner  made  firing  with 

pistol and caused him  injury. 

09. 

It 

is  admitted 

that  Muhammad 

Zeeshan  is 

the  aggressor;  he 

forcibly 

entered  into  the  house of  his  ex-wife;  he 

has  also  mentioned  in  his  statement  that 

4 

Cr/.  Misc. No. 1283 0(2021 

the  petitioner  took  his  son  from  the  school 

few  days back without  his  consent. In  such 

situation  Muhammad Zeeshan was liable to 

file  a  petition  under section 491  Cr.P.C.  or 

to  approach  the 

learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  Islamabad  but  he  opted  not  to 

adopt 

the 

legal  course  rather 

forcibly 

entered  into  house  of  the  petitioner  with 

pistols and made firing  on  her legs. 

10.  The  occurrence 

took 

place 

on 

26.07.2021,  now  after  the  delay  of  08 

months,  no  question  of  recovery  of  pistol 

from  the  petitioner  arises  arid  if  some 

recovery is  planted,  the  same will  have  no 

evidentiary value at this  belated stage. 

11. 

I.O  has  stated  that 

there 

is  no 

independent evidence available against the 

petitioner 

except 

the 

statement 

of 

Muhammad  Zeeshan;  inhabitants  of  the 

locality  have  also  informed  the  I.O  that 

Muhammad Zeeshan forcibly  entered  into 

house  of  the  petitioner  and  then  they 

heard noise  of firing  from  the  house. 

12.  The  petitioner 

is  also  critically 

5 

Cr/.  Misc. No. 1283 0(2021 

injured;  she has  appeared in  the  Court on 

wheelchair and as  per record she is  getting 

medical 

treatment 

from 

the  surgical 

department  of  local  hospital. 

13. 

In  view  of  the  law  laid  down  by the 

Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in 

cases  titled  as  "Shahzada Qaiser Arfat 

@  Qaiser  VS  The State,  etc. "  (PLO 

2021  SC 708),  ''Khair Muhammad and 

another  VS  The State  through  P.G. 

Punjab  and  another"  (2021  SCMR 

130), "Khalil  Ahmed  Soomro  and 

others  VS  The  State"  (PLO  2017 

Suoreme Court 730), and  the  facts  and 

circumstances of  the  case, if the  petitioner 

being injured  lady /  mother  of  a  minor son 

is  sent behind the  bars, no fruitful  purpose 

will  be  served. Admittedly,  the  petitioner  is 

previously non-convict,  she is  not  involved 

in  any  other  case  and  if  her  bail  before 

arrest  is  declined,  it  will  cause  irreparable 

loss  to  her person, reputation and career. 

14. 

For  the  reasons recorded above, this 

petition  is  allowed  and  ad-interim  pre- 

6 

Cr/.  Misc. No. 1283 of2021 

arrest bail  already granted  to  the  petitioner 

vide  order  dated  02.12.2021,  is  hereby 

confirmed subject  to  furnishing  of  fresh 

bail  bonds in  the  sum  of  Rs. 1,00,000/- 

(One  Hundred  Thousand  only)  with  one 

surety 

in 

the 

like  amount 

to 

the 

satisfaction of  learned trial  Court. 

15.  Needless to  mention  that,  this  is  a 

tentative  assessment which shall not affect 

the trial  of case in  any manner. 

16.  All 

the  pending  applications  are 

disposed of, accordingly.
