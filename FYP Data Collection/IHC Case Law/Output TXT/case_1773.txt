Proceedings
07.'11.2019 Mr. Javed lqbal Bandey, Advocate for petitioner,

Respondent  No.1 ln Person.

Through this judgment, I propose  to decide
Writ Petition  No. 282712019  and Writ Petition No.
3198,2019  since  they entail common questions of
law and fact.
2.  Through Writ Petition No. 282712019  the
petitioner  (Mst. Raiya)  assails the order  dated
20.05.20'|.9,  passed  by the learned Judge Family
Court, lslamabad-West. Through the said order
dated 20.05.2019 the learned Family Court
reviewed its earlier order dated  06.03.2019 to the
extent that the venue of meeting between  the
minors  and their father i.e. respondent  No.1 was
changed from Court precincts to Centuarus  Mall,
lslamabad.
3.  Through Writ Petition No. 3190f2019,  the
petitioner (Hammad  Hussain)  also assails the order
dated 20.05.20,,19  which  has been assailed  in the
Writ Petition No. 282712019.  Mst. Raiya shall be
referred  to as the "petitioner"  whereas Hammad
Hussain shall  be referred  to as "respondent  No.1".
4.  The facts essential for the disposal of the
instant petition are that the petitioner  and
respondent  No.1 are ex husband and wife. Their
divorce took place on 17.04.2018.  During the
subsistence  of the marriage the couple  were
blessed  with two sons namely,  Muhammad  Affan
Butt and Muhammad  Abdullah Butt,born on
08.11 .2016 and 19.03.3018,  respectively.

5.  On 1307.2019  respondent No.1 filed petition
under section  25 of the Guardian and Wards Act,
1890 ("the 1890 Act") for the custody of the minors
before the learned Judge  Family Court.  Alongwith
the said petition, respondent No.1 also filed an
application under section 12 ol the 1890 Act for
interim custody  of the minors and for weekly
meetings.
6.  Vide order dated 06.03.2009,  the learned
Judge  Family Court  dismissed  respondent  No.1's
application  under section  '12 of the 1890 Act and
fixed a schedule of visitation between the minors
with respondent  No.1 on first and third Saturday of
every month from 10:00 a.m. to 02:00 P.fi., at the
Court premises, in the presence of the bailiff.
7.  On 20.05.2019 respondent  No.1 moved an
application for review  of order  dated 06.03.2019  to
the extent of venue of meeting with the minors.
Respondent No.1  in the said application  prayed for
the change of venue from the Gourt premises to his
house.  The said application was disposed  of by the
learned Judge Family  Court vide impugned order
dated 20.05.2019,  whereby  the venue of meeting
was changed  from the Court premises to the
"Centaurus Mall" lslamabad,  in presence of bailiff.
The said order dated 20.05.2019 has been
impugned in these petitions.
8. 
lt appears that both the contesting  parties
preferred appeals against the impugned  order
dated 20.05.2019 before  the Court of the learned
District Judge. Vide order dated  13.07.20.,19, the
said appeals  were disposed of by holding that the
same were not maintainable against an interim
order.
9.  Learned  counsel for the petitioner  after
narrating the facts leading to the filing of instant
petition, submitted  that the learned  Judge Family
Court  erred by not appreciating that a shopping
mall is not an appropriate  place for meeting
between the minors with respondent No.1; that the

W.P. No.282712019

Court did not speciff any place in the Centaurus
Mall as the place of meeting; that a business center
is not an appropriate  place for meeting  with young
children; that the learned  trial Court did not obtain
the consent  of the petitioner  while fixing the venue
for the meetings;  that due to the previous conduct
of respondent  No.1,  there was an apprehension that
he may take away the minors;  that respondent
No.1's house is not a suitable place for meeting with
the minors as it would  expose  the children to the
hostilities of a step mother; that no opportunity was
given to the petitioner to file a reply to respondent
No.1's  application;  that there was no need  to
change the venue of meeting  as previous meetings
in the Court  premises were calm and secure;  and
that the impugned order is not sustainable  under
the law. Learned counsel  prayed  for the writ
petition to be allowed  and the impugned order
dated 20.05.20',9  to be set aside.
10. On the other hand, respondent  No.1 appeared
in person and contended  that the welfare of the
minors  rests in getting  love and affection of their
father; that both in religious  terms and in legal
terms a father  is entitled to meet  the children  more
often than the schedule fixed under the order dated
06.03.2019; that the Court premises are not an
appropriate  place for meeting with the minors; that
the petitioner i.e mother of minors did not bring the
children  on half of the dates scheduled for meetings
since visitation  order dated 06.03.2019  was passed;
that after the passing of the impugned  order  dated
20.05.2019,  the petitioner did not produce the
minors for meeting; that a shopping  mall being a
crowded  place would  not be a proper venue for
meeting;  that respondent No.1's house is the most
conducive venue for the welfare of minors as they
would be able to develop  a bond with their father;
and that the grounds  taken by the petitioner are
speculative and based on mala fide.

11. I have heard the contentions  of the learned
counsel  for the petitioner  as well as respondent
No.1 in person  and perused  the record.
12. The facts leading to the filing of the instant
petition have been set out in sufficient  detail in
paragraphs 3  to  Tabove, and need not be
recapitulated.
13. Although  the order dated 20.05.2019  which
has been impugned is interim in nature, however,
since welfare of minors is basic consideration  in
guardianship matters,  this Court cannot  remain
unmindful of the objections  by both the parties
against the said order regarding the venue of
meeting.
14. Since  the minors are aged less than three
years, at this stage,  they require the affection of
both the parents.  The minors are in the petitioner's
custody.  Despite the divorce  between  the parents,
the minors  cannot be deprived  of the natural
affinity, love and affection of their father.  The
purpose of respondent No.1's meeting with the
minors is to develop a parental bond with the
children, and to avoid estrangement  between them.
This objective  cannot  be achieved  without ensuring
that the meeting of the father and children takes
place in  a  suitably congenial and homely
environment. !n the absence of extraordinary
circumstances, the Court premises as venue of
meeting with minors, are neither congenial  nor
appropriate.  Law to this effect has been laid down
in case of Umar Farooq VS Khushbakhat  Mirza  etc
(PLD  2008 Lahore 527). wherein  it has been  held  as

follows;-

"lt is an inherent  right of the contesting
parent  to seek visitation  to the minor, especlally  a
father,  who is the natural guardian, he not only is
reguired to participate  in the up-brinaing  of the
minors.  but should  develop love. bondage and
afllnity with them. to achieve this purpose.  the
concerned  Court should facilltate a conaenial.
homely  and friendly  environment and a reasonable

W.P. No.282712019

t

visitation schedule.  The Court of the Guardian
Judge, for this purpose  is neither conducive nor
effective, it  lacks proper facllities and
arrangements,  and is not comparable  to a homely
envlronment. Thus, meeting  in Court  premlses
does not serve the purpose of meeting.  lt,
therefore, is not in the interest or welfare of the
minors to hold meetings  in Court  premises.  Thus,
meetings of minors with parents should  preferably
be held at the premises  of the contestina parent to
familiarlze  the minors with the environment  there.
to strengthen a healthy relationship and dispel
fears of a future re-union and only in extreme and
exceptional cases  the Court  of the Guardian  Judae
be chosen  aq a venue for which  detalled reasons
should be cited,  thus,  a mechanical  order,  in this
context  ls not tenable. {Emphasis  added)

15.  Through the  impugned order  dated
20.05.20'19,  learned Family Court did not speciff
any area  in the Centaurus  Mall to be designated  as
venue for meeting. lt can safely be held that this
ambiguity  in the impugned order can give rise to
variety  of complications.  Even otherwise,  both
parties have objected  to the venue  of meeting to be
a shopping  mall as the same  cannot be considered
a suitable  and congenia! place for meeting with the

children  of tender  age.
16.  I am of the view that the meeting place should
be congenial and conducive to  develop  bond
between the father and children. The Court
premises or the Centaurus Mall, lslamabad are most
definitely not the congenial  places for the said
purpose. Therefore,  the impugned  order  dated
20.05.2019 is set aside whereas the order  dated
06.03.2019  is modified in the following manner:-
l.  that venue of the meeting between minors  and
respondent  No.1 is fixed at the house  of respondent

No.1;

l!.  Since respondent No.1 is stated  to be residing  in
DHA, lslamabad,  whereas according  to petitioner  he
resides  in Satellite Town Rawalpindi,  in either case
the visitatlon  schedule of four hours should take into

W.P. No.282712019

account the transit time.  Accordingly respondent
No.1 would  pick the minors from the residence  of
the peUtioner  one hour before starting  time of
schedule of meeting already  fixed  by the learned
Family Court vide order dated 06.03.2019  and is
bound to return them within one hour after the end

of meeting  time.

!l!.  The bailiff  deputed by the learned Family Court shall
accompany respondent  No.1  while picking up the
minors  and would remain with them till thelr return
to the petitioner.

!V. The parties  would submit their addresses  and
contact  numbers in the Family Court within  ten days

of the receipt  of this order.

17. To dispel the petitioner's  apprehensaon  that
respondent No.1 may not return the minors to her
or otherwise  violate the conditions  of order dated
06.03.2019,  respondent No.1 is directed to submit
surety bond  in the sum of Rs.1 million  withotrc local
surety to the satisfaction  of learned Family  Court
seized of the custody petition.
18. !n view of above the order dated  20.05.2019  is
set aside and order dated 06.03.2019  passed  by
learned Judge Family Court is modified to the extent

of the venue of meeting, in the aforesaid  manner.  As
a natural  corollary the present petition as well as
writ petition No 3198/2019 are disposed of. There
shall be no order  as to costs.
