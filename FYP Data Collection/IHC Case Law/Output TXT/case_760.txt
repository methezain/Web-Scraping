Proceedings 
25.01.2022  Ms. Zareen Kanwal, Advocate.  

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel where 
necessary. 

This  writ  petition  is  against  the  impugned  order  of 

attachment  dated  15.10.2021,  whereby  the  learned  executing 

Court  attached  one  half  of  the  salary  of  the  petitioner.    It 

transpires  from  the  record  that  a  miscellaneous  application  for 

removal  of  the  attachment  was  filed  by  the  petitioner  on 

10.11.2021.  Learned counsel states that the said application is 

not being decided and she is being prejudiced thereby. 

2 

I do not see how this Court sitting in Constitutional 

jurisdiction can interfere with the order of attachment passed by 

the  learned  executing  Court  in  the  absence  of  any  patent 

illegality,  which  has  not  been  shown  to  the  Court.    Learned 

counsel  has  attempted  to  take  me  to  the  merits  of  the 

underlying case, but it is not for  me to look  at them when the 

decree  stood  passed  on  29.06.2019  and  the  order  impugned 

before  me  is  an  order  of  attachment  of  salary  passed  on 

15.10.2021  for  executing  that  decree.    However,  to  the  extent 

that 

the  petitioner 

is  being  prejudiced  by  his  pending 

application dated 10.11.2021 not being decided, this Court can 

and  does  direct  the  learned  executing  Court  to  decide  the  said 

application without much delay, preferably within 30 days.  

3 

With  the  aforesaid  observation,  this  petition  is 

dismissed.
