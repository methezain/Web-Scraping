Father of the petitioner. 
Ahmed Abdul Rafay, Advocate for respondent No.1.   

At  the  very  outset,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.1  pointed  out  that  the  instant 

petition  has  become  infructuous  inasmuch  as 

the  proceedings  out  of  which  the  instant 

petition arose have been finally decided on the 

basis of compromise between the parties.  

2.  

In view of above, the instant petition has 

become  infructuous  and  is  disposed  of  as 

having become infructuous.
