Muhammad Arslan. 

VS

Mst. Madiha Shahzadi and another. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
07.12.2021  Mr.  Armaghan  Saqib  Khan,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  order  dated 

29.09.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

/  Guardian  Court,  West-Islamabad,  whereby 

right  of  the  petitioner  to  cross-examine  PWs 

was closed. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  valuable  rights  of 

the petitioner are involved in the case and it 

is  settled  law  that  the  cases  should  be 

decided on merits rather on technicalities; it 

is  fundamental  right  of  the  petitioner  to 

cross-examine  the  PWs  and  if  the  instant 

petition is not allowed his valuable rights will 

be  jeopardized,  non-appearance  of  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  in  the  Court  on 

21.04.2021  and  29.09.2021  was  not 

deliberate  as  he  was  suffering  from  viral 

infection  that  is  why  he  could  not  appear 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
before  the  Court,  learned  Trial  Court  has 

committed illegality while closing the right of 

cross-examination  of  PWs,  hence  impugned 

order is liable to be set-aside.  

3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice to the respondents.
