 01.03.2022  Malik Talat Hussain Advocate for petitioner 

Mr.M. Akram Shaheen, Advocate for 
respondents 3 & 4. 

  The  instant  writ  petition  is  arising  out  of          

ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  dated  03.05.2019,  and 

judgment  dated  28.10.2021  passed  by  the  Judge  Family 

Court and the Additional District Judge, Islamabad (West) 

respectively,  whereby  suit  of  respondents  3  &  4  for 

dissolution  of  marriage,  maintenance  allowance  and 

dowry articles was decreed ex-parte while appeal was also 

dismissed against ex-parte decree.  

2.   

Relevant 

facts  are 

that  on  22.04.2017, 

respondents 3 and 4 filed suit for dissolution of marriage, 

maintenance  allowance  and  recovery  of  dowry  articles 

against the petitioner, whereof, notices were issued to the 

petitioner who appeared before the Court of First Instance 

on 27.05.2017, by placing power on behalf of his attorney 

and  the  matter  was  adjourned  for  filing  of  written 

statement 

by 

the 

petitioner 

for 

05.07.2017.                    

On  05.07.2017,  neither  the  petitioner  appeared  nor  filed 

written  statement  therefore,  the  court  of  first  instance 

initiated  ex-parte  proceedings  against  him,  the  case  was 

fixed for ex-parte evidence, the petitioner again after lapse 

of  two  months  filed  an  application  for  setting  aside  ex-

parte  proceedings  on  14.09.2017.  The  trial  Court  set 

aside  the  ex-parte  proceedings  on  the  statement  of  the 

petitioner  with  a  cost  of  Rs.  2000/-,  on  05.03.2018,  and 

directed  the  petitioner  to  file  written  statement  on 

28.03.2018, the petitioner again failed to comply with the 

directions  of  the  Court  of  First  Instance  and  was  again 

proceeded ex-parte, case was fixed for the evidence of the 

respondent.  The  defendant  than  filed  an  application  for

setting aside the ex-parte orders on the same day, which 

was  allowed  vide  orders  dated  07.05.2018,  with  cost  of 

Rs.  1000/-,  the  defendant  again  failed  to  appear  on 

02.10.2018,  and  was  proceeded  ex-parte.  The  Court  of 

First Instance recorded ex-parte evidence on 05.11.2018. 

The  petitioner  again  filed  an  application  on  29.05.2018, 

but  once  again  he  failed  to  appear  on  11.02.2019,  the 

Court  of  First  Instance  after  hearing  ex-parte  evidence 

decreed  the  suit  on  03.05.2019.  It  was  also  observed  by 

the  First  Appellate  Court  that  sufficient  opportunities 

were  provided  to  the  appellant  to  argue  the  appeal  but 

due  to  the  non-serious  attitude  of  the  petitioner  the 

matter was decided on the available record.  

3.   

The  suit  was  partially  decreed  in  terms  that 

marriage inter-se the parties stood dissolved on the basis 

of 

‘Khula’  subject 

to  return  of  Rs.  5000/-  and 

relinquishment  of  deferred  dower,  recovery  of  dowry 

article  as  per  list  Exh.  P/5  or  in  alternate  Rs.  150000/-, 

respondent  No.  3  (Mst.  Sarwat  Zahra)  held  entitled  to 

recover  maintenance  at  the  rate  of  15,000/-  per  month 

from  May  2015  till  expiry  of  ‘Iddat’  period,  while 

respondent  No.4  held  entitled  to  the  maintenance  at  the 

same  rate  per  month  from  November  2016  till  her  legal 

entitlement with 10% annual increase.  

4.   

Against the judgment and decree ibid, petitioner 

filed appeal in terms of section 14(1) of the Family Court 

Act, 1964 which was dismissed by the Additional District 

Judge, 

Islamabad 

(West), 

vide 

judgment  dated 

28.10.2021, hence instant writ petition.  

5.   

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argued  that 

law favours adjudication of the matters on merits instead 

of  technical  knockout;  that  non-appearance  of  the 

petitioner  before  the  Court  of  first  instance  was  neither 

deliberate nor intentional; that the respondent No. 3 is a 

disgruntled  wife,  cannot  be  held  entitled 

to  any 

maintenance  while  the  awarded  amount  also  does  not 

commensurate  with  the 

financial  capability  of  the 

petitioner  who  should  be  given  a  chance  to  adduce  his 

case, and to counter the claim of the respondents 3 & 4. 

W.P. No.114 of 2022

Learned  counsel  placed  reliance  upon  case  law  reported 

as 1988 SCMR 747. 

5.   

On 

the  other  hand, 

learned  counsel 

for 

respondents 3 & 4 watching brief, waives notice on behalf 

of  said  respondents  and  with  permission  argued  that 

petitioner  intends  to  frustrate  the  entire  proceedings, 

which  had  taken  several  years  to  reach 

its 

final 

conclusion in a nuptial dispute which, otherwise, is to be 

decided within short span of time.  

6.   

According to the learned counsel, the conduct of 

the  petitioner  highlighted  by  the  two  learned  courts,  ex-

facie,  would  be  sufficient  to  gauge  his  ill  intention, 

whereby he, once again attempted to evade responsibility 

under the decree.  

Heard record examined.  

7.   

The  scan  of  record  reveals  that  family  suit  filed 

in  April,  2017,  reached  to  its  conclusion  at  the  first  tier 

within  a  period  about  two  years  on  03.05.2017,  which, 

under  the  law  had  to  be  decided  within  a  period  of  four 

months  as  contemplated  in  section  12(a)  of  the  Family 

Court Act, 1964. 

8.   

In  addition,  the  conduct  demonstrated  by  the 

petitioner 

throughout 

the  proceedings,  has  been 

highlighted by the learned trial Court in paragraph No. 2, 

3  &  4.  For  instance,  at  the  preliminary  stage,  he  was 

proceeded 

ex-parte 

on  05.07.2017,  which  was 

subsequently  set  aside,  again  burdened  with  same 

penalty on 28.03.2018, which was subsequently set aside 

on  the  application  of  the  petitioner.  After  pre-trial 

reconciliation  proceedings  he  again  disjoined 

the 

proceedings  and  was  proceeded  ex-parte  on  02.04.2018 

and to counter the said mischief, again adopted the same 

course  and  joined  the  proceedings,  vide  order  dated 

29.11.2019.  The  petitioner  instead  to  mend  his  ways, 

followed  the  same  course  and  ultimately  proceeded  ex-

parte  on  11.02.2019.  It  is  thus  obvious  that,  since  the 

filing  of  the  suit,  petitioner  was  proceeded  against  ex-

 
 
W.P. No.114 of 2022 

4 

parte for four consecutive times, two at pre-trial stage and 

rest thereafter.  

9.   

The  learned  Appellate  Court  had  also  given  due 

consideration to the attending circumstances of the case. 

It is significant to note that even during the hearing of the 

appeal 

the  petitioner  despite  availing 

sufficient 

opportunities  failed  to  argue  the  appeal,  and  even  to  put 

up  his  appearance  which  compelled  the  court  to  decide 

the  appeal,  on  the  basis  of  material  available  on  record. 

The  appeal  was  filed  on  30.08.2021  and  was  decided  on 

28.10.2021.  The  instant  writ  petitioner  was  preferred 

after about two months of the judgment in appeal. 

10. 

The  petitioner  is  asking  for  relief  in  terms  of 

article  199  of  the  constitution  against  the  concurrent 

observations,  which  if  put  in  juxtaposition  with  the 

conduct  of  the  petitioner,  appears  to  be  just,  proper  and 

in accordance with material available on record and there 

exists no justification to upset the same in absence of any 

illegality  or  material  irregularity.  Consequently  instant 

writ petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.
