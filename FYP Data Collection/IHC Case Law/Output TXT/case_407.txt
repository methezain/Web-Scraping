Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel where necessary.  

29.06.2022  Nemo. 

On  the  preceding  date  i.e.  06.01.2022,  office  was 

directed  to  issue  notice  pervi  to  the  petitioner  and  his 

counsel.  

Despite 

service  of  notice, 

there 

is  no 

representation on behalf of the petitioner. It seems that 

the petitioner has lost interest in the matter.  

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ  petition 

is 

dismissed for non-prosecution.
