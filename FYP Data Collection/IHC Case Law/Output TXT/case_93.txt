petitioner 
respondents  No.1  and  2  in  Writ  Petition 
No.2854 of 2019. 
Mian  Asad  Ahmed,  Advocate  alongwith

Learned  counsel  for  respondent 

No.1  /  Qazi  Umer  Khatab,  in  the  instant 

petition  and  petitioner 

in  Writ  Petition 

No.2854  of  2019,  has  argued  that  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  has  awarded 

monthly  maintenance  at 

the 

rate  of 

Rs.5,000/-  to  the  petitioner  /  Mst.  Naveed 

Musarat,  who  is  wife  of  respondent  No.1, 

which  was  upheld  by  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge-V,  East-Islamabad  vide  order 

dated  09.05.2019.  Learned  counsel  further 

submits  that  in  light  of  the  Rule  277  of 

Principles of Muhammadan Law and law laid 

down  in  cases  reported  as  “Mst. Parveen 

Khan v. Abdul Ghafoor and 2 others.” (2016 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
CLC  932),  “Mst. Ishrat Bibi v. Muhammad 

Arshad and another.” (2013 MLD 537), the 

petitioner 

is  not  entitled 

for  grant  of 

maintenance  as  she  left  the  house  without 

consent  of  respondent  No.1  and  she  is 

disobedient  wife, 

respondent  No.1  has 

accepted  all  the  demands  raised  by  the 

petitioner 

by 

providing 

a 

separate 

accommodation  and  for  giving  a  proper 

education  to  the  minors  and  maintenance, 

etc.  to  the  petitioner  but  she  has  refused  to 

live with respondent No.1 and demanded the 

purchase  of  the  house  and  property  in  her 

name,  which  demand 

is 

illegal  and 

unjustified,  hence  the  impugned  orders  are 

erroneous and are liable to be set-aside. 

 2. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent 

No.1  is  directed  to  assist  the  Court  and 

provide  case  laws  on  the  points  raised  by 

him  that  the  concurrent  findings  of  both  the 

learned lower courts have been set-aside by 

the High Court in writ of certiorari, in similar 

circumstances. 

 3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

is  also  directed  to  provide  case  law  on  the 

proposition in the matter.  

4. 

Re-list after two weeks.
