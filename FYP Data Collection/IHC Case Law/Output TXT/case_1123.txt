working  as  Assistant  Professor 

in  Quaid-e-Azam 

University  and  had  married  Khurram  Mehboob  Shah 

(petitioner No.1) on 14.09.2016, who were later on blessed 

with a son,  Rohan; that  when respondent No.2  was going 

out of the country on a course, her husband was unable to 

get  visa,  which  resulted  into  family  dispute  and  on 

03.06.2018,  the  petitioners  snatched  the  minor  from  her 

with  the  help  of  Kamran  Iqbal  Yousafi,  MD  KPMG, 

Lahore;  that  the  said  criminal  case  has  been  tried  by  the 

learned Trial Court and resultantly all the petitioners have 

been  acquitted  of  the  charge  vide 

judgment  dated 

19.09.2020,  whereafter  the  petitioners  filed  application 

under  Section  193  PPC  praying  to  proceed  against 

respondent  No.2  for  willfully  committing  perjury  by 

fabricating evidence in the criminal case on 03.10.2020, and 

the learned Trial Court without adverting to the evidence 

of  perjury  dismissed  the  said  application  vide  impugned 

order dated 17.10.2020; petitioner No.2 further argued that 

the  evidence  of  perjury    is  visible  on  record  as  the 

prosecution  has  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  nor  is 

respondent  No.2  able  to  demonstrate  from  record  that  all 

petitioners  are  involved  in  kidnapping  of  her  minor  son, 

who  is  otherwise  real  son  of  petitioner  No.1  Khurram 

Mehboob Shah, as such, no  offence is  committed in terms 

of  Section  363  PPC,  therefore,  learned  Trial  Court  has  to 

prosecute  respondent  No.2  for  malicious  prosecution  in 

terms of Section 193 PPC. 

3.  Arguments heard, record perused.

4.  Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  respondent  No.2  was 

married to petitioner No.1 and blessed with minor son but, 

later  on  due  to  acute  disparity  respondent  No.1,  father  of 

minor, had allegedly snatched the minor from respondent 

No.2 (mother), whereafter the latter approached this Court 

through  Criminal  Miscellaneous  No.475/2018  but, 

petitioner  No.1  moved  from  residential  abode  along  with 

minor  and  shifted  to  Karachi,  which  resulted  into  non 

recovery  of  minor  and  disposal  of 

the  criminal 

miscellaneous  petition  filed  by  respondent  No.2  with  the 

observation  that  petitioner  i.e.  present  respondent  No.2 

shall approach the police, vide order dated 20.06.2018. The 

matter  has  been  agitated  before  the  apex  Court  by 

Respondent  No.2  through  Criminal  Petition  No.276/2018, 

whereby  on  the  direction  of  apex  Court  the  minor  was 

recovered and handed over to Respondent No.2 vide order 

dated  14.09.2018.  However, on the other hand respondent 

No.2  got  lodged  the  instant  FIR  No.166,  dated  10.08.2018, 

under  Sections  363,  147,  148  PPC,  P.S.  Secretariat, 

Islamabad  for  alleged  abduction  of  minor  at  the  hands  of 

petitioners. 

5.  The  petitioners  have  been  tried  by  the  Court  after 

framing the charge and finally all the petitioners have been 

acquitted  of  the  criminal  case  on  the  basis  of  judgments 

reported  as  PLD  1968  Lahore  97  (Ahmad  Nawaz,  etc.  VS 

The State), PLD 2008 Lahore 533 (Kausar Parveen VS The 

State)  and  2001  P.Cr.LJ  31  Lahore  (Muhammad  Ashraf  v. 

S.H.O.),  whereby  the  offence  under  Section  361  PPC  has 

been elaborated, as such, the learned Trial Court has taken 

 
 
W.P. No.2751/2021 

 Page-4 

the view that the father, if removes the minor from mother, 

is  not  guilty  of  offence  of  kidnapping,  which  is  the  main 

reason of acquittal. 

6.  Besides  the  above  referred  position,  the  petitioners 

had  filed  an  application  under  Section  193  PPC  against 

respondent No.2, per se, the said Section is  defined in the 

following manner:  

Section 193 PPC (Punishment for false evidence) 

Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a 

judicial  proceeding,  or  fabricates  false  evidence  for  the 

purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, 

shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description 

for a term, which may extend to seven years, and shall also 

be  liable  to  fine;  and  whoever,  intentionally  gives  or 

fabricates  false  evidence  in  any  other  case,  shall,  be 

punished  with  imprisonment  of  either  description"  for  a 

term  which  may  extend  to  three  years,  and  shall  also  be 

liable to fine. 

7.  The  application  so  filed  by  the  petitioners  under 

Section  193  PPC  qua  false  evidence  in  the 

judicial 

proceedings  requires  a  logical  explanation.  If  the  learned 

Trial Court in the instant criminal case comes to conclusion 

that  Respondent  No.2  (complainant)  is  not  a  truthful 

person and facts narrated by her are found false, thereafter 

the  offence  under  Section  193  PPC  attracts  and  even  the 

learned Trial Court can proceed with trial of a person who 

is  found  guilty  of  perjury  in  the  light  of  case  reported  as 

PLD 2019 SC 527 (Notice to Constable Khizar Hayat in the 

matter of Criminal Miscellaneous No.200/2019). But in this 

case, the learned Trial Court has not declared Respondent 

No.2  guilty  of  giving  false  evidence  or  offence  of  perjury 

 
 
 
W.P. No.2751/2021 

 Page-5 

nor  any  such  finding  is  visible  from  record,  rather  the 

learned  trial  Court  while  acquitting  the  petitioners,  vide 

order dated 19.09.2020, has observed as under:  

“20. 

In  view  of  above  discussion,  it  is  held  that  the 

prosecution  has  miserably  failed  to  produce  cogent,  solid 

trustworthy  and  confidence  inspiring  evidence,  to  connect 

the accused persons with commission of offences. Moreover, 

no  offence  of  kidnapping  constitute  against  accused 

Khurram  Mehboob,  being  father  of  minor.  I  hereby  acquit 

accused persons, Khurram Mehboob s/o Mehboob Hussain, 

Mehboob  Hussain  S/O  Raheem  Baksh,  Rehana  Bibi  W/O 

Mehboob  Hussain  and  Riffat  Bibi  W/O  Adnan  Naeem, 

from  the  charge  of  offences  U/S  363/149/147/109  PPC. 

Accused are on bail. Their bail bonds stand discharged from 

their liabilities. Case property, if any, be dealt in accordance 

with law. File be consigned to the record room after its due 

completion.” 

8.  After  meticulous  perusal  of  above  referred  order,  it 

can  safely  been  concluded  that  the  application  under 

Section  193  PPC  of  the  petitioners  has  rightly  been 

dismissed  while  taking  analogy  from  provision  of  Section 

195(1)(b) Cr.P.C., which reads as under:  

195. (1) No Court shall take cognizance: -- 

(b)  Prosecution  for  certain  offences  against  public 

justice:  Of  any  offence  punishable  under  arty  of  the 

following sections of  the same  Code, namely Sections 193, 

194, 195, 196, 199, 200, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211 

and  228,  when  such  offence  is  alleged  to  have  been 

committed  in,  or  in  relation  to,  any  proceeding  in  any 

Court, except, on the complaint in writing of such Court or 

of some other Court to which such Court is subordinate. 

9. 

In addition to the above referred position, the learned 

Trial Court while relying upon PLD 1971 SC 124 (Mansab 

Ali v. Amir), 1986 MLD 1156 Lahore (Muhammad Ramzan 

 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2751/2021 

 Page-6 

VS The State) and 2003 P.Cr.LJ 1242 Karachi (Abdul Nabi 

v.  Syed  Mukhtar)  has  rightly  opined  that  no  cognizance 

could  be  taken  by  a  Court,  except  on  a  complaint  in 

writing by such Court where such offence is committed, as 

such, the private person has no right to file a complaint in 

view  of  provision  under  Section  195(1)(b)  Cr.P.C.  This 

Court  is  in  agreement  with  the  view  arrived  at  by  the 

learned Trial Court vide impugned order dated 17.10.2020 

that the acquittal of present petitioners from criminal case 

is  not  on  the  basis  of  malicious  prosecution,  rather  on  a 

technical  reason  that  petitioner  No.1  being  father  of  the 

minor  is  not  held  liable  for  offence  of  kidnapping  of  his 

own  son,  hence  the  question  of  fabricating  false  evidence 

on  the  part  of  respondent  No.2  is  not  visible  ,  especially 

when  the  entire  matter  of  removal  of  minor  has  been 

settled  by 

the  apex  Court 

in  Criminal  Petition 

No.672/2018, 

therefore, 

the 

instant  writ  petition 

is 

misconceived and same is hereby DISMISSED in limine.
