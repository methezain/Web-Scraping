12. 

In this regard, reliance is placed upon 

the following reported case laws: 

i. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Saeed 

Ahmad VS The State and others” 

(2011 SCMR 1686),  it  has  been 

held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 

of Pakistan that: 

“It  is  settled  law  that  a 

confession  made  by  an 

accused  person  before  the 

police  in  its  custody  is 

inadmissible  in  evidence”. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Criminal Appeal No. 104 of 2021 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  a  case 

titled  as  “Muhammad  Ismail 

and  others  VS  The  State” 

(2017 SCMR 898). 

ii. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Sajjan 

Solangi  VS  The  State”  (2019 

SCMR 872), it has been held by the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 

that: 

“Disclosure under the custody 

before 

the  police 

is 

inadmissible”.  

iii. 

In  a  case 

titled  as  “Gul 

Muhammad and another VS The 

State 

through  Prosecutor 

General Balochistan (2021 SCMR 

381),  it  has  been  held  by  the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 

that: 

“Practice of recording extra 

judicial  confession  by  the 

police officials in presence of 

police officers was nullity in 

the  eye  of  law  and  no 

credence could be extended 

to such piece of evidence”. 

13.  As 

far 

as 

joint 

recovery  of             

Rs.  30,000/-  from  the  five  respondents  / 

 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Criminal Appeal No. 104 of 2021 

accused 

and 

non 

conducting 

of 

Identification  Parade  is  concerned,  it  has 

been held in the following reported cases: 

i. 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

“Muhammad  Mushtaq  VS 

Mustansar Hussain and others” 

(2016 SCMR 2123),  it  has  been 

held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 

of Pakistan that: 

“The alleged recovery of the 

dead body was admittedly a 

joint  recovery  which  is 

inadmissible in evidence”.  

ii. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Shabbir 

Ahmed VS The State” (2011 SCMR 

1142), it has been held by the Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan that:  

“After  perusal  of  the 

impugned judgment and the 

evidence of the prosecution, 

we find that in this case no 

regular  test  identification 

parade was held. The alleged 

recovery  of motorcycle was 

made on the joint pointation 

of  the  two  accused” 

(Emphasis  added).  It  has 

further been mentioned that: 

“In  view  of  the  evidence 

which is no manner connect 

 
 
8 

Criminal Appeal No. 104 of 2021 

the present petitioner as well 

as his co-accused Bismillah, 

we find that this is a case of 

no  evidence”, 

and 

the 

conviction 

awarded 

to 

the 

accused was set aside. 

iii. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Ghulam 

Akbar and another VS The State” 

(2008 SCMR 1064),  it  has  been  held 

by 

the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan that: 

“Recovery 

of 

stolen 

motorcycle 

on 

joint 

pointation  of  two  accused 

from  Sugar  Cane  field  was 

inadmissible in evidence”. 

iv.  In  a  case  titled  as  “Sajjad 

Bhatti and others VS The State” 

(2017 PCr.L.J 114),  it  has  been 

held that : 

“Joint 

recoveries  were 

effected  at  the  instance  of 

accused 

were 

inconsequential”. 

v. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Raheel 

Anwar  and  another  VS  The 

State  and  others”  (2019  YLR 

1385), it has been held that: 

“The law is settled by know 

that  joint  recovery  is  not 

admissible in evidence”.  

 
 
 
9 

Criminal Appeal No. 104 of 2021 

14.  The scope of setting aside the benefit 

of  acquittal  from  the  Court  of  competent 

jurisdiction  is  very  much  limited.  Reliance 

in  this  regard  is  placed on  a  case  titled  as 

“The State through P.G. Sindh and 

others VS Ahmed Omer Sheikh and 

others” (2021 SCMR 873),  wherein  it 

has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court of Pakistan that: 

“Admittedly the parameters to deal 

with the appeal against conviction 

and  appeal  against  acquittal  are 

totally  different  because  the 

acquittal 

carries 

double 

presumption  of  innocence  and 

same could be reversed only when 

found  blatantly  perverse,  illegal, 

arbitrary, capricious or speculative, 

shocking  or 

rests  upon 

impossibility.  If  there  is  a 

possibility of a contrary view even 

then  acquittal  could  not  be  set 

aside.” 

It  has  also  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled 

as  “Zeeshan alias Shani and another 

VS  Muhammad  Ayub  and  others” 

(2021 SCMR 142) that: 

“It  is  by  now  well  settled  that 

 
 
 
10 

Criminal Appeal No. 104 of 2021 

reversal  of  acquittal  requires 

strong  grounds  and  cannot  be 

interfered  with  merely  on  the 

possibility of contra view”. 

15.  As  neither  any  incriminating,  legal 

and  cogent  evidence  was  collected  by  the 

police  against 

the 

respondents  nor 

produced 

in 

the 

trial  Court  by 

the 

prosecution,  hence  the  respondents  were 

rightly  acquitted  by  the  learned  trial  Court 

vide 

impugned 

judgment 

dated 

04.06.2021. 

16. 

In  view  of  forgoing  observation  / 

discussion,  instant  criminal  appeal  against 

acquittal  of  respondents  under  Section 

417(2)  Cr.P.C 

stands  dismissed 

in 

limine.
