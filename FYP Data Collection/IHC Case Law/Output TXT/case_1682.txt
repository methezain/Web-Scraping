C.R. No.127/2019. 

Federation  of Pakistan  through  Secretary,  Ministry  of Housing  & 
Works,  Islamabad  etc. 

VS 

Mst.  Tasleem  Bibi etc. 

Petitioner by: 

Barrister Mumtaz Ali, AAG. 
Muhammad Mohsin Pasha, Joint 
Estate Officer. 

Respondent No. I  by: 

Mr.  Bahar Saeed Butt, Advocate. 

Date  of Decision: 

21.02.2020. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  l(AYANI,  J:-  Through  this  civil  revision  petition, 

Federation  of Pakistan  has  assailed the  order dated  27.10.20I8,  passed  by  learned 

Civil Judge  I st Class (West) Islamabad, whereby suit filed by respondent No. I  was 

disposed of in favour of respondent. The petitioner has also assailed the order dated 

20.12.20I8,  passed  by  learned  District  Judge  (West),  Islamabad,  whereby  appeal 

filed by the petitioner against the order dated 27.10.20I8  was dismissed. 

2. 

Learned  AAG  contends  that  suit quarter No.35/6-D  (New 77/6-D),  St.32, 

F-6/I,  Islamabad  was  allotted  to  Irfan  ud  Din  Qureshi,  who  was  civil  servant  in 

BPS-I6  in Collectorate  of Customs  vide  allotment  letter dated  I4.10.2005  and he 

died during  service  at  Karachi  on  I 8.06.2013  as per notification  dated  08.02.2013 

issued  by  Federal  Board  of  Revenue,  Government  of  Pakistan  and  his 

mother/respondent  No. I  Mst.  Tasleem  Bibi  filed  suit  for  declaration,  mandatory 

and permanent injunction seeking the relief that she is entitled to retain the allotted 

accommodation  till  age  of superannuation  of her  son  i.e.  20. I 2.2030  under  Prime 

Minister Assistance Package  for the families of the employees,  who die in service; 

that Estate Office filed written  statement and took  categorical  stance that  deceased 

son  of  respondent  No.I  died  on  I8.06.2013  and  the  retention  of  government 

accommodation  under  Rule  I 5(A)  of Accommodation  Allocation  Rules,  2002  is 

C.R No.127/2019.

initially  for  one  year  and  under  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package 

dated 

13.06.2006 she was allowed to retain accommodation for maximum five years up to 

I 7 .06.20 I 8  as such the  accommodation cannot be retained beyond the  said period; 

that  stance  taken  by  the  Estate  Office  before  learned  Trial  Court  has  not  been 

appreciated  and  learned  Trial  Court  decided  the  matter  without  framing  of issues 

and recording  of evidence  vide  impugned order dated 27.10.20I8  and even  appeal 

filed  by  the  petitioner  before  learned  District  Judge  was  dismissed  being  time 

barred without appreciating legal question. 

3. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for respondent  No.I  contends  that  respondent 

No. I  was  entitled  to  retain  government  accommodation  initially  under  Prime 

Minister Assistance  Package  for  five years but  later on Prime  Minister  Assistance 

Package was amended on 20.10.20I4  with retrospective effect i.e.  I5.06.2013 in the 

existing  assistance  package  for  the  families  of government  servants,  who  die  in 

service,  whereby 

the  families  of  deceased  civil  servants  can  retain 

the 

accommodation till the age of superannuation or for five years, whichever is earlier 

and as such the Courts below have rightly appreciated this aspect in proper manner; 

that appeal filed by the petitioner before learned District Judge Islamabad was time 

barred and the same was rightly dismissed. 

4. 

5. 

I have heard the arguments and perused the record. 

Perusal  of record  reveals  that  suit  accommodation  i.e.  House  No.35/6-D 

(New 77/6-D),  St.32,  F-6/I,  Islamabad was  allotted to  Irfan ud  Din  Qureshi,  who 

was  civil  servant  BPS-16  in  Collectorate  of Customs  vide  allotment  letter  dated 

I4.10.2005.  The allottee died during service on  I8.06.2013  as per notification dated 

08.02.2013  issued by  Federal  Board  of Revenue,  Government  of Pakistan,  where  

after  the  suit  accommodation  has  been  retained  by  her  mother/respondent  No. I 

being  dependent  alongwith  widow  under  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package  for 

five years dated  13.06.2006, however, the Estate Office as well as Mio  Housing & 

Works  took  stance  that  suit  accommodation  can  only  be  retained  till  I 7.06.20I8 

under Accommodation Allocation Rules, 2002 read with Prime Minister Assistance 

Package  and  as  such  the  retention  of  government  accommodation  till  age  of 

C.R No.127/2019.

superannuation  is  available  to  respondent  No. I  as  widow  is  not  living  with 

respondent  No. I  mother  of  the  deceased  civil  servant.  When  confronted  learned 

AAG  alongwith  Joint  Estate  Officer,  contend that  no  evidence  has  been  recorded 

qua the said factual dispute. 

6. 

Perusal  of  record  further  reveals  that  Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package 

2006 has further been  amended  by Prime Minister Assistance Package  20.10.2014 

issued by  Establishment  Division,  whereby  the  family  members  of deceased  civil 

servant  can  retain  the  government  accommodation  "till  superannuation  or five 

years  whichever  is earlier"  and the  said new package is effective from  15.06.2013 

and as such the  case of deceased civil servant Irfan ud Din Qureshi falls under the 

said date and both the Courts below have rightly appreciated this fact concurrently, 

however, the  Estate  Office took  specific  stance that  the  widow  and  mother  of the 

deceased  are  living  separately  but  this  aspect  has  not  been  discussed  in  the 

impugned orders of Courts below nor such factual aspect has been justified  through 

any evidence. 

7. 

I  have  attended  the  findings  of  learned  Trial  Court  in  the  concluding 

paragraph, which is reproduced as under:- 

"Keeping in view of the above plaintiff  is entitled to retain 
the  possession  of  suit  accommodation  till  the  age  of 
superannuation  of  deceased  i.e.  20-12-2030  and  after 
completion  of retention period  she  is directed  to  handover 
the 
peaceful  possession  of  suit  accommodation 
defendants. Instant suit is disposed off. File be consigned to 
record room after due completion and compilation. " 

to 

8. 

In  above  referred  order  learned  Trial  Court  held  that  respondent  No.I  is 

entitled  to  retain  suit  accommodation  on  the  basis  of  Prime  Minister  Assistance 

Package 2014 till the age of superannuation of the deceased i.e. 20.12.2030 and the 

suit has  been  disposed  of. The manner, in which  said order was passed  is contrary 

to the principles  referred  in Order XX  Rule  1,  5,  6,  7  CPC as no decree  sheet has 

been prepared,  which  is requirement  of law to  be  followed  and the  suit  cannot be 

disposed of rather  a decree should be passed, however, the question which requires 

consideration is as to whether Trial Court requires adjudication of a matter by way 

of recording  of evidence  or otherwise, the  same has to  be  determined  by the  Trial 

C.R No.127 /2019.

Court but  all  these  aspects  are  silent  although the  findings  given  by  learned  Trial 

Court to  the  extent  of application  of Prime  Minister  Assistance  Package  2014  are 

reflected from the record, which are in accordance with law, therefore, at this stage 

the irregularity committed  by learned Trial Court cannot be rectified  by this  Court 

in terms of section  115  CPC to pass decree in favour of respondent. 

9. 

In view of above discussion, the instant civil revision petition is allowed, the 

impugned  order  and  judgment  of  Courts  below  are  set  aside  and  the  matter  is 

remanded  to  learned Trial  Court with direction to  decide the  question  afresh after 

hearing  learned  counsel  for  the parties  keeping  in  view  the  observations  recorded 

above within period of two months.
