Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Mr.  Haroon-ur-Rashid,  Advocate 
petitioner. 

for 

the 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contends that as the matter pertains to the year 

2015,  so  he  has  not  been  able  to  establish 

contact  with  his  client.  Apparently,  it  seems 

that the matter has been compromised and the 

grievance  of  the  petitioner  would  have  been 

redressed  and 

the  petition  has  become 

infructuous.  Learned  counsel  further  contends 

that  if  the  fresh  cause  of  action  arose,  the 

petitioner be allowed to file fresh petition. 

2. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant 

petition 

is  dismissed  as  having  become 

infructuous,  however,  if  any  fresh  cause  of 

action  accrued,  the  petitioner  may  file  a  fresh 

petition.
