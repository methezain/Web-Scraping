6. 

The petitioner f  husband  has now approached  this

Court on the ground that the registered Nikah Nama  dated

06.05.2005  (Exh.P3)  was executed between  the parties and in

column  3, dower  amount  has been  mentioned  as Rs.50,000/-

while affidavit  dated  17.06.2006 has got no evidentiary value

because  it was neither  executed  by the present  petitioner nor

it was proved through  evidence  before  the trial court-  It is

further submitted that the affidavit  does not contain  his

signatures in original,  there  are no marginal witness  and it

has not been  sworn before Oath Commissioner  and even

otherwise  the affidavit cannot  be considered  as undertaking

or agreement.

7.  The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 /

plaintiff  opposed the petition on the ground that the

petitioner  had himself executed the affidavit and never

rebutted its contents before the learned trial court'

8.  On the other hand, the findings  given by the learned

Judge Family Court on the suit of conjugal  rights have

attained finality  regarding enhanced dower amount of

Rs.5,00,000/-.  It is further  submitted that the present writ

petition is not maintainable  as it involves  disputed  questions

of facts and evidence  cannot be discussed  at this stage.

9.  Both the parties relied  uPon case law reported  as

Ameer  Ali Khan VS Kishwar Bashir (PLD 2004 S.C 746),

wherein  it was held that the enhanced dower amount on the

basis of an agreement after the Nikah  can be claimed

through family suit and not tfuough civil suit.

10.  The respondent also  relied  upon  a reported judgment

of Hon'ble Lahore High Court titled as Major  (Retd)  Ishtiaq

Mehmood  VS Mst. Zareen Gul (2002 CLC 1838), wherein it

was held that the wife  can refuse to live with husband,  if her

husband, on demand,  does not pay the dower amount and

that the distinction  between Khula and Mubaraat is that in

the former  the wife desires  a separation  by giving  some

consideration for her release, while in Mubaraat  both  the

parties  agree and wife is entitled  for half of the benefits.

11.  Heard and record perused.

12.  Admitted position is that Nikah was performed  on

06.05.2005 and according  to column 13 of registered  Nikha

Nama (Exh.P3),  dower was fixed as Rs.50,000/-while

affidavit  (Exh.P4)  is said to be executed  on17.06.2006.

13.  A bare perusal  of affidavit shows that it was neither

sworn on oath nor it was solemnly affirmed  before  any Oath

Commissioner.  An affidavit  cannot be equated with an

agreement or undertaking, because affidavits  are not

registered documents  and since there are no marginal

witnesses,  it cannot  be proved. After its denial by the

petitioner / defendant,  onus had shifted on plaintiff to prove

it, but she never produced  any witness on this point nor

requested for its reference  to a hand  writing expert. There  is

no dispute  on the point that there is neither any agreement

nor undertaking on record and, therefore, the learned Addl.

District |udge  erred in holding  that on the basis of affidavit

5

\t

(Exh.P4)  Dated  L7.06.2006 the respondent  is entitled  to

recover the enhanced dower amount of Rs.5,00,000 / -.

1.4. As far as the claim of maintenance allowance  is

concerned,  it has been accepted  by both the parties at the

rate of one tola per month or its price for the period of eight

month  i.e February  to October  2008, therefore,  no findings

on this point  are required.

15.  For the foregoing  reasons,  the petition is accepted,

judgment dated 14.L0.2010  passed  by learned Addl.  District

Judge  Islamabad is set-aside to the extent of recovery  of

enhanced dower  amount  of Rs.5,00,000 / -.  Parties are left to

bear their own costs
