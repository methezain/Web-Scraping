Ms. Saira Khalid Rajput, Advocate.

======================================= 

BABAR  SATTAR,  J.-  The  petitioner  has  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated  30.09.2019  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge Family Court (East), Islamabad, and the judgment passed 

by the learned Additional District Judge (East), Islamabad, dated 

27.11.2019,  pursuant  to  which  the  judgment  and  decree  of  the 

learned Family Court has been upheld. 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that 

the  list  of  dowry  articles  was  prepared  subsequently  and  ought 

not  have  been  relied  upon  by  the  learned  Family  Court  and  the 

learned  appellate  Court.  She  further  contended  that  in  deciding 

issue  No.4  the  learned  Family  Court  as  well  as  the  learned 

appellate Court have miscalculated the amount of gold that had 

been  gifted  to  respondent  No.3,  which  was  a  consequence  of 

misreading of evidence. 

3. 

The 

learned  counsel 

for  respondents  No.3  &  4 

contended  that  the  challenge  in  the  petition  to  the  impugned 

judgment is only to the extent of gold ornaments and not to the 

extent  of  dowry  articles  as  it  is  evident  from  the  prayer  in  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                         -2-                   Writ Petition No.92 of 2020 

petition.  She  submitted  that  respondent  No.3  in  her  pleadings 

very  clearly  stated  the  gold  items  that  she  had  claimed.  The 

same  contention  was  stated  in  her  affidavit  presented  for 

purposes  of  examination-in-chief  and  such  testimony  remained 

unshaken  during  cross-examination, 

in  which  she  clearly 

asserted that a neckless which had been given to her as a gift by 

the  petitioner  had  been  snatched  from  her  subsequently.  She 

contended that the learned Family Court discussed the evidence 

and  then  rendered  the  finding  in  relation  to  issue  No.4,  which 

was  based  on  the  assertion  made  by  respondent  No.1  that 

remained  unshaken  and  un-rebutted.  The  learned  Family  Court 

thus  granted  relief  in  relation  to  issue  No.4.  She  further 

submitted that the learned appellate Court also correctly decided 

issue  No.4  by  noting  that  respondent  No.3  had  very  clearly 

provided details of the gold ornaments that she was claiming and 

in  the  response  filed  by  the  petitioner  against  para-2  of  the 

plaint,  the  denial  was  evasive.  And  that  the  learned  appellate 

Court correctly appreciated the law that where a party evasively 

denies  a  factual  assertion  such  denial  is  deemed  to  be  an 

admission.  In  view  of  the  same,  the  learned  counsel  for 

respondents  No.3  &  4  submitted  that  there  was  no  infirmity  in 

the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  rendered  by  the  learned 

Family Court as well as by the learned appellate Court.   

4. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  failed  to 

convince this Court that there was any evidence that was either 

misread or not read by the learned Family Court and the learned 

appellate Court. She has also failed to point out any illegality or 

infirmity in the reasoning of the learned Family Court as well as 

 
 
 
 
  
                                         -3-                   Writ Petition No.92 of 2020 

the  learned  appellate  Court.  The  learned  Family  Court  in  a 

detailed reasoned order seems to have appreciated the evidence 

and accepted the contention of respondent No.3 that a neckless 

was  indeed  given  to  her  as  gift  by  the  petitioner,  which  was 

subsequently  snatched  away  from  her.  The  learned  appellate 

Court  also  seems  to  have  appreciated  the  evidence  as  well  as 

applied  settled  law  in  relation  to  evasive  denial  correctly.  The 

contention  of  the  petitioner  in  relation  to  decision  in  issue  No.1 

cannot  be  adjudicated  by  this  Court  as  in  the  memo  of  the 

instant  petition  the  challenge  by  the  petitioner  has  been  limited 

to the extent of the decision on issue No.4. 

5. 

In view of the above, this petition  is without merit and 

is  dismissed  with  a  cost  in  the  amount  of  Rs.25,000/-  to  be 

paid by the petitioner to respondents No.3 & 4 within a period of 

thirty  days.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  will  file  a 

certificate  with  the  Deputy  Registrar  (Judicial),  of  this  Court, 

certifying that the order as to cost has been complied with within 

such period
