Through  instant  writ  petition,  petitioner 

impugns judgment and decree dated 21.09.2019 

&  20.01.2020,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court  and  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge,  Islamabad-West,  respectively  whereby 

the  two  suits  one  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance,  gold  ornaments  and  the  other  for 

dowry  articles,  filed  by  respondent  No.3  were 

partially  decreed  while  appeal  filed  by  the 

petitioner was dismissed being time barred.   

2.   

The decree passed and affirmed was to 

the following effect:- 

“Respondent  No.3  was  held  entitled  to 
recovery  of  maintenance  allowance  for 
herself from March 2015 till February 2019 
@ Rs.2000/- per month, recovery of nine 
tola gold ornaments or as alternate its 
market value and  remaining dowry articles 
including six  dresses, a sewing machine, 
plastic set and  water tank or  as  alternate 
Rs.35000/-.” 

3.   

Record made available by the petitioner, 

shows that the decree-in-original was passed on

                                         -2- 

21.09.2019 while petitioner assailed the same in 

appeal  on  08.11.2019,  after  one  month  and 

sixteen  days  which,  under  the  law,  had  to  be 

filed  within  thirty  days.  The  learned  Appellate 

Court  dismissed  the  appeal  on  the  ground  of 

limitation,  inter-alia,  observing  that  „though the 

petitioner had taken the ground of sickness but did 

not provide any medical certificate, thus failed to 

explain each and every day‟s delay, mandatory to 

ask for condonation.‟  

4.   

It 

is 

important 

to  mention 

that 

judgment-in-appeal  was  passed  on  20.01.2020 

while 

instant  writ  petition  was 

filed  on 

01.04.2021  i.e.  after  delay  of  more  than  one 

year and two months. 

5.   

Learned counsel argued that the learned 

Family Court failed to appreciate the evidence in 

its  true  perspective;  that  sufficient  cause  has 

been  put  forth  for  condonation  of  delay  which 

was  supported  by  medical  certificate  but  the 

appellant  had  been  non-suited  on  technical 

ground of limitation in derogation to the principle 

that  law  favours  decision  on  merits  instead  of 

technicalities.  

6.   

7.   

Heard, record examined.  

There  is  no  denial  that  appeal  before 

the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  had  been 

filed beyond the prescribed period of thirty days 

while it is also an admitted fact that instant  writ 

petition,  whereby  petitioner  intends  to  have 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 1343-2021 

                                         -3- 

equitable and discretionary relief, has  been filed  

with  a  delay  of  more    than  one  year  and  two 

months. 

8.   

During the course of arguments, learned 

counsel  tried  to  justify  inordinate  delay  in  terms 

that  petitioner  had  been  incarceration  for  two 

months  but  whether  this  would  be  sufficient 

even to ask for? Answer would be in negative for 

the reason that there is no explanation of rest of 

the long standing period of one year, even, if the 

period  of  two  months  is  excluded.  Like  the 

ground  of  sickness  in  appeal,  the  ground  being 

pressed  for  condoning  the  delay/laches  in  filing 

of  instant  writ  petition  is  also  without  any 

substance and is accordingly repelled. 

9.   

The 

petitioner 

intends 

to 

have 

discretionary  and  equitable 

relief  without 

exploring  malafide, 

illegality 

or  material 

irregularity in the judgment of the learned Family 

Court. It is cardinal principle that law favours the 

vigilant  and  not  the  indolent.  Undoubtedly,  law 

leans  adjudication  of  cases  on  merits  instead  of 

technicalities yet the fact remains that each and 

every  decision  on  the  point  of  limitation  could 

not  be  set  at  naught  on  any  flimsy  ground 

without  reasonable,  justifiable  and  convincing 

cause  which  can  be  assessed  and  termed  as 

“sufficient”.  

10. 

Another  important  aspect  of  the  matter 

is  that  petitioner  had  already  availed  statutory 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 1343-2021 

                                         -4- 

remedy  of  appeal.  Recourse  in  terms  of  Article 

199 of the Constitution to question the decisions 

of  the  two  courts  of  competent  jurisdiction,  in 

absence  of  any  illegality  or  jurisdictional  defect 

would  not  be  appropriate,  particularly  when  the 

conduct of the petitioner appears to be lethargic 

throughout.  

11. 

In  the  present  case,  the 

litigation 

commenced  in  January  2016,  finally  decided  by 

the learned Family Court in September 2019. The 

petitioner assailed the said decision in November 

2019, while his appeal was dismissed in January, 

2020.  Thus  a  family  dispute  consumed  more 

than  four  years  for  reaching  final  conclusion 

before the two forums which had to be decided 

within six months from the date of institution 

in  terms  of  section  12A  of  the  Family  Courts 

Act, 1964. 

12. 

It is cardinal principle that „equity aids 

the vigilant and not the indolent‟.  He,  who 

knocks  the  door  of  equity  court  with  inordinate 

delay, has to justify such delay. There is no cavil 

with 

the  proposition 

that 

there  exists  no 

statutory provision prescribing limitation for filing 

of writ petition but that does not mean to sleep 

upon a right for unlimited time and to agitate the 

same  when  other  party  resorts  his/her  right, 

particularly 

in 

family  matters  where 

the 

legislative 

intent 

is  unambiguous 

regarding 

decisions summarily.

                                         -5- 

13. 

The  delay  in  approaching  the  forum 

provided  through  enactment  is  matter  of  fact 

and gives/creates valuable rights in favour of the 

other party but even approaching this Court with 

inordinate  delay  of  14/15  months  when  is 

examined  in  juxtaposition,  leads  to  form  a  view 

that  facts  of  the  case  attract  the  maxim „delay 

defeats equity‟.  

14. 

The  conduct  of 

the  petitioner 

in 

approaching  this  Court  asking  for  relief  in  terms 

of Article 199 of the Constitution in the backdrop 

of the facts of the instant case cannot be termed 

as aboveboard rather appears to be negligent. In 

such  like  situation,  equitable  relief  by  this  Court 

in  exercise  of  its  extra  ordinary  jurisdiction 

cannot  be  granted.  The  Hon‟ble  Apex  Court  in 

case  of  “Muhammad Arif v. Uzma Afzal and 

others”  (2011  SCMR  374)  has  graciously  laid 

down that:- 

“There is no cavil to the proposition that 
the "conduct of petitioner can be taken into 
consideration  in  allowing  or  disallowing 
equitable relief in constitutional jurisdiction. 
The principle that the Court should lean in 
favour of adjudication of causes on merits, 
appears to be available for invocation only 
when  the  person  relying  on  it  himself 
comes to the Court with clean hands and 
equitable  considerations  also  lie  in  his 
favour.  High  Court  in  exercise  of  writ 
jurisdiction is bound to proceed on maxim 
"he who seeks equity must do equity". 
Constitutional jurisdiction is an equitable 
jurisdiction. Whoever comes to High Court 
to seek relief has to satisfy the conscience 
of the Court that he has clean hands. Writ 
jurisdiction cannot be exercised in aid of 
injustice. The High Court will not grant 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 1343-2021 

                                         -6- 

relief under this Article when the petitioner 
does not come to the Court with clean 
hands. He may claim relief only when he 
himself is not violating provisions of law, 
especially of the law under which he is 
claiming entitlement".” 

15. 

Having  examined  the  case  from  every 

angle, petitioner has not been able to make out 

a case for exercise of constitutional jurisdiction in 

terms  of  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  for 

reasons (supra). Dismissed in limine.
