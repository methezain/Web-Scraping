Petitioners  of this writ petition joined civil service  in 1985 after their  selection in

the Competitive  Examination for Central Superior  Services  (CSS) held by Federal

Public  Service  Commission and they were allocated  lncome  Tax Group (lnland

Revenue  Service).  On completion  of mandatory  specialized  training and courses,

they assumed  the charge of Assistant Commissioner (BS-17) lncome  Tax. !n view of
their excellent  performance, they were promoted to the post of Deputy
Commissioner,  lncome Tax (BS-18)  and on the basis of brilliant track record; they

were  further promoted  to the post  of Additional commissioner lncome  Tax in (BS-19).

For their further promotion  to (BS-20) petitioner  were fully qualified  and met the

eligibility  criteria,  therefore,  their cases  were  presented to Central  Selection  Board

(CSB)  but to the utter surprise  of the petitioners,  CSB in its meeting  held on 3'd of

October 2011  passed  the order of their supersession. Petitioners  were not informed
about the reasons of their supersession, however, during the pendency of writ

petition following reasons  were  communicated:-

"Since thev had not achieved the requisite  threshold  and their
reputation,  known to the Members of CSB,  were of beinq corrupt
and in-efficient". (emphasis provided).

Petitioners betonging  to different groups  have  been superseded  on the personal

procured  through  due  process of law

General  reputation  and reports from  secret agencies  can never be made basrs of

Petitioners  reached to the present  sfafus  on the basis of their performance,
knowtedge, experience  and achievements  which  they  made  in their respective  field

as CivilServanfs

General  reputation of being corrupt  has always been a disputed question  which  even
otherwise  cannot be adjudged  without  confronting  the person against whom such
allegations  are leveled

There is no rational,  togic  and prudence behind the  formula  of awarding marks  for the
purpose  of promotion, deferment,  and  supersession

Establishment  Division  ptaying  havoc with the process of law and mandate  of the
dictums  of the supeior  courts of the country

Authorities
That promotion  to higher grade is always  considered under relevant rules and
regutations.  Seniority rs nof the sole criteria  for promotion and reasons for non-
promotion have  been communicated to the petitioners

That CSB on the basis of lfs collective wisdom  decides/recommends  the most  suitable
officers  for promotion to higher  grade

That  promotion to setection  posf is not based on mechanical  or mathematicalformula

only
That, no discrimination whatsoever  has been committed  with petitioners  as for
promotion  to these posfs besrde s length  of seruice.  Other qualities  like relevance  of
experience,  circulation  value, quality and  output work, integrity, training, variety  of
experience  are also examined by the CSB  and thereafter  promotion  fo fhese  posfs  ts
made on fhe basis of selection  on merit in terms of Section 9(2) of the Civil Servanfs

Act,1973
That, the officers junior  to the appellants/petitioner  had  better threshold and the  CSB
on the basis  of its cottective wisdom,  recommended their promotion  over the
petitioners
That,  the posts carrying basic  pay  scale 20 falls in the middle management  post and
promotion to these posfs rs being  made  on the basts of se/ection  on merit
That,  in addition to the circulation value  and varie$ of experience the incumbents are
considered for promotion keeping in view pen picture  drawn in the Performance
Evatuation Repods, Training Evatuation  Repofts, reputation  of the officer  about  his
integlg  and performance  as known  to the Board  Members and this potential  cannot
be judged  by mathematicat  formula  on the basis of seniority cum  ffness and  the CSB
have to apply'tts collective wisdom.
That as per Promotion  Policy  2007, 70% weight  rs assrgned  to the PERs  of the officer,
15%  weight  is assigned  to the training  and 15% marks  are reserued  for the CSB

2. 

First aspect, which requires determination  is that, whether, this court  has the

jurisdiction to adjudicate  upon the matter  and issue  appropriate  writ, in the light of the

prayer  made  by petitioners  and objection  raised  by respondents.

For convenience,  section  4(1Xb) of the Service  Tribunal  Act, 1973  is being

provided  hereunder:-

,,No  appeat  shal lie to a Tribunal  against an order or decision of a depaftmental

authority  determining  the  fitness or otherwise of a person to be appointed to or hold a

pafticutar  post or to be promoted to a higher  grade"

W.P Nos.3483,3511,3512  ot 2011,58  & 42712012.

7

Similarly, proviso  to Sub-section (2) of Section 22 of Civil Servants  Act, 1973

provides  as under:-

"Provided  that no representation  shall  lie on mafters  relating  to the determination  of
ffness of a person  to hold a particular  post  or to be promoted  to a higher  post or

grade".

Moreover,  2nd proviso  to Rule 4(1) of Civil Servants  Appeal  Rules, 1977 states

as herein  below:-

.Provided fufther that, no appeal  or review  shall lie on matters  relating  to the
determination of fitness  of a person  to hold  a particular post or to be promoted  to a
higher  Post  or grade."

3.  As is evident  from  above provisions, no remedy by way of filing appeal etc.  is

provided  to civil servant against  determination of "fitness" therefore, this aspect itself

is a ground to invoke the constitutional  jurisdiction  of this court. In this regard

guidance  has been sought from  the judgments  reilorted as PLD 1989 SC-26, 2000

psc 599, PLD  2OO3  (SC) 175, 2OO1 PLC (CS)  878, 2003 PLC (CS) 503, (LHC)  and

order  dated.20-05-2011 passed by learned single bench  of lslamabad High Court in

Writ petition  No.1 160 of 2011. ln this view of the matter,  it is held that writ petition  on

the issue brought  before the court  is maintainable.

4.  The Central  Selection  Board in its meeting  held in November,2007  decided  to
award its 15 marks  on the basis of Members' views on the officer about his integrity,

performance  and pen picture  in synopsis of PERs for the Iast 5 years and the

Training Evaluation  Reports.  The CSB  had also devised a key for award  of marks,  as

under:

5. 

Learned  Federal  Service  Tribunal,  vide its judgment dated 08.10.2008  had,

however  directed the Secretary Establishment  and Chairman, FPSC  to either  lay

down  objective  criteria  for award  of 15 marks  by CSB  or withdraw  the same as it was

in direct  conflict with Supreme  Court's  earlier  order dated  25.09.2006. The order  of

the learned Federal  Service  Tribunal has attained  finality after Supreme Court of

Pakistan had dismissed the CPLA on 14.07.2009.  ln its meeting  held in Dec. 2009

the CSB had decided  that the officers on the panel may fall in three  categories i.e

top most  being Category-1,  the middle  one Category-ll and the remainder  Category-lll

and CSB  marks may be awarded on the basis of officer's  integrity,  performance

known to the Board's  Members  and the pen picture  contained  in the Performance

Evaluation  Reports  and Training  Evaluation  Reports. Present CSB decided to

continue  with the said  process  as wellthe award  of marks  as under :-

CATEGORY

MARKS
12TO 14

The  formula of allocation of 15 marks by the Central Selection Board  is based

on Members'  view on the officers about  his (i) integrity, (ii) performance  (iii) pen

picture in synopsis of performance evaluation  reports (PERs) for the last five years

and  (iv) Training Evaluation  Reports.

6.  Award  of 15 marks by CSB resulting  into grant  of promotion or denial to the
same brings  noticeable  proportion  of litigation before the High courts,  Service

Tribunals  and ultimately  Apex Court.  lncidentally,  mechanism  in which these marks

are awarded and the manner in which  this formula being applied  has received

displeasure  from the superior courts  and observations  about same have  already

been  made, through  different  pronouncements.

7. 

ln a reported  judgment,  2006 PLC (CS)  564 learned  Division  Bench of High

Court of Sindh has held that the Bar of 212 of the Constitution  is not attracted  in

cases relating  to determination of fitness and further that the qualification score is to

be taken  into consideration in conjunction with other criteria such as seniority, length

of service, varied experience, grading  in NIPA course  and also the crucial factor of

quality  and outpuUintegrity.  lt has also been  held that when a civil servant  secures

the prescribed threshold,  he is entitled  for promotion, if other factors are also

satisfied.  Even in the case of less than the prescribed  score the other  prescribed

conditions  would also be considered.  All the Constitutional  Petitions were  allowed

with the direction to reconvene the meeting of the Central Selection  Board to make

recommendation for promotion  in accordance  with law and in terms  of directions

contained  in Para 20 of the Judgment.  The judgments have been up-held  by the

Honourable  Supreme  court  of Pakistan."

g.  Latest dictum has been laid down  in the case titled Secretary  Revenue

Division,  CBR/Federal Board  of Revenue, lslamabad  VS Gul Muhammad  and others

reported  as2011  SCMR 295, operative  part of which is reproduced  herein  below:-

,'The 
above  matter  came up before  this Court and  the iudgment  of the Servlce
Tribunat  was  upheld  vide cited iudgment decided on 25th Sept.  2006,
conctuding  para there  from  is reproduced  herein  below:-

Learned  D.A.G, despite our repeated question, could not
satisfy  us on this aspect of the case, therefore,  we are of the
opinion  that decision with regard to promotion of the Officer
cannot be left on the discretion of Members of the Board' There
must be some criteria to iudge  the pertormance  of a candidate
because promotion was denied to the officer on the ground  that he
does not fulfill the criteria. When there is no criteria,  then how a
person  can be denied promotion, therefore,  the Seruice Tribunal
has rightly  obserued that the Board must bring  more  obiectivity in
the criteria."

W.P Nos.3483  , 3511 , 3512 of  2011 , 58 & 42712012.

't0

ln pursuance of the above judgment  of this Court,  we have no reason  to take
different view other  than which has already been expressed  tn the said  case.  ln the
circumstances,  the relief  has, therefore, been rightly  granted to the respondents  and
petitions being without  substance  are hereby drsmlssed  with costs, because  knowing
wellthat already  a different view  has already  been  taken  by the Supreme  Court, same
point has again been agitated without any justffication.  When  we asked if order dated
29-03-2010 was implemented  or not, learned  counsel replied that  promotion  stood
granted  to the respondents.  Be that as it may, the concerned authority  of the
depaftment is directed  to comply  with the order of the Seruice  Tribunal, if not
implemented as yet and submit report  wilhin a period  for seven  days to Registrar  for

our  perusal in Chambers."

g. 

ln my humble  estimation issue before this court is not merely supersession of

civil servants rather more serious to that, and it is dis-obedience  of judgment  of

Hon'ble  Supreme  Court, frustrating  the directions  contained  therein and malicious

act to undermine the efforts  of building the culture of rule of law. lt is constitutional

obligation of the High Court to enforce the law declared by apex court through
different pronouncements.  lt  really is beyond comprehension  that executive

functionaries  would become  insensitive  about any judgment containing  direction  to

them, by ignoring it or keeping aside  the same.  Any court of law does not render  the

judgment for academic  discussion but with the object  and purpose  to undo the wrong

and enforce  the rights.

l

.i

10.  Article 1gg of the constitution makes it mandatory  for all courts in Pakistan  to
surrender  before  any decision  of court of apex  and follow  the same as law of the

land. lt is not a matter of discretion but binding upon  the courts and for convenience

sake said  article  is reproduced  herein  below:-

"Article 189:- Decisions  of Supreme  Court binding on other courts:'

Any  decision  of the Supreme  Court  shatl, to the extent  that  it decides  a question  of law
or is based upon  or annunciates  a principte  of law be binding  on all other  courts in

Pakistan"

11. Unfortunately,  trend of showing  defiance, disobedience  and non-compliance  of
the orders  of the superior  court is on increase  and this is the appropriate  time  where

W.P Nos.3483,  351  1 , 3512  ol  2011  , 58 & 427120'12.

1'l

High Court must become more vigilant and enforce its authority for the

implementation  of the orders  of the Hon'ble Supreme Court  and persons  on the helm

of affairs who through  cryptic  approach  are found in ridiculing the orders, must be

dealt  with strictly  in accordance  with law.

12.  I have no hesitation in observing  that after clear direction  by the Hon'ble

Supreme Court, through  judgment  supra  all the proceedings  of Central Selection
Board,  in violation of observations/directions  of apex court,  have no sanctity

whatsoever.  The executive functionaries  are expected to act in aid of order  passed

by the superior courts  and implement  the same in the spirit  in which they are passed.

It is common observation  that when some decision by executive  functionaries is

taken in violation of any judgmenUorder  of the superior courts,  beneficiaries of such

order  show  arrogance  and deprived  show their  dismay  about the judicial system-

13.  It is simply  unbelievable that civil servants having stinking reputation  of
involvement in the corrupt practices  would be kept in service  with a license  to pollute

the entire system.  When it comes  to taking action  against  such  element, no evidence

or substance is found to warrant action against  them.  Now, question arises that how

can those civil servants  be denied benefit of promotion  simply  for the reason  that

some  of the members  of CSB had personal knowledge  or in their estimation officer is

involved  in corrupt practices?  lt is amazing  to note that, no officer against whom

presumption  of corruption is made,  confronted  with such suppositions  and even

interviewed  to seek  explanation about  any impression lurking  in the minds  of learned
members  of CSB. One reason of not confronting  could  definitely  be, want of

incriminating material and other may be source of personal information,  which  in the

understanding  of law is just a hearsay.  Admittedly at the time of CSB, no disciplinary
proceedings against  superseded civil servants  were pending,  on the ground of

charges  of corruption.  Allegations of corruption  against  any citizen  of the country  are

W.P Nos.3483,  351  1, 3512  of 2011,  58 & 427  12012.

12

serious but when such type of allegations are leveled against civil servants and that

too of top or middle management,  repercussion of such  allegations are found more

than serious and grave in nature. Such allegations against highly  placed civil  servant

besides  bringing  stigma  to his career  disrupt  entire fiber of his family, professional

and sociat life and at times proves fatal to his life. ln the era of awareness,  rule of

Iaw and judicial  activism, it is unexpected of the executive functionaries, to play  with

the careers  of civil servant  on hypothesis,  surmises  and with subjective  approach.

The superior courts of the country  have  jealously  safeguarded the rights of citizens

and always disapproved,  actions taken with malafide  intention,  ulterior motives  and

nefarious designs. Subjective  formula  being  followed  is like declaring civil servants

as "good guy" and "bad guy" which is in direct violation of Articles  3,4,5,9,10-A,  14,

25 of the Constitution  of the lslamic Republic  of Pakistan.

14.  ln this view  of the matter instant  writ petitions  are allowed,  formula of award  of

15 marks  on the discretion  of CSB is declared as illegal,  superficial,  unconstitutional,

against the dictums  of court of apex, non-transparent,  result of adamant  approach,

whimsical,  sham, unprecedented, infringement to constitutiona! guarantees  and
principles of natural justice, therefore,  same is set aside. The respondent

,Establishment  Division  is directed  to implement the judgment  of Hon'ble  Supreme
Court,  delivered  in Civil Petitions  Nos.1083,  58 to 60, 443 and 444 ol 2010, in its

letter  and spirit and restructure  the formula of award  of 15 marks, in accordance  with

guidelines  provided therein. All the meetings of CSB, subsequent to the above
pronouncement  of  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court, therefore, are declared as
unconstitutional  without jurisdiction  and unjust which are held to be of no
consequence.  The authorities  concerned  are directed  to hold de-novo  proceedings  of

Central  Selection  Board and on the basis of restructured  formula allthe superseded

W.P Nos.3483,  351  1 , 3512  ot  2011  , 58 & 42712012.

13

and deferred civil servants  must be  considered  . again, as  their

supersession/deferment  on the basis of existed  formula applied by CSB is totally,

illegal. However,  civil  servants  who earned  the promotion,  without superseding other

civil servants  shall continue  to hold their present  posts and positions.
