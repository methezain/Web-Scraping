Mr. Naveed Shehzad  Ch., Advocate for petitioner.
Mr. Muhammad  Sohail Khursheed,  State Counsel.
Arshad, Inspector/SHO and Niaz, ASI,  P.S. Tarnol,

Complainant  in person.

Through  this Crl. Misc. petitiory the petitioner

has applied for post-arrest  bail in case FIR No.458,  dated

07 .10.2019, lJ / Ss 392 / 411, PPC,  P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad.

2. 

Brief facts referred  in the instant FIR registered

on the complaint  of Usama  Naeem  Khan are that on

07.10.2019 at about 03:15  p.m. three Persons  aged about

25 to 40 years visited  his house in order to hire basement

and posed  themselves as Government  servants. Thev

again  came  at about  04:15 p.m. to settle  the matter so

they called  them inside the house, one of them was

bulky and wearing  black colour shalwar qarr.eez,

second one was slim, wearing boski shalwar  qameez

and third one was wearing blue colour clothes, as soon

as they entered in the house they pointed their pistol

and tide the complainant  and his family with rope  and

snatched 09  tola goid jewelry, cash amount

Rs.1,00,000/-,  MAC Laptop and fled au/?Y in their white

corolla  car having green  colour number plate.

3. 

Learned  counsel for the petitioner contends  that

petitioner is innocent and has falsely been implicated  in

this case,  even he has not been identified  by the

witnesses  of this case  during identification  parade;  that

total recovery  in this case  is approximately Rs.4,00,000/-

which is beyond the looted amount  as alleged  by the

complainant  in the FIR and as such case falls within  the

concept  of further  inquiry; that mere pendency of other

criminal  cases  against the petitioner is no ground  to

refuse  the bail application.

4. 

Conversely,  learned State Counsel alongwith

complainant contends that petitioner  has been identified

during the course of identification  parade with specific

role and he is also involved in other criminal cases of

similar nature, therefore, he is  not entitled for

concession  of post-arrest bail.

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused.

Tentative  assessment of record  reveals that

petitioner has been involved in case FIR No.458,  dated

07.10.2019,  U/S 392/411, PPC, P.S. Tarnol, Islamabad

with the specific  role of comrnitting  armed  robbery.

7. 

The record  reflects that petitioner  was  arrested

on 27.10.20L9 and was identified during the course of

identification  parade  held on 15.11.20L9,  even challan

has been submitted in the Court on 24.12.2019  and

charge  has been framed  but due to Covid-L9  pandemic

trial is not in progress.  Rs.1,00,000/-  and four gold

bangles were recovered from the petitioner  on

18.12.2019  and petitioner is operating  in a  gar.g

alongwith other co-accused. The police  record  reflects

that 19 other  criminal cases of armed robbery  have been

registered  against the petitioner,  whereas  L0 cases are

from Islamabad jurisdiction.  I.O states that petitioner

was convicted in some  of the cases but record is not yet

available.

8. 

The entire background of the case reflects that

petitioner  is hardened and desperate  criminal involved

in number  of cases, although  pendency  of cases is no

ground  for refusal  of bail as highlighted  in 2070yLR624

(Mustansar Yousaf Sukhera  VS Stater but this  aspect

has to be seen  in the light of facts and circumstances  of

each case, especially when  petitioner  is prima-facie

connected with hideous offence by way of recovery and

even  there is no ill will or malafide on the part of

complainant, who has identified  the petitioner in jail

during  the course of identification  parade, therefore,  no

case of bail is made  out on merits and the same  is

hereby dismisseiL  However, at this stage,  while relying

upon  20LL SCMR  7332  (Rehmat Ullah VS The  Statel.

learned trial Court seized with the matter  is directed to

conclude  the trial within  period of six (06) months after

resumption  of Court work, suspended  due to Covid-19

pandemic
