Proceedings 

31.03.2022  Mr. M. Nasir Shehzad, Advocate for petitioner.  

Syed Faizan Ali Gardezi, Advocate and Syed Ijaz 
Ahmed  Gillani,  Advocate  for  respondents  No.2 
& 3. 

The instant petition calls in question order 

dated  09.06.2021,  whereby  learned  trial  court 

(respondent  No.1)  awarded  Rs.50000/-  as  ad-

interim maintenance to respondent No.3. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia 

contended 

that 

under 

the 

facts 

and 

circumstances,  ad-interim  maintenance  is  not 

realistic  and  is  high;  in  this  behalf,  it  was 

contended  that  petitioner  is  not  a  person  of 

means and is suffering from indisposition which 

involved  expenditure  for  medical 

treatment 

hence he is unable to afford the same.  

3. 

Learned counsel for respondents No.2 & 3 

inter  alia  contended  that  impugned  order  was 

passed after taking into account the resources of 

the petitioner and after recording his statement.  

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  learned  counsel 

for 

the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

the 

documents,  placed  on  record,  examined  with 

their able assistance.  

5. 

The  grievance,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petition, has been mentioned hereinabove.

6. 

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  of  fixation  of 

ad-interim  maintenance 

in 

the 

sum  of 

Rs.50,000/-.  The  examination  of  the  impugned 

order  shows  that  the  same  was  passed  after 

recording  the  statement  of  the  parties  and 

keeping in view the pleadings.  

7. 

This  Court  was  informed  that  the  main 

petition/suit is still pending. The impugned order 

was  passed in  June, 2021 and since then, almost 

nine  months  have  lapsed.  As  reflected  in  the 

impugned  order,  it  was  passed  on  the  statement 

of  the  parties  and  after  comparing  the  same; 

nothing was brought on record to contradict that 

any  observation  made  in  the  impugned  order  is 

not correct.  

8. 

It  is  trite  law  that  a  writ  petition,  against 

ad-interim order, is not maintainable unless same 

suffers from gross illegality or jurisdictional error, 

which is not the case in the petition in hand.  

9. 

In  view  of  foregoing,  no  interference,  as 

such, is required in the impugned order, however, 

it  would  be  appropriate  that  suit  for  recovery, 

filed  by  respondents  No.2  &  3,  be  disposed  of 

expeditiously.  

10. 

For  the  above  reasons,  instant  petition  is 

without  merit  hence 

is  dismissed,  however, 

learned trial court is directed to conclude the trial 

within a period of three months from the date of 

receipt of this order.
