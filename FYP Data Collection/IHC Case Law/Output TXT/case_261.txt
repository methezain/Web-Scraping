MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the  instant  writ 

petition the petitioner, Allama Iqbal Open University (“A.I.O.U.”), impugns 

the order dated 10.12.2020 passed by the President  of Pakistan  whereby 

the  representation  filed  by  A.I.O.U.  under  Article  32  of  the  Establishment 

of  the  Office  of  Wafaqi  Mohtasib  (Ombudsman)  Order,  1983  (“the  1983 

Order”) against the revised order / findings dated 28.08.2020 of the Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  (“the  Ombudsman”)  was  dismissed.  Through  the  said  revised 

order dated 28.08.2020, the Ombudsman accepted the complaint filed  by 

respondent  No.2,  Shahid  Jamil,  and  recommended  that  an  amount  of 

Rs.9,26,168.50  deducted  by  A.I.O.U.  from  respondent  No.2‟s  pension  be 

refunded  to  him.  Earlier the  Ombudsman  had  rejected  respondent  No.2‟s 

complaint vide order dated 17.06.2020.  

FACTUAL BACKGROUND:- 

2. 

The  record  shows  that  Nisar  Ahmad  Aziz  (“Mr.  Aziz”)  had  been 

awarded scholarship for Ph.D in Business Administration at a university 

in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a period  of  five  years  out  of  the  income  from 

the  endowment  fund  of  A.I.O.U.  At  that  time  Mr.  Aziz  was  serving  as 

Assistant  Professor  in  the  Department  of  Business  Administration  at 

A.I.O.U.  On  02.08.2000,  Mr.  Aziz  had  executed  a  surety  bond  assuring 

A.I.O.U. that he shall inform A.I.O.U. of the date of his return to Pakistan

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

and  shall  serve  A.I.O.U.  for  a  period  of  five  years.  Mr.  Aziz  had  also 

assured  A.I.O.U.  that  in  case  of  the  breach  of  any  of  the  terms  and 

conditions of the surety bond by him, respondent No.2 and Iqbal Hussain 

as the guarantors would be held responsible for the payment of damages 

as detailed in paragraph (b) of the said bond. For the purpose of clarity,

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

4. 

After  availing  the  said  scholarship  and  obtaining  a  Ph.D  degree, 

Mr.  Aziz  returned  to  Pakistan  and  resumed  his  duties  at  A.I.O.U.  on 

15.06.2006.  Mr.  Aziz  is  said  to  have  taught  at  A.I.O.U.  between 

15.06.2006  and  13.01.2009.  On  13.01.2009,  he  again  proceeded  to  the 

United  Kingdom  on leave  which had  been  sanctioned  for  a period  of 19 

days  i.e.,  up  to  31.01.2009.  His  application  dated  01.02.2009  for  an 

extension in his leave period by five weeks was turned down by A.I.O.U. 

vide  email  dated  02.02.2009.  Mr. Aziz  did  not  return  to  Pakistan  and  on 

24.07.2009  sent  his  resignation  to  A.I.O.U.  Vide  office  order  dated 

16.07.2012,  the  Vice  Chancellor  of  A.I.O.U.  accepted  Mr.  Aziz‟s 

resignation  with  effect  from  24.07.2009,  “in anticipation of approval of 

the Executive Council”  of  A.I.O.U.  In  the  said  office  order,  it  was 

mentioned  that  an  outstanding  amount  of  Rs.18,52,336.66  would  be 

recovered  from  Mr.  Aziz  or  his  guarantors,  and  that  the  period  from 

01.02.2009  to  24.07.2009  had  been  treated  as  unauthorized  absence 

from duty.  

5. 

On  09.06.2014,  respondent  No.2,  who  was  the  guarantor  for  Mr. 

Aziz‟s  obligations  under  the  surety  bond,  retired  from  service.  He  was 

serving as System  Analyst, Computer Centre, A.I.O.U. at the time of his 

retirement.  A.I.O.U.‟s  office  order  dated  03.07.2014  shows  that  there 

was nothing outstanding against respondent No.2 except Rs.9,26,168.50 

being  the  50%  share  of  the  amount  outstanding  against  Mr.  Aziz  due  to 

the breach of his obligations under the surety bond. A.I.O.U. withheld the 

said amount from respondent No.2‟s pension.  

6. 

On  13.03.2020,  respondent  No.2  filed  a  complaint  before  the 

Ombudsman  seeking  a  direction  to  A.I.O.U.  to  release  the  withheld 

pension  amounting  to  Rs.9,26,168.50.  A.I.O.U., 

in 

its  reply  dated 

19.05.2020, took the position that the Executive Council of A.I.O.U. in its 

93rd  meeting  held  on  16.08.2012  had  decided  not  to  accept  the 

resignation  submitted  by  Mr.  Aziz  till  the  settlement  of  his  outstanding 

liabilities  to  A.I.O.U.  On  17.06.2020,  the  Ombudsman  closed  the 

investigation  in  the  matter.  The  Ombudsman  in  its  order  had  recorded 

that Mr. Aziz had failed to deposit the damages for breach of the terms of 

the  surety  bond  furnished  by  him  and  therefore  an  amount  of 

 
 
4  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

Rs.9,26,168.50  had  been  recovered 

from  respondent  No.2  vide 

A.I.O.U.‟s office order dated 03.07.2014. Respondent No.2 filed a review 

application  before  the  Ombudsman  on  16.07.2020.  On  28.08.2020,  the 

Ombudsman  accepted  respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  and  recommended 

that the  amount  deducted  from  respondent  No.2‟s  pension  be refunded 

to him. A.I.O.U.‟s representation to the President of Pakistan against the 

said  order  dated  28.08.2020  was  turned  down  vide  order  dated 

10.12.2020. The said concurrent orders passed by the Ombudsman and 

the  President  of  Pakistan  have  been  assailed  by  A.I.O.U.  in  the  instant 

writ petition.  

CONTENTIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER:- 

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  A.I.O.U.,  after  narrating  the  facts  leading  to 

the  filing  of  the  instant  petition,  submitted  that  respondent  No.2  had 

stood as a guarantor for the fulfillment of Mr. Aziz‟s obligations under the 

surety bond dated 02.08.2000; that one of Mr. Aziz‟s obligations was that 

upon the completion of his scholarship, he would return to Pakistan and 

serve A.I.O.U. for a period of five years; that although Mr. Aziz did return 

to Pakistan after the completion of his scholarship and served in A.I.O.U. 

from  15.06.2006  to  13.01.2009  but  before  completing  five  years  of 

service he went abroad on leave which was sanctioned only for 19 days 

and never returned to rejoin his duties; that he sent his resignation from 

abroad  which  has  not  been  accepted  by  the  Executive  Council  of 

A.I.O.U.; that Mr. Aziz was bound to repay the amount spent by A.I.O.U. 

on his scholarship and on his default, respondent No.2, being one of the 

two  guarantors,  was  liable  to  return  half  of  the  said  amount  i.e., 

Rs.9,26,168.50;  that  on  17.06.2020,  the  Ombudsman  had  rejected 

respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  against  the  deduction  of  the  said  amount 

from  his  pension  but  subsequently  the  review  application  filed  by 

respondent  No.2  was  allowed  by  the  same  incumbent  vide  order  dated 

28.08.2020 without specifying whether there was any error apparent on 

the face of the earlier order dated 17.06.2020; that the Ombudsman and 

the  President  of  Pakistan  concurrently  erred  by  not  appreciating  that  a 

suit had been instituted by Mr. Aziz regarding the amount in dispute with 

A.I.O.U.; that respondent No.2 had appeared as the petitioner‟s witness 

 
 
5  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

in the said suit and had deposed that the amount of Rs.9,26,168.50 which 

A.I.O.U. had sought against Mr. Aziz in its counterclaim had already been 

deducted  by  A.I.O.U.  from  respondent  No.2‟s  pension;  that  this 

deposition  of  respondent  No.2  was 

instrumental 

in  A.I.O.U.‟s 

counterclaim against Mr. Aziz being defeated; that the Ombudsman and 

the  President  of  Pakistan  concurrently  erred  by  not  appreciating  that 

respondent No.2‟s complaint was grossly time barred; and that since the 

orders  passed  by  the  Ombudsman  and  the  President  of  Pakistan  suffer 

from  jurisdictional  errors,  they  are  liable  to  be  set-aside.  Learned 

counsel for A.I.O.U. prayed for the writ petition to be allowed in terms of 

the relief sought therein. 

CONTENTIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENT NO.2:-  

8. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2  submitted 

that since A.I.O.U. did not accept Mr. Aziz‟s resignation, does this mean that 

he  is  still  an  employee of A.I.O.U.?  He also submitted  that  if Mr. Aziz  is  still 

an  employee  of  A.I.O.U.,  why  are  the  guarantors  being  held  liable  for  his 

default in not serving A.I.O.U. for a period of five years upon his return from 

abroad?  He  further  submitted  that  A.I.O.U.  has  not  explained  the  present 

legal  status  of  Mr.  Aziz‟s  employment  with  A.I.O.U.;  that  A.I.O.U.  has  never 

passed  an  order  regarding  Mr.  Aziz‟s  dismissal  from  service  or  his 

superannuation;  that  in  the  service  parlance,  there  is  no  concept  of 

„anticipatory approval‟;  that  upon  the  acceptance  of  Mr.  Aziz‟s  resignation 

on 24.07.2009, respondent No.2 could not be held liable for Mr. Aziz‟s failure 

to  complete  five  years  of  service  with  A.I.O.U.  after  his  return  to  Pakistan; 

that after Mr. Aziz‟s return to Pakistan, respondent No.2‟s liability under the 

guarantee  came  to  an  end;  that  it  is  A.I.O.U.  that  permitted  Mr.  Aziz  to 

proceed abroad on leave; that respondent No.2 cannot be held liable for Mr. 

Aziz‟s  default  in  rejoining  his  duties  after  the  completion  of  his  ex-Pakistan 

leave period of 19 days; that A.I.O.U. did not take any action against Mr. Aziz 

for  the recovery  of damages or the amount spent on his education abroad; 

that A.I.O.U. should have filed a civil suit for recovery against Mr. Aziz; and 

that  it  is  only  when  Mr.  Aziz  refused  to  make  payment  that  recourse  could 

have been made to the guarantors.  

 
 
6  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

9. 

Furthermore, 

it  was  submitted  that 

it  was  respondent  No.2‟s 

fundamental right to receive his pension upon his retirement on 09.06.2014; 

that under Section 11 of the Pensions Act, 1871, respondent No.2‟s pension 

could  not  have  been  withheld;  that  pension  is  a  matter  of  right  and  not  a 

bounty of the State; that even for the execution of a money decree, pension 

cannot  be stopped;  that  the  provisions  of the  Allama  Iqbal  Open  University 

Act,  1974  as  well  as  the  rules  made  thereunder  do  not  authorize  the 

Executive Council of A.I.O.U. to withhold a retired employee‟s pension; that 

the  delay  in  filing  of  the  complaint  before  the  Ombudsman  was  because 

respondent No.2 had filed an application dated 14.07.2014 asserting therein 

that  his  pension  had  been  illegally  withheld;  that  this  fact  is  clearly 

mentioned  in  respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  as  well  as  in  the  Ombudsman‟s 

order;  that  A.I.O.U.  had  constituted  a  committee  which  never  took  a 

decision on respondent No.2‟s grievance;  that proceedings pursuant to the 

complaint  filed  by  respondent  No.2  were  closed  due  to  the  COVID-19 

pandemic;  and  that  after  respondent  No.2  filed  a  review  application,  the 

case  was  examined  on  its  merits  by  the  Ombudsman.  Learned  counsel  for 

respondent No.2 prayed for the writ petition to be dismissed. 

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE  OMBUDSMAN‟S 
SECRETARIAT:-  

10.  Learned counsel for the Ombudsman‟s Secretariat submitted that the 

fact of the civil suit instituted by Mr. Aziz against A.I.O.U. was not brought to 

the  notice  of  the  Ombudsman;  that  had  the  Ombudsman  been  informed 

about  the  said  civil  suit,  the  proceedings  pursuant  to  respondent  No.2‟s 

complaint would have been dropped; that A.I.O.U., in its reply to respondent 

No.2‟s complaint, did not mention anything about the litigation between Mr. 

Aziz  and  A.I.O.U.;  that  even  in  the  instant  writ  petition,  it  has  not  been 

asserted that respondent No.2‟s complaint was not competent on account of 

such  litigation;  that  the  objection  as  to  the  maintainability  of  respondent 

No.2‟s complaint has only been raised by A.I.O.U. in arguments before this 

Court; that liability of respondent No.2 under the guarantee is a contractual 

liability and has no nexus with respondent No.2‟s service with A.I.O.U.; that 

in paragraph 7 of the review application, respondent No.2 had pleaded that 

A.I.O.U. had constituted a committee in 2014 to decide whether respondent 

 
 
 
7  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

No.2‟s pension could be withheld to satisfy his liability under the guarantee; 

that  the  maladministration  committed  by  A.I.O.U.  was  not  to  decide 

respondent  No.2‟s  application  dated  14.07.2014  for  the  release  of  his 

pension  despite  the  constitution  of  a  committee;  and  that  the  delay  in 

deciding  an  application  for  the  release  of  pension  is  also  an  act  of 

maladministration.  Learned  counsel  for  the  Ombudsman‟s  Secretariat 

submitted  that  the  instant  petition  may  be  decided  in  accordance  with  the 

law.  

11.  Learned counsel for A.I.O.U. in rejoinder submitted that the provisions 

of  the  Pensions  Act,  1871  do  not  apply  to  autonomous  /  statutory  bodies; 

that  even  otherwise  provisions  of  the  said  Act  provide  a  mechanism  for 

recovery  of  pension;  and  that  respondent  No.2  has  not  complied  with  the 

procedure prescribed for the recovery of pension.  

12. 

I have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the contesting 

parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able  assistance.  The  facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have  been  set  out  in  sufficient 

detail in paragraphs 2 to 6 above and need not be recapitulated.  

WHETHER THIS COURT CAN DECLARE THE PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO 
RESPONDENT  NO.2‟S  COMPLAINT  TO  BE  WITHOUT  JURISDICTION  DUE 
TO MATTER HAVING BEEN DECIDED BY THE LEARNED CIVIL COURT:-  

13. 

I  propose  in  the  first  instance  to  address  the  objection  taken  by  the 

learned counsel  for  A.I.O.U.  to  the  maintainability  of  respondent  No.2‟s 

complaint before the Ombudsman on the ground that the said complaint was 

with respect to a matter which was sub-judice before a Court.   

14.  Article 9(1) of the 1983 Order, and clause (a) of the proviso to the said 

Article reads thus:- 

“9.  Jurisdiction, functions and power of the Mohtasib.---(1) the Mohtasib 
may, on a complaint by any aggrieved person, on a reference by the 
President, the Federal Council or the National Assembly, as the case may 
be, or on a motion of the Supreme Court or a High Court made during the 
course of any proceedings before it or of his own motion undertake any 
investigation into any allegation of maladministration on the part of any 
Agency or any of its officers or employees: 

Provided  that  the  Mohtasib  shall  not  have  any  jurisdiction  to 

investigate or inquire into any matters which: 

(a)  are sub-judice before a court of competent jurisdiction  or 
judicial tribunal or board in Pakistan on the date of the receipt of 
a complaint, reference or motion by him;” 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

15.  The proviso to Article 9(1) of the 1983 Order removes from the pale of 

the Ombudsman‟s jurisdiction “matters which are sub-judice before a Court 

of competent jurisdiction etc.” It does not require for the complainant to be a 

party to any proceedings which are sub-judice before a Court of competent 

jurisdiction.  

16. 

It is not disputed that on 15.10.2012, Mr. Aziz had instituted a suit for 

declaration,  permanent  and  mandatory  injunction  against  A.I.O.U.  before 

the  Court  of  the  learned  Civil  Judge,  Islamabad.  In  the  said  suit,  it  was 

pleaded  inter alia  that  A.I.O.U.  had  been  demanding  payment  from  the 

sureties  of  Mr.  Aziz  despite  the  fact  that  his  services  had  not  been 

terminated  (paragraph  20  of  the  suit).  Furthermore,  it  was  pleaded  that 

since A.I.O.U. had failed to pay the full scholarship amount to Mr. Aziz, it was 

estopped from claiming any money or compensation under the terms of the 

surety  bond  (paragraphs  22  and  23  of  the  suit).  It  was  also  pleaded  that 

A.I.O.U.  had  been  asked  by  Mr.  Aziz  to  refrain  from  taking  adverse  action 

against  Mr.  Aziz‟s  sureties  (paragraph  40  of  the  suit).  In  the  said  suit,  Mr. 

Aziz  had  prayed  for  a  declaration  to  the  effect  that  the  surety  bond  dated 

02.08.2000  was  null  and  void  and  inoperative  on  the  rights,  interests  and 

legal status of Mr. Aziz and his sureties.  

17.  A.I.O.U.  had  filed  a  written  statement  in  the  said  suit  on  15.01.2013. 

Perusal  of  the  said  written  statement  shows  that  A.I.O.U.  had  sought 

recovery of Rs.18,52,336.66 against Mr. Aziz by way of set off/counterclaim. 

It  may  be  mentioned  at  this  stage  that  half  of  the  said  amount  i.e. 

Rs.9,26,168.50  has  been  deducted  by  A.I.O.U.  from  respondent  No.2‟s 

pension.  The  other  half  has  been  deducted  from  the  pension  of  the  other 

surety,  who  was  also  an  employee  of  A.I.O.U.  Had  the  said  set  off  been 

allowed by the learned Civil Court, there would have remained no reason for 

A.I.O.U. to withhold the pension of respondent No.2 and the other surety any 

further.  

18.  Respondent  No.2  had  appeared  as  PW.1  in  the  said  suit  and  in  his 

affidavit-in-evidence  filed  on  24.01.2015,  he  had  deposed inter alia  that  he 

had  given  a  surety  that  Mr.  Aziz  would  serve  A.I.O.U.  for  a  period  of  five 

years  and  that  A.I.O.U.  had  deducted  Rs.9,26,168.50  from  respondent 

No.2‟s  pension.  The  trial  in  the  said  suit  culminated  in  the  judgment  and 

 
 
9  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

decree  dated  27.06.2019  whereby  Mr.  Aziz‟s  suit  as  well  as  A.I.O.U.‟s 

counter-claim were dismissed. The finding of the learned Civil Court on the 

issue  pertaining  to  A.I.O.U.‟s  prayer  for  the  recovery  of  Rs.18,52,336.66 

against Mr. Aziz is as follows:- 

“12.  During the course of evidence, the plaintiff produced one Shahid Jamil 
as PW-1, who was one of the guarantor, and he specifically deposed that 
university has already deducted an amount of Rs.926,168 (half of the surety 
amount) from his pension, further, the plaintiff has claimed that entire 
amount of surety has already been deducted by the university from the 
pensions of two sureties, and the university has not rebutted this contention 
of the plaintiff, therefore, they are not entitled to claim the same amount 
again. Resultantly, this issue stands answered in negative.” 

19.  As can be gathered from the learned Civil Court‟s findings referred to 

herein  above  the  testimony  of  respondent  No.2,  who  had  appeared  as  a 

witness  for  Mr.  Aziz,  was  instrumental  in  A.I.O.U.‟s  counterclaim  being 

dismissed.  But  for  respondent  No.2‟s  testimony,  A.I.O.U.‟s  counterclaim 

may not have been defeated.  

20.  The  reason  why  it  was  essential  to  narrate  respondent  No.2‟s  role  in 

the proceedings in the suit instituted  by Mr. Aziz against A.I.O.U. is that  he 

would be deemed to be aware as to the surety bond dated 02.08.2000 to be 

the subject matter of the said suit when he, on 13.03.2020, filed a complaint 

before  the  Ombudsman  against  A.I.O.U.  It  may  also  be  mentioned  that  Mr. 

Aziz has assailed the said judgment and decree dated 27.06.2019 in regular 

first appeal No.220 of 2019 before this Court.  

21. 

It  is  well  settled  that  an  appeal  is  a  continuation  of  proceedings 

instituted  before  the  original  forum.  The  matter  pertaining  to  the  liability  of 

Mr. Aziz as well as that of respondent No.2 under the surety bond was sub-

judice  when  respondent  No.2  filed  a  complaint  on  13.03.2020  before  the 

Ombudsman.  In  the  said  complaint,  respondent  No.2  did  not  make  any 

disclosure  as  to  Mr.  Aziz‟s  liability  under  the  surety  bond  having  been 

adjudicated  upon  and  decided  by  the  learned  Civil  Court.  This  was  a 

material  concealment  by  respondent  No.2.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

Ombudsman‟s  Secretariat  had  submitted  in  unequivocal  terms  that  had 

respondent  No.2  or  even  A.I.O.U.  disclosed  the  factum  as  to  the  judgment 

and decree dated 27.06.2019 having been passed by the learned Civil Court, 

the proceedings pursuant to respondent No.2‟s complaint would have been 

dropped.  True,  the  representatives  of  A.I.O.U.  had been  most  unfair by  not 

 
 
 
10  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

mentioning in the reply to respondent No.2‟s complaint or representation to 

the President of Pakistan the fact about the said judgment and decree or the 

filing  of  the  regular  first  appeal  by  Mr.  Aziz  but  this  non-disclosure  on  the 

part  of  A.I.O.U.  would  not  result  in  vesting  jurisdiction  in  the  Ombudsman 

over  the  matter  which  was  clearly  barred  in  terms  of  proviso  (a)  to  Article 

9(1)  of  the  1983  Order.  Where  a  mandatory  condition  for  the  exercise  of 

jurisdiction  by  a  Court  or  Tribunal  is  not  fulfilled,  the  assumption  of 

jurisdiction  in  such  a  matter  is  liable  to  be  declared  as  without  lawful 

authority. It is also well settled and not open to any dispute that a defect of 

jurisdiction goes to the root of the matter and strikes at the very authority of 

the  Court  or  a  Tribunal  to  pass  an  order  and  this  cannot  be  cured  by  the 

consent  or  waiver  of  the  parties.  In  holding  so,  reliance  is  placed  on  the 

following case law:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Executive  District  Officer,  Schools  and  Literacy  VS 

Qamar Dost Khan (2006 SCMR 1630), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held 

inter alia  that  the  question  of jurisdiction  goes  to  the  root  of  the  case 

and could be raised for the first time even while appearing before the 

highest  Court  of  the  country.  Furthermore,  it  was  held  that  “justice 

according to law is the duty of the Court which can neither be 

abdicated in favour of the whims or ignorance of the litigants or their 

lawyers nor it be avoided or evaded on the pretext that a question of 

law going to the root of the case was not raised promptly.” 

(ii) 

In the case of Mansab Ali VS Amir (PLD 1971 SC 124), it has been held 

as follows:-  

 “It is an elementary principle that if a mandatory condition for the 
exercise of jurisdiction by a Court, tribunal or authority is not fulfilled, 
then the entire proceedings which follow become illegal and suffer 
from want of jurisdiction. Any order passed in continuation of these 
proceedings in appeal or revision equally suffer from illegality and are 
without jurisdiction.”  

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Sadiq  VS  Pakistan,  through  Collector, 

Rawalpindi (1988 CLC 123), it has been held as follows:-  

“Term  'Jurisdiction',  which  refers  to  the  legal  authority  and 
competence of the Court to administer justice, is conferred by law 
only. Jurisdiction can neither be conferred nor ousted by consent. Nor 
submission shall confer jurisdiction on the Court, when it does not 
exist. … It is settled statement of law that decision given without 
jurisdiction is a total nullity.”  

 
 
 
 
 
11  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

22.  Since  neither  respondent  No.2  nor  A.I.O.U.  made  a  disclosure  to  the 

Ombudsman  or  the  President  of  Pakistan  about  the  matter  regarding  Mr. 

Aziz‟s  liability  under  the  surety  bond  having  been  decided  by  the  learned 

Civil  Court,  there  was  no  way  for  the  Ombudsman  or  the  President  of 

Pakistan  to  have  been  aware  of  this  fact.  The  non-disclosure  of  the  said 

material  fact  either  by  respondent  No.2  or  A.I.O.U.  would  not  render 

inoperative the bar contained in proviso (a) to Article 9(1) of the 1983 Order.  

WHETHER  RESPONDENT  NO.2  HAD  FILED  THE  COMPLAINT  BEFORE  THE 
OMBUDSMAN BEYOND THE LIMITATION PERIOD PROVIDED BY LAW:- 

23. 

Insofar  as  the  question  whether  the  complaint  filed  by  respondent 

No.2 before the Ombudsman was barred by limitation is concerned, Article 

10(3)  of  the  1983  Order  provides  that  a  complaint  shall  be  made  not  later 

than three months from the day on which the person aggrieved first had the 

notice of the matter alleged in the complaint but the Mohtasib may conduct 

any  investigation  pursuant  to  a  complaint  which  is  not  within  time  if  he 

considers that there are special circumstances which make it proper for him 

to do so.  

24.  Learned counsel for respondent No.2 tried to justify the delay in filing 

of the complaint by submitting that the committee constituted by A.I.O.U. to 

consider respondent No.2‟s application dated 14.07.2014 for the release of 

his  pension  never  decided  the  said  application  and  this  fact  was  stated  by 

respondent No.2 in his complaint to the Ombudsman. It was also submitted 

that  the  Ombudsman  had  also,  in  his  order  dated  28.08.2020,  recorded 

respondent  No.2‟s  contention  that  such  a  committee  had  not  taken  a 

decision.  

25.  Respondent No.2 had retired from service on 09.06.2014. In A.I.O.U.‟s 

office order dated 03.07.2014 which was also marked to respondent No.2, it 

was  mentioned  that  his  outstanding  dues  were  Rs.9,26,168.50  being  50% 

share of the amount payable by Mr. Aziz under the surety bond. Respondent 

No.2‟s  grievance  against  A.I.O.U.  regarding  the non-payment  of pension to 

him  would  be  deemed  to  have  arisen  in  July,  2014.  It  was  not  until 

13.03.2020  i.e.,  more  than  five  and  a  half  years  later,  that  he  filed  the 

complaint  before  the  Ombudsman.  Even  if  it  is  assumed  that  A.I.O.U.  had 

constituted a committee on respondent No.2‟s application dated 14.07.2014 

 
 
 
 
12  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

and that it did not decide  the said application  this would not be a plausible 

ground  for  ignoring  the  inordinate  delay  in  filing  the  complaint.  I  say  so 

because Article 10(3) of the 1983 Order requires an aggrieved person to file 

a complaint not later than three months from the day on which he “first had 

the notice of the matter alleged in the complaint.”  Since  A.I.O.U.‟s  office 

order  dated  03.07.2014  was  marked  to  respondent  No.2,  and  at  no  stage 

after his retirement on 09.06.2014 did he receive any pension, he would be 

deemed to have had first notice as to non-payment of pension in July, 2014. 

In  these  circumstances,  it  was  obligatory  on  the  Ombudsman  to  have  first 

determined  whether  respondent  No.2  had  filed  his  complaint  within  the 

limitation  period  provided  in  Article  10(3)  of  the  1983  Order  regardless  of 

whether  or  not  A.I.O.U.  had  taken  an  objection  as  to  the  complaint  being 

time  barred.  Failure  on  the  part  of  the  Ombudsman  to  do  so  renders  his 

order  dated  28.08.2020  unsustainable.  In  holding  so,  reliance  is  placed  on 

the following case law:-  

(i) 

Recently,  in  the  case  of  the  Bank  of  Punjab  VS  Messrs  Super  Trunk 

House  (PLD  2022  Lahore  564),  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court  has  held  that  the  question  of  limitation  is  as 

important as jurisdiction of the Court.  

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Khan  Kurd  VS  Arbab  Muhammad  Hashim 

(PLD  2020  Balochistan  38), 

it  was  held  inter  alia  that  “if  the 

proceedings brought before the Court are barred by time, the Court 

cannot assume jurisdiction and shall have no jurisdiction in the matter 

unless the delay is condoned first, and disposal of the suit on merits 

alone is not sufficient for presuming that the delay was condoned.”  

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Nazia  Fazal  VS  Pakistan  International  Airlines 

Corporation (2020 PLC 233), this Court inter alia held as follows:- 

“12.  It is well settled that a Court or a tribunal is bound to notice and 
consider the question of limitation, irrespective of the fact whether or 
not it was agitated by the respondent. The question of limitation could 
not waived, and even if waived could be taken up again by a party 
waiving it, and even by the Court itself. Law to this effect has been laid 
down in the judgments reported as 2007 SCMR 621, 2006 SCMR 170, 
2003 SCMR 1815 and PLD 1985 SC 153.”  

 
 
 
13  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

(iv) 

In the case of Muhammad Iqbal VS Muhammad Ahmed Ramzani (2014 

CLC  1392),  Mr.  Justice  Nadeem  Akhtar  of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of 

Sindh held as follows:- 

“12.  In  the  above  context,  we  would  like  to  observe  that  the 
jurisdiction of a court is always subject to limitation. If the proceedings 
brought before a court is barred by time, the court cannot assume 
jurisdiction and shall have no jurisdiction in the matter, unless the 
delay is condoned first. Till such time, the jurisdiction of the court will 
be restricted only to the extent of deciding the question of limitation. In 
case such question is decided by the court by declining to condone 
the delay, the proceeding shall remain time barred and the matter will 
end there. On the other hand, if the delay is condoned, only then shall 
the court have the jurisdiction to proceed further in the matter. Thus, it 
is mandatory for the court to decide the question of limitation before 
entertaining the matter and before passing any other order therein. 
Since the court shall not have jurisdiction in a time-barred proceeding 
in view of our above observations, all steps taken and orders passed 
in any such time-barred proceeding, and in all proceedings arising 
therefrom, shall be void and without jurisdiction.”  

26.  Although  the  Ombudsman  can  entertain  a  time  barred  complaint  and 

conduct  an  investigation,  the  law  requires  him  to  state  the  “special 

circumstances which make it proper for him to do so.”  The  Ombudsman‟s 

order  dated  28.08.2020  does  not  mention  any  special  circumstance  which 

caused him to entertain respondent No.2‟s time barred complaint.  

27. 

If  this  Court  is  to  accept  the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Ombudsman‟s  Secretariat  that  delay  on  the  part  of  an  agency  in  deciding 

applications  amounts  to  maladministration  and  that  the  Ombudsman 

correctly  assumed  jurisdiction  on  respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  as  A.I.O.U. 

had  left  respondent  No.2‟s  application  dated  14.07.2014  undecided  for  a 

long  time, the Ombudsman should have confined  itself to directing A.I.O.U. 

to decide the said application but could not have taken upon itself to decide 

whether  A.I.O.U.  was  justified  in  withholding  respondent  No.2‟s  pension. 

The  assumption  of  jurisdiction  by  the  Ombudsman  on  respondent  No.2‟s 

time barred claim for the payment of pension was without lawful authority.  

WHETHER THE OMBUDSMAN‟S ORDER DATED 28.08.2020 WAS BASED ON 
MISREADING  AND  NON-READING  OF  THE  DOCUMENTS  /  MATERIAL  ON 
THE RECORD:-  

28.  The Ombudsman, in his revised order, observed that there was neither 

any  provision  in  the  contract  nor  A.I.O.U.  Rules  under  which  a  guarantor 

could  be made to  pay “for the violation committed by the contractee.”  This 

 
 
 
 
 
 
14  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

observation  is  based  on  ignoring  the  surety  bond  altogether  which  has  the 

force of a contract not just between Mr. Aziz (principal debtor) and A.I.O.U. 

(creditor) but also respondent No.2 (guarantor). This finding is also in stark 

contrast  to  the  terms  of  the  surety  bond.  Paragraph  2(a)(vii)  provides  that 

“the  scholar  /  trainee  shall  serve  the  Allama  Iqbal  Open  University, 

Islamabad for a period of five years.” This is one of the conditions on which 

A.I.O.U.  had  awarded  the  scholarship  to  Mr.  Aziz.  One  of  the  covenants  in 

the  said  surety  bond  was  that  in  case  of  breach  of  any  of  the  terms  and 

conditions  of  the  surety  bond,  the  scholar  would  be  bound  to  compensate 

A.I.O.U.  by  making  a refund  of  the total  amount  of expenditure incurred  on 

him  in  foreign  currency  or  Pakistan  rupees.  Additionally,  the  scholar  was 

also obligated to refund the salary / allowances paid during the study period 

as well as the liquidated damages quantified in paragraph b(I) of the surety 

bond.  

29.  Respondent No.2 had guaranteed the payment of any such sum as the 

scholar may be called upon to refund A.I.O.U. “for the breach of any of the 

terms and conditions”  of  the  surety  bond.  The  Ombudsman  by  recording  a 

finding that respondent No.2 as a guarantor could not be made to pay for the 

violation  of  the  terms  of  the  surety  bond  committed  by  the  scholar  has 

clearly misread the terms of the surety bond  and  relieved respondent  No.2 

from  his  contractual  obligations  as  a  guarantor.  This  would  render  the 

Ombudsman‟s order dated 28.08.2020 to be not sustainable.  

30.  The Ombudsman has attached weight to Mr. Aziz‟s return to Pakistan 

and rejoining his duties at A.I.O.U. after obtaining a Ph.D. degree by holding 

that the role  of respondent  No.2 as  a  guarantor  was  over due  to Mr. Aziz‟s 

return. Indeed Mr. Aziz had rejoined his duties in A.I.O.U. and had served for 

31 months before proceeding on ex-Pakistan leave on 13.01.2009 which had 

been sanctioned only for 19 days. But admittedly he did not return to rejoin 

his duties so as to complete five years of service with A.I.O.U. as committed 

by  him  in  the  surety  bond.  Paragraph  2(a)(vii)  of  the  surety  bond  clearly 

provides  that  “the scholar / trainee shall serve the Allama Iqbal Open 

University, Islamabad for a period of five years.”  The  breach  of  the  terms 

mentioned  in  the  surety  bond  bound  Mr.  Aziz  to  compensate  A.I.O.U.  by 

making refund of the total amount of expenditure incurred on him in foreign 

 
 
15  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

currency or Pakistan rupees. Additionally, Mr. Aziz was also bound to refund 

the  salary  /  allowances  paid  to  him  during  the  study  period  as  well  as 

liquidated  damages.  These  liquidated  damages  are  also  quantified  in  the 

surety  bond.  Respondent  No.2  and  Iqbal  Hussain  stood  as  guarantors  for 

the fulfillment of all of Mr. Aziz‟s obligations under the surety bond, including 

Mr.  Aziz‟s  commitment  to  serve  A.I.O.U.  for  a  period  of  five  years  after  his 

return to  Pakistan.  The Ombudsman‟s decision that respondent No.2‟s role 

as a guarantor was long over upon Mr. Aziz‟s service for 31 months after his 

return to Pakistan is a result of clear non-reading or misreading of the surety 

bond and in particular Paragraph 2(a)(vii) thereof read with respondent No.2 

guaranteeing the fulfilment of Mr. Aziz‟s obligations thereunder.  

31. 

Indeed,  Mr.  Aziz  had  proceeded  on  ex-Pakistan  leave  for  a  specified 

period but the grant of such leave in the exigency of service also did not put 

an  end  to  Mr.  Aziz‟s  obligation  to  complete  five  years  of  service  with 

A.I.O.U.,  which  would  include  the  period  when  he  was  on  sanctioned  ex-

Pakistan  leave.  The  obligation  of  respondent  No.2  as  a  guarantor  was  not 

just  restricted  to  ensuring  Mr.  Aziz‟s  return  to  Pakistan  after  obtaining  the 

Ph.D.  degree  but  also  to  complete  five  years  of  service  after  his  return  to 

Pakistan.  

32. 

I  do  not  find  force  in  the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.2  that  A.I.O.U.  should  have  instituted  proceedings  against 

Mr.  Aziz  for  the  recovery  of  the  amount  due  to  A.I.O.U.  under  the  surety 

bond  and  it  is  only  after  Mr.  Aziz‟s  failure  to  pay  A.I.O.U.  the  amount 

adjudged to be due to the latter could respondent No.2 be required to make 

payment  of  such  amount  as  a  guarantor.  It  is  well  settled  that  any 

forbearance on the part of a creditor to sue the principal debtor or enforce 

any  remedy  against  him  does  not  discharge  the  surety.  Reference  in  this 

regard  may  be  made  to  the  law  laid  down  in  the  case  of  Central  Exchange 

Bank  Ltd.  VS  Zaitoon  Begum  (PLD  1968  S.C.  83).  In  the  case  at  hand, 

A.I.O.U.  did,  vide  letter  dated  26.07.2010,  call  upon  Mr.  Aziz  to  pay 

Rs.18,52,336.66.  Perusal  of  the  said  letter  shows  that  the  gross  amount  of 

Rs.23,76,650.66 was determined by A.I.OU to be payable by Mr. Aziz under 

the following heads:-

33.  The  amount  which  was  due  to  be  paid  by  A.I.O.U.  to  Mr.  Aziz  for  his 

service was determined  to be Rs.5,24,314/-. The adjustment of this amount 

with  the  amount  that  had  been  determined  as  payable  by  Mr.  Aziz  caused 

the  net  amount  recoverable  from  Mr.  Aziz  to  be  Rs.18,52,336.66.  A.I.O.U. 

wants each of the two guarantors to pay half of the said amount. In this way, 

the  liability  of  respondent  No.2  as  a  guarantor  has  been  determined  as 

Rs.9,26,168.50.  

34. 

It is well settled that the liability of a guarantor depends on the terms 

and language of the guarantee and that the guarantor cannot be made liable 

for an amount beyond the terms of the guarantee. Reference in this regard 

may  be  made  to  the  law  laid  down  in  the  case  reported  as  United  Bank 

Limited VS Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation Ltd. (PLD 

2002 S.C. 1100). The liability that Mr. Aziz was to discharge for the breach of 

any  of  the  terms  and  conditions  set  out  in  the  surety  bond  is  mentioned  in 

paragraph  2(b)  thereof.  For  such  breach,  Mr.  Aziz‟s  liability  was  to 

compensate A.I.O.U. “by making a refund of the total amount of expenditure 

incurred  on  him/her  in  the  foreign  currency  or  Pakistan  rupees.” 

Additionally,  Mr.  Aziz  was  obligated  to  pay  the  salary  /  allowances  paid  to 

him  during  the  study  leave  as  well  as  the  liquidated  damages  quantified  in 

the surety bond. Under Section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872, the liability of 

a guarantor is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor but by no means 

can  the  guarantor  be  made  to  pay  for  the  principal  debtor‟s  liability  which 

does  not  arise  from  the  contract  of  guarantee.  The  word “co-extensive”  in 

Section 128 of the Contract Act, 1872 denotes the extent of liability and can 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
17  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

relate  only  to  the  quantum  of  the  principal  debt.  The  guarantor  is  liable  to 

the  creditor  for  the  principal  debtor‟s  liability  under  an  agreement  or 

instrument  referred  to  in  the  contract  of  guarantee.  In  the  instant  case, 

respondent  No.2‟s  liability  as  a  guarantor  is  for  Mr.  Aziz‟s  liabilities  under 

the  surety  bond  and  none  other.  Respondent  No.2  did  not  guarantee  the 

payment of Mr. Aziz‟s dues to A.I.O.U. under the terms and conditions of his 

service dehors the terms and conditions of the surety bond. For instance, in 

the  instant  case,  A.I.O.U.  in  determining  the  gross  amount  payable  by  Mr. 

Aziz has included Rs.1,23,341/- as house building advance; Rs.2,58,808/- as 

payment  made  to  Mr.  Aziz  between  01.02.2009  to  31.05.2009  when  he 

proceeded  abroad  on  ex-Pakistan  leave;  Rs.71,198/-  as  amount  paid  on 

account  of  „first class first increments;‟  and  Rs.88,140/-  as  three  months‟ 

pay in lieu of notice period. Respondent No.2 could not be made liable to pay 

these  amounts  to  A.I.O.U.  since  Mr.  Aziz‟s  liability  to  pay  the  said  amounts 

does  not  arise  from  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  surety  bond.  It  is, 

however, an admitted position that at no stage did Mr. Aziz re-pay to A.I.O.U. 

the  amount  spent  by  the  latter  on  his  studies  abroad  or  the  liquidated 

damages  quantified  in  the  surety  bond.  In  these  circumstances,  A.I.O.U. 

could  not  have  been  held  by  the  Ombudsman  to  have  committed 

maladministration in terms of Article 2(2)(i) of the 1983 Order for enforcing 

its  rights  against  the  guarantor  /  respondent  No.2  under  the  terms  of  the 

guarantee  embodied  in  the  surety  bond.  By  not  appreciating  the  import  of 

Paragraph 2(a)(vii) of the surety bond  coupled with the fact that respondent 

No.2 had stood as guarantor to compensate A.I.O.U. for Mr. Aziz‟s breach of 

commitment to service A.I.O.U. for five years, the Ombudsman misread the 

material  on  the  record,  which  justifies  interference  with  the  order  dated 

28.08.2020. In the case of Mst. Farhat Jabeen VS Muhammad Safdar (2011 

SCMR 1073), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that interference by the High 

Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution with 

an  order  passed  by  the  Family  Court  is  to  be  restricted  to  cases  of 

misreading and non-reading of material evidence which  has bearing on the 

fate of the case. Additionally, in the case of Nazir Begum VS Qamarunnissa 

(1982  CLC  2271),  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  has  held  that  the  term 

 
 
18  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

„misreading‟ means holding non-existence of evidence when such evidence 

exists. 

35.  Where  the relationship between the complainant and the “agency” as 

defined  in  Article  2(1)  of  the  1983  Order  is  of  a  contractual  nature,  and 

where  the  act  or  omission  on  the  part  of  the  agency  with  respect  to  which 

the  complaint  is  filed  is  offensive  to  any  law,  rules  or  regulations,  the 

Ombudsman  would  have  jurisdiction  in  the  matter  on  the  basis  of  the 

abovementioned dictum. In the case  of  Capital Development Authority VS 

Zahid Iqbal (PLD 2004 SC 99), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-  

“No provision either of the said President's Order No.1 of 1983 or of any 
other law for the time being in force took a matter out of the jurisdiction of 
the Mohtasib only because the same related to a contractual obligation. If 
as a result of the investigation conducted by the Mohtasib he came to the 
conclusion that the complained act was offensive of any law, rules or 
regulations then the Ombudsman was well within his powers to deal with 
the said matter in accordance with the provisions of the said Order 1 of 
1983. The action of the President in setting aside the findings and 
recommendations of the Mohtasib only because the matter related to a 
contractual dispute was thus no reason or ground justifying interference 
with the findings and the recommendations of the Ombudsman.” 

36.  However,  while  exercising  jurisdiction  under  no  circumstances  can 

the  Ombudsman  rewrite  the  contract  between  the  complainant  and  the 

agency  or  ignore  any  of  its  terms  and  conditions.  In  the  case  at  hand,  the 

Ombudsman  has  termed  A.I.O.U.‟s  action  of  withholding  Rs.9,26,168.50 

from  respondent  No.2‟s  pension  as  an  act  of  maladministration  when 

A.I.O.U.  by  doing  so  acted  to  recover  Mr.  Aziz‟s  liability  under  the  surety 

bond which liability was co-extensive with that of respondent No.2 under the 

terms of the guarantee. The Ombudsman has not referred to any  law, rules 

or regulations which were violated by this act of A.I.O.U in doing so.  

37.  Regulation 23(1)(q) of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Investigation and Disposal 

of Complaints) Regulations, 2013  (“the 2013 Regulations”)provides that the 

investigation  of  a  complaint  shall,  with  the  approval  of  the  Mohtasib,  be 

closed when it is found that the complaint involves examination of witnesses, 

detailed  interpretation  of  laws,  rules,  regulations  or  different  clauses  of 

contracts  and  their  inter se  relationship  for  which  the  proper  forum  is  a 

Court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  not  the  office  of  the  Ombudsman.  In 

other words, a complaint that involves the interpretation of law or clauses of 

a contract ought to be left to be decided by a Court of plenary jurisdiction. In 

 
 
 
19  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

this  case,  the  complaint  involved  the  interpretation  of  Section  128  of  the 

Contract  Act,  1872  which  made  respondent  No.2‟s  liability  under  the 

contract  of guarantee to  be co-extensive  with  the liability  of Mr. Aziz under 

the  terms  of  the  surety  bond.  It  also  involved  the  interpretation  of  clause 

2(a)(vii)  of  the  surety  bond  which  obligated  Mr.  Aziz  to  serve  A.I.O.U.  for  a 

period of five years after his return to Pakistan. It was for the Ombudsman to 

have been cognizant of the requirements of Regulation 23(1)(q) of the 2013 

Regulations  before  exercising  jurisdiction  in  the  matter  and  returning  a 

finding of maladministration against A.I.O.U. 

38. 

It is not disputed that respondent No.2 and Iqbal Hussain volunteered 

to  be  guarantors  for  the  fulfillment  of  all  the  contractual  obligations  of  Mr. 

Aziz under the surety bond. Before a person volunteers to be a guarantor he 

is expected to appreciate and understand the nature of all the obligations of 

the  principal  debtor  under  the  underlying  contract.  A  guarantor  cannot  be 

absolved  from  his  liability,  which  is  co-extensive  with  the  principal  debtor, 

merely because such liability is financially burdensome. In the instant case, 

respondent No.2 knew or ought to have known that if Mr. Aziz breached his 

obligation under paragraph 2(a)(vii) of the surety bond to serve A.I.O.U. for a 

period of five years after his return to Pakistan, Mr. Aziz would be bound to 

compensate A.I.O.U. by making a refund of the total amount of expenditure 

incurred on him in the foreign currency or Pakistan rupees in addition to the 

payment of salary  /  allowances  paid  during  the study  period  and  liquidated 

damages quantified in the said surety bond. In the event of a default on Mr. 

Aziz‟s part to pay A.I.O.U., respondent No.2‟s liability under the guarantee is 

triggered.  Furthermore,  if  Mr.  Aziz  discharges  or  partially  discharges  his 

financial  liability  under  the  surety  bond  to  A.I.O.U.,  respondent  No.2‟s 

liability as  a guarantor would be extinguished  or scaled down pro tanto, as 

the case may be.  

39. 

I  am  conscious  that  the  impugned  order  dated  28.08.2020  of  the 

Ombudsman  and  the  order  dated  10.12.2020  of  the  President  of  Pakistan 

are concurrent in nature. Mere concurrency in the findings recorded by the 

original  and  the  appellate  fora  would  not  make  such  findings  absolutely 

immune  from  interference  by  the  High  Court  in  exercise  of  the  writ 

jurisdiction.  What  if  the  original  and  the  appellate  fora  have  concurrently 

 
 
20  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

non-read  or  misread  the  evidence  or  have  erroneously  assumed  certain 

facts or have misapplied the law or acted in excess of abuse of jurisdiction? 

Ordinarily,  the  High  Court,  in  exercise  of  its  writ  jurisdiction,  cannot 

interfere  with  the  finding  of  fact  recorded  by  a  Court  or  a  Tribunal.  But 

where the view taken by such Court or Tribunal was not only contrary to the 

established  principles  of  law  but  also  to  the  evidence  on  record,  the  High 

Court,  in  exercise  of  writ  jurisdiction,  was  competent  and  justified  to 

interfere  with  the  order  under  challenge.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  be 

made  to  the  judgment  in  the  case  of  Lal  Din  Masih  VS  Sakina  Jan  (1985 

SCMR  1972).  Indeed  in  such  circumstances  concurrent  findings  of  fact 

would not be sacrosanct, and a writ Court would be obligated to interfere in 

the same.  

WHETHER  THE  PROVISIONS  OF  THE  PENSIONS  ACT,  1871  BARRED 
A.I.O.U.  FROM  MAKING  DEDUCTIONS  FROM  RESPONDENT  NO.2‟S 
PENSION:- 

40.  The  President  of  Pakistan,  while 

turning  down  A.I.O.U.‟s 

representation against the Ombudsman‟s order dated 28.08.2020, held inter 

alia that the Pensions Act, 1871 envisages that no pension shall be liable to 

seizure, attachment or sequestration. Section 11 of the said Act reads thus:-  

“No  pension  granted  or  continued  by  Government  on  political 
considerations, or on account of past services or present infirmities or as a 
compassionate allowance, and no money due or to become due on account 
of such pension or allowance, shall be liable to seizure, attachment or 
sequestration by process of any Court in Pakistan, at the instance of a 
creditor, for any demand against the pensioner, or in satisfaction of a decree 
or order of any such Court.” 

41.  The  provisions  of  the  Pensions  Act,  1871  indicate  that  they  are 

applicable  to  pensions  and  grants  made by  the  Federal  Government  or the 

Provincial  Governments  as  the  case  may  be.  Section  3A  of  the  said  Act 

provides  that  the  expression  “the appropriate Government”  means,  in 

relation to federal pensions, the Federal Government and in relation to other 

pensions, the Provincial Government. I am of the view that the provisions of 

Section 11 of the Pensions  Act,  1871 would  not be attracted  in  the  present 

case  for  the  reason  that  respondent  No.2  was  due  to  be  paid  his  pension 

from  his  employer  which is  a  university  constituted  under  the  provisions  of 

the Allama Iqbal Open University Act, 1974.  A.I.O.U., being the creature of a 

statute, has the status of an autonomous body and cannot be termed as the 

 
 
 
 
21  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

Federal  Government  or  Provincial  Government.  Thus,  the  President  of 

Pakistan erred by relying on Section 11 of the Pensions Act, 1871 for holding 

that respondent No.2‟s pension could not be withheld.  

42.  Statute 33 of the Allama Iqbal Open University (General Conditions of 

Service)  Statutes,  1978  (“1978  Statutes”)  provides  that  the  Civil  Service 

Regulations  relating  to  pension  and  retirement  benefits  as  applicable  to 

federal  government  servants  shall  apply  to  employees  of  A.I.O.U.  There  is 

no  provision  in  the  Civil  Service  Regulations  which  bars  the  Government 

from  withholding  a  retired  employee‟s  pension  as  adjustment  of  the 

employee‟s financial liability to the Government. On the contrary, Regulation 

351-B  of  the  Civil  Service  Regulations  provides  that  the  Government  may, 

within  one  year  from  the  date  of  issuance  of  Pension  Payment  Order, 

recover any of its dues from the pension granted to a civil servant subject to 

the  condition  that  no  recovery  shall  be  made  from  the  pension  without  the 

personal  order  of  the  head  of  the  Ministry  or  Division  or  head  of  the 

Department,  declared  as  such  under  S.R.2(10)  and  included  in  Appendix 

No.14,  Vol. 

II  of 

the  Compilation  of 

the  Fundamental  Rules  and 

Supplementary Rules, as the case may be. In the case at hand, the President 

of  Pakistan  appears  to  have  made  no  attempt  to  ascertain  whether  the 

decision  to  withhold  respondent  No.2‟s  pension  had  been  made  with  the 

personal order of the Head of the Department in A.I.O.U. where respondent 

No.2 had served.  

SCOPE  OF  THE  OMBUDSMAN‟S  POWER  OF  REVIEW  UNDER  SECTION  13 
OF THE FEDERAL OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS ACT, 2013:- 

43. 

It  is  by  now  well  established  that  a  Court  or  a quasi-judicial  authority 

cannot  review  its  own  order  unless  the  power  of  review  is  expressly 

conferred on it by the statute under which it derives its jurisdiction. Section 

13(1) of the Federal Ombudsman Institutional Reforms Act, 2013 (“the 2013 

Act”) empowers the Ombudsman to review any findings, recommendations, 

orders or decisions on a review petition made by an aggrieved party within 

thirty  days  of  the  findings,  recommendations,  orders  or  decisions  whereas 

Section  13(3)  provides  that  in  review,  the  Ombudsman  may  alter,  modify, 

amend or recall the recommendation, order or decision. Section 24(1) of the 

2013 Act gives  an  overriding  effect  to the  provisions  of  the said  Act  to any 

 
 
 
22  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

other law for the time being in force whereas Section 24(2) provides that in 

case  there  is  a  conflict  between  the  provisions  of  the  2013  Act  and  the 

“relevant legislation”  (which  is  defined  in  Section  2(c)  of  the  2013  Act  to 

include  the  1983  Order),  the  provisions  of  the  2013  Act,  to  the  extent  of 

inconsistency, shall prevail. 

44.  Unlike  Order  XLVII,  Rule  1  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908 

(“C.P.C.”),  the  language  of  Section  13(1)  of  the  2013  Act  does  not  restrict 

the Ombudsman‟s power of review to cases where (i) there is a discovery of 

a  new  and  important  matter  or  evidence  which  after  the  exercise  of  due 

diligence  was  not  within  the  knowledge  of  the  applicant  or  could  not  have 

been produced by him at the time when the order was passed, or (ii) there is 

some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or (iii) there is any 

other  sufficient  reason.  Even  though  the  power  of  review  conferred  on  the 

Ombudsman under Section 13(1) of the 2013 Act does not carry the fetters 

envisaged by Order XLVII, Rule 1 C.P.C., the Ombudsman cannot be said to 

have unbridled power to come to a totally different conclusion from the one 

taken  earlier  on  the  basis  of  the  very  same  material  and  facts  that  were 

placed  before  him  earlier.  The  Ombudsman‟s  discretion  to  exercise  its 

power  of  review  conferred  by  Section  13(1)  of  the  2013  Act  can  be 

structured 

if  he  was  to  exercise  that  power  only 

in  cases  where 

requirements contained in Order XLVII, Rule 1 C.P.C. are satisfied. I say so 

on the basis of the law laid down in the following cases:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Sahib  Rai  VS  Custodian  of  Evacuee  Property,  Karachi 

(PLD  1957  SC  63),  an  application  was  filed  for  review  of  the  order 

passed by the Custodian of Evacuee Property confirming the order of 

the Assistant Custodian.  The  said  application was  filed  under  Section 

36(5) of the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) Ordinance, 

1949, which provided that the Custodian or Additional Custodian may, 

within  the  prescribed  period,  and  after  giving  notice  to  the  parties 

concerned and the Rehabilitation Authority, review his own order. One 

of  the  questions  that  arose  for  consideration  in  the  said  case  was 

whether a review of the Custodian‟s original order was justified on the 

basis  of  evidence  which  constituted  new  and  important  matter 

relevant  to  the  case,  and  which  was  not  available  to the Custodian  at 

 
 
23  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

the  time  when  he  passed  the  original  order.  The  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice 

A.R.  Cornelius  (as  he  then  was)  agreed  with  the  submission  made  by 

Mr.  Khalid  Ishaq,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  in  the  said 

case, that although the Pakistan (Administration of Evacuee Property) 

Ordinance,  1949  did  not  state  in  detail  the  circumstances  in  which  a 

review of an order by the Custodian or Additional Custodian should be 

permissible, recourse could be had to the general law for ascertaining 

the  principles  governing  the  exercise  of  this  power  in  the  relevant 

respect.  For  the  purposes  of  clarity,  the  relevant  portion  of  the  said 

judgment is reproduced herein below:- 

“By section 114 power is given to aggrieved persons to apply for a 
review of judgment, and in rule 1 of Order XLVII, the Code sets out in 
detail  the  circumstances  in  which  such  an  application  shall  be 
competent. One of these circumstances is “the discovery of new and 
important  matter  or  evidence  which,  after  the  exercise  of  due 
diligence, was not within (his) knowledge or could not be produced (by 
him) at the time when the decree was passed.” Clearly, in order to 
meet the case covered by this provision, an elastic rule of limitation 
was necessary, and section 5 of the Limitation Act expressly provides 
such elasticity. 
It is evident that in the present case, the application filed in 1955 by 
the  evacuee  brothers  and  the  evidence  which  they  produced 
constituted new and important matter relevant to the case, and 
furnished evidence which was not available to the Custodian at the 
time when the first orders were made in the case, including the order 
of the 10th May 1951. Mr. Khalid Ishaq in the course of his argument, 
very rightly admitted that although the Ordinance did not state in 
detail  the  circumstances  in  which  a  review  of  an  order  by  the 
Custodian or Additional Custodian should be permissible, recourse 
could be had to the general law for ascertaining the principles 
governing the exercise of this power in the relevant respect.” 
(Emphasis added)  

(ii)  The  scope  of  review  under  the  proviso  to  Section  14(2)  of  the 

Emigration  Ordinance,  1979  came  up  for  consideration  before  the 

Hon'ble Lahore High Court in the case of Al-Qamar Recruiting Agency 

VS  Government  of  Pakistan  (1989  MLD  3335).  The  proviso  to  Section 

14(1)  of  the  said  Ordinance  gave  a  right  of  appeal  to  the  Federal 

Government  from  an  order  passed  by  the  Director  General  or  any 

other  officer  in  exercise  of  the  power  delegated  to  him.  The  said 

proviso  also  provided  that  the  decision  of  the  Federal  Government 

shall,  subject  to  Section  14(2),  be  final.  Section  14(2)  provided  that 

“the Federal Government may review its decision under sub-section 

 
 
 
 
  
24  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

(1) and the decision of the Federal Government in review shall be 

final.”  The  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  agreed  with  the  submission 

made  by  Mr.  S.M.  Zafar  that  the  provisions  in  Section  14(2)  of  the 

Emigration Ordinance, 1979 must be construed in the same manner as 

an  ordinary  power  of  review  hemmed  by  the  principles  laid  down  in 

Order  XLVII,  Rule  1  C.P.C.  The  Hon'ble  High  Court  held  that  the 

Federal  Government,  in  exercise  of  its  powers  under  Section  14(2) 

ibid,  cannot  reopen  the  whole  matter  and  that  the  power  of  review  is 

confined to discover errors apparent on the face of the record. 

45.  On the basis of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 

case of Sahib Rai  VS Custodian  of Evacuee Property,  Karachi (supra), and 

Al-Qamar Recruiting Agency VS Government of Pakistan (supra) it must be 

held  that  the  Ombudsman  can  exercise  his  power  of  review  under  Section 

13(1)  of  the  2013  Act  if  the  conditions  enumerated  in  Order  XLVII,  Rule  1 

C.P.C. are satisfied. 

46. 

In the case at hand, the Ombudsman had, vide his earlier order dated 

17.06.2020,  closed  the  investigation  in  respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  by 

specifically  referring  to  Regulation  23(1)(b)  of  the  2013  Regulations,  which 

provides that the investigation of a complaint shall, with the approval of the 

Mohtasib,  be  closed  when  it  is  found  that  the  agency  is  not  at  fault  as  a 

particular  procedure  was  to  be  adopted  or  formalities  were  to  be  followed 

by  the  complainant  for  redressal  of  his  grievances.  Respondent  No.2  had 

filed an application for review of the said order dated 17.06.2020. Although, 

the Ombudsman, in his subsequent order dated 28.08.2020, has referred to 

the  fact  that  the  earlier  investigation  in  respondent  No.2‟s  complaint  had 

been closed but  has not given reasons as to why  based on the same set  of 

facts  and  documents  he  feels  obliged  to  come  to  a  conclusion  contrary  to 

the one taken earlier. What the Ombudsman in fact did is to rehear the case 

in review jurisdiction and came to the conclusion that A.I.O.U. had indulged 

in maladministration. The gentleman holding the position of the Ombudsman 

on both the occasions was the same.  

47.  The  power  of  review  was  indeed  available  to  the  Ombudsman  but  it 

was not to be exercised in order to give the complainant another shot at the 

case. In the case of Muhammad Khan VS Government of West Pakistan (PLD 

 
 
25  

   W.P.No.1086/2021 

1971 Baghdad-ul-Jadid 53), the Hon'ble Mr. Justice Anwarul Haq (as he then 

was)  held  that  the  power  of  review  is  not  intended  to  enable  a  Court  to 

reverse its previous judgment on the basis of a maturer appreciation of the 

arguments  previously  presented,  or  by  reason  of  additional  arguments 

which  were  previously  omitted  from  being  advanced  by  the  party 

concerned,  and  such  omission  was  not  on  account  of  any  reasons 

mentioned in Order XLVII, Rule 1 C.P.C. In the case of Sh. Mehdi Hassan VS 

Province  of  Punjab  (2007  SCMR  755),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  held  as 

follows:-  

“This is settled law that the points already raised and considered before the 
Court, cannot be re-agitated in review jurisdiction which is confined to the 
extent of patent error or a mistake floating on the face of record which if not 
corrected may perpetuate illegality and injustice. The mere fact that another 
view of the matter was possible or the conclusion drawn in the judgment was 
wrong, would not be a valid ground to review the judgment unless it is shown 
that the Court has failed to consider an important question of law.”  

48.  One of the grounds taken by respondent No.2 in his review application 

was  that  on  account  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  he  could  not  attend  the 

hearing  on  04.04.2020  which  resulted  in  the  order  for  the  closure  of  the 

investigation.  It  is  not  disputed  that  in  April,  2020  there  was  a  surge  of  the 

COVID-19 pandemic but this ground cannot be read into  the Ombudsman‟s 

order  dated  28.08.2020  when  the  said  order  is  silent  as  to  the  reasons  for 

reviewing his earlier order dated 17.06.2020.   

49. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  petition  is  allowed;  impugned  order 

dated 28.08.2020 of the Ombudsman and the order dated 10.12.2020 of the 

President  of  Pakistan  are  set-aside;  and  the  matter  is  remanded  to  the 

Ombudsman  for  a decision afresh  on  respondent No.2‟s  review  application 

strictly in accordance with the law. There shall be no order as to costs.
