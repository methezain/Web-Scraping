Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel where necessary.  

10.11.2022  Nemo. 

Despite  service  of  notice  pervi  upon 

the 

petitioner and his counsel, none appeared on behalf of 

the petitioner today. The same was the position on the 

last  two  dates  of  hearing.  It  seems  that  the  petitioner 

has  lost  interest  in  the  instant  matter;  therefore,  the 

instant writ petition is dismissed for non-prosecution.
