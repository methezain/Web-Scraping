VS

Mst. Sadia Safdar and others. 

S.No. of 
order/ 
proceeding 
(04) 

Order with signature of Judge and that 
of parties or counsel where necessary. 

Date of 
order/ 
proceeding 
21.10.2021  Ch. Muhammad Asad Raan, Advocate for the 

petitioner.  
Mr. Imtiaz Haider, Advocate for respondent. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed 

under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 

Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed  the  legality  and  validity  of  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated  10.12.2019, 

passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court-

West,  Islamabad    as  well  as  Judgment  and 

decree  dated  07.12.2020,  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District 

Judge,  West-

Islamabad.  

02. 

Succinctly stated, the facts mentioned in 

the writ petition are that the respondent No.1 / 

plaintiff  filed  suit  for  recovery  of  dower 

amount,  maintenance  and  dowry  articles  on 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

08.07.2017. During the proceedings before the 

learned  trial  Court,  the  petitioner  /  defendant 

challenged the territorial jurisdiction of learned 

trial Court.  

03.  Out  of  divergent  pleadings  of 

the 

parties,  the  issues  were  framed;  evidence  of 

both the parties was recorded and the learned 

Judge  Family  Court  decreed  the  suit  of 

respondent  No.1  /  plaintiff  on  10.12.2019, 

whereby relief was granted to respondent No.1 

/  plaintiff 

that 

she  was  entitled 

for 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

25,000/-  per  month  for  three  months  of  her 

iddat period; she was also entitled for recovery 

of  dowry  articles  as  per  list  exhibited  during 

the  evidence  or  in  alternate  payment  of       

Rs.  4,00,000/-  from  the  defendant.  Further, 

she was entitled for recovery of dower amount 

Rs. 5000/- from the petitioner/defendant.  

04. 

Petitioner  challenged 

the 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated  10.12.2019,  by 

filing  an  appeal  before  the  learned  Additional 

District Judge, West-Islamabad which was also 

 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

dismissed vide impugned judgment and decree 

dated 07.12.2020. 

05. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

contended  that  the  impugned  judgment  and 

decree has only been challenged to the extent 

of relief, whereby the respondent No.1/plaintiff 

was  declared  entitled 

for  maintenance 

allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  25,000/-  per 

month for three months of her iddat period.  

06. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia,  contends 

that  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments and decrees are illegal, against the 

law  and  not  maintainable;  both  the  learned 

Courts below did not apply their judicious mind 

and  passed  the  impugned  judgments  on  the 

basis of surmises and conjectures. 

07.  A  clear  objection  was  taken  by  the 

petitioner  /  defendant  that  respondent  No.1  / 

plaintiff was not resident of Islamabad, hence, 

learned Judge Family Court could not entertain 

the  suit  in  accordance  with  law  and  both  the 

impugned judgments and decrees are liable to 

be set aside.   

 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

08. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent 

No.1  has 

controverted 

the 

arguments 

advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner 

and  has  stated  that  both  the  judgments  and 

decrees  have 

rightly  been  passed 

in 

accordance with the dictums laid down by the 

Superior  Courts  of 

the  country; 

in  writ 

jurisdiction  this  Court  cannot  evaluate  the 

evidence recorded by the learned Judge Family 

Court  and  has  prayed  for  dismissal  of  instant 

writ petition.  

09.  Arguments heard, record perused.  

10. 

The  main  emphasis  of  the  petitioner  is 

on  the  point  that  jurisdiction  of  learned  trial 

Court  was  challenged  on  the  ground  that 

respondent  No.1  was  not 

resident  of 

Islamabad, hence suit filed in the learned trial 

Court  was  not  maintainable.  In  this  regard 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  has  framed  issue 

No.4  and  while  deciding  the  suit,  it  has 

categorically mentioned in the issue that father 

of respondent No.1/plaintiff is an employee of 

Islamabad  police  service  since  decade  and  is 

residing  in  Islamabad;  respondent  No.1  / 

 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

plaintiff  being  non-working  woman  was 

residing  with  her  father  and  the  petitioner  / 

defendant was failed to produce any legal and 

cogent evidence in support of his contention.  

11.  On  the  merits,  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  has  made  no  arguments  that  how 

respondent  No.1  /  plaintiff  is  not  entitle  for 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

25,000/-  per  month  for  three  months  of  her 

iddat period.   

12. 

Further, there are concurrent findings of 

both  the  learned  Courts  below  against  the 

petitioner. In case of concurrent findings of the 

courts  below,  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner 

has failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading of the evidence. It has been laid down 

in  a  case  titled  as  “Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS 

Abdul Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others” 

(2008 YLR 2309)” that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

 
 
 
      
 
6 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

interfered when  the  orders  of 

the Courts below are fanciful or 

based  on  misreading  or  non-

reading  of  the  evidence".  The 

same  view  has  also  been  taken  in  a 

case 

titled  as  “Sadruddin  VS 

Aslam  Madad  Ali  and  others” 

(PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

13. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is  only 

available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of 

law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for  correcting 

errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court 

or  a  tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise 

its  jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts 

illegally 

in  exercise  of 

its 

undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice. The High Court while issuing a writ of 

certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of  supervisory  and 

not  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in 

exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not review 

the  findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal. Reliance may be made to 

the following case laws:  

 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan VS Muhammad Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle of law that the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the  discretion  exercised 

by lower courts unless the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has been passed without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of evidence, or is not in 

accordance with the law. 

If none of these errors is 

present, the High Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

a different conclusion as 

to  the  controversy  than 

the latter. In this regard, 

reference can be made to 

a  collective  reading  of 

Mst.  Mobin  Fatima  v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad  (1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"President  All  Pakistan 

Women 

Association, 

Peshawar 

Cantt 

VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and 

others” (2020 SCMR 260),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It  is  settled  law  that 

when the Statute does not 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

same 

cannot 

be 

challenged  by  invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction  of  the  High 

Court in order to gain a 

similar objective. Where a 

Statute  has  expressly 

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

barred a remedy which is 

not  available  to  a  party 

under  the  Statute,  it 

cannot 

be 

sought 

indirectly by resort to the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of  the  High  Court.  The 

High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

advancing  the  policy  of 

law  and  delivering 

expeditious  justice  in 

accordance with the law 

and the Constitution. Even 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and  discretionary 

in 

nature and should not be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass the purpose of a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

 
 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

"Where the Court or the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such 

determination 

cannot  ordinarily  be 

interfered  with  by  the 

High 

Court  while 

exercising 

jurisdiction 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution."  

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate  court  / 

 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

Tribunal in a fair and just 

manner without violating 

or  disregarding  statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned  Judges  of  the 

High  Court  for  future 

course of action:  

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz 

Ahmed  v.  Government 

of  Pakistan,  through 

Secretary, 

Interior 

Division, 

Islamabad 

(1994 SCMR 2142). 

(ii)  Shahnaz Begum v. 

The Hon’ble Judges of 

the High Court of Sindh 

and  Balochistan  (PLD 

1971 SC 677). 

(iii)  Malik Shaukat Ali 

Dogar v. Ghulam Qasim 

Khan  Khakwani  (PLD 

1994 SC 281).  

 (v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam  VS  Muhammad 

 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 

2007 SC 45),  it  is  held  by  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The  High  Court  in 

exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

is  not  supposed  to 

interfere  in  the  findings 

on  the  controversial 

question of facts based on 

evidence  even  if  such 

finding is erroneous. The 

scope  of  the  judicial 

review of the High Court 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution in such cases, 

is limited to the extent of 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence  or  if  the 

finding  is  based  on  no 

evidence which may cause 

miscarriage of justice but 

it  is  not  proper  for  the 

High Court to disturb the 

finding  of  fact  through 

reappraisal of evidence in 

writ 

jurisdiction  or 

exercise  this  jurisdiction 

as a substitute of revision 

or appeal”. 

14. 

For what has been discussed above, the 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

 
 
 
13 

Writ Petition No.614 of 2021 

10.12.2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court-West,  Islamabad  as  well  as 

Judgment  and  decree  dated  07.12.2020, 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge, West-Islamabad are in accordance with 

law and facts of the matter and do not require 

interference  by  this  Court.  The  writ  petition  is 

not  maintainable,  hence  dismissed  being 

meritless with no order as to costs.
