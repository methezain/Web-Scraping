necessa  . 
Mr.  Muhammad  Rizwan  Ahmad,  Advocate 
for the  petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed 

under Article  199  of the  Constitution  of  Islamic 

Republic of  Pakistan, 1973,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed 

judgments 

and  decrees  dated 

13.12.2021 and 27.09.2021, passed  by learned 

Additional  District  Judge 

(MCAC),  West- 

Islamabad  and  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III 

(Judge  Family  Court),  West-Islamabad, 

respectively,  to  the  extent  of  modification  of 

monthly  maintenance  awarded  to  respondent 

No.4 from  Rs.  25,000/-  to  Rs.  10,000/- 

02.  Succinctly stated, facts mentioned in  the 

writ  petition  are that  the  petitioner  contracted 

marriage  with  respondent  No.  3,  according to 

the  Muslim  Rites  and  Ceremonies in  the  year 

2 

Writ Petition  No.531 of 2022 

2013.  From 

the  wedlock, 

one 

child 

respondents No.4 was born.  Respondents No.3· 

&  4 filed  two  suits i.e.  suit for  recovery of  past 

and  future  maintenance of  minor  and  suit  for 

recovery  of  dowry  articles  amounting  to  Rs. 

46,39,500/-  which  were  decreed  in  favor  of 

respondents. The  suits  were  contested  by the 

petitioner. 

03.  After  framing  of  issues  and  recording 

the  evidence,  learned  trial  Court  has  passed 

impugned 

judgment 

and  decree  dated 

27.09.2021, whereby, suit of  respondents No.3 

&  4  to the  extent  of dowry  articles,  recovery of 

monthly  maintenance  of  respondent  No.4  at 

the  rate  of  Rs.  25,000/-  per  month  from  the 

date  of  institution  of  the  suit  till  his 

legal 

entitlement  with  10°/o  annual  increase,  was 

decreed. 

04.  The  petitioner  filed  an  appeal  against 

the  judgment  and decree which  has  also been 

dismissed  by  the  Court  of  learned  Additional 

District  Judge  (MCAC),  West-Islamabad  vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated  13.12.2021. 

Against  the  concurrent  findings  of  both  the 

3 

Writ Petition No.531of2022 

learned  lower  Courts,  the  petitioner  has  filed 

instant writ  petition. 

05. 

Learned counsel for  the  petitioner,  inter 

a/la,  contends 

that  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  passed  by 

learned 

lower Courts are not tenable  in  the  eyes  of  law 

as  the  learned  Courts  below  badly  failed  to 

consider  the  important  facts  of  law,  hence 

both the  impugned judgments  and decrees are 

liable to  be  set aside and monthly  maintenance 

awarded  to  respondent  No.4  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.25,000/- is  liable to  be  modified  at the  rate 

of  Rs.10,000/- per month. 

06. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

07. 

According  to  law,  the  petitioner  being 

father  of  the  minor  is  bound  to  pay  the 

maintenance.  Monthly  maintenance 

of 

respondent  No.4  was  fixed  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.25,000/-  per  month.  Respondent No.3  was 

also  held  entitled 

for  receiving  the  dowry 

articles according to  evidence produced by  the 

parties. 

4 

Writ Petition  No.531 of 2022 

08. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner has 

failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  in 

the 

impugned judgments and  decrees. It  is  well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash a  decision for  an  error  of  law.  It  will 

also  be 

issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an 

inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts without jurisdiction  or  in  excess 

of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise  its 

jurisdiction  or  where the  Court or  a  tribunal 

acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a  matter 

in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural  justice. 

The  High  Court  while  issuing  a  writ  of 

certiorari acts in  exercise of  supervisory and 

not  appellate jurisdiction.  The  High Court in 

exercise of  its writ jurisdiction will  not review 

the  findings of  facts  reached by the  inferior 

Court or a  tribunal.  In  this  regard, reliance is 

placed upon the cases titled  as  Amjad Khan 

VS  Muhammad 

Irshad 

(Deceased) 

through  LRs,  (2020  SCMR  2155), 

President 

All 

Pakistan  Women 

Association,

Writ Petition  No.531 of 2022 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020  SCMR  260),  Chief  Executive 

MEPCO and  others  VS  Muhammad  Fazil 

and  others  (2019  SCMR 919),  Chairman, 

NAB  VS  Muhammad  Usman and  others 

{PLO 2018  SC 28)  and  Shajar  Islam  VS 

Muhammad  Siddique  and  2  others  {PLO 

2007SC45J. 

09. 

Further, there  are concurrent  findings of 

both  the  learned  Courts  below  against  the 

petitioner.  In  case  of concurrent findings of the 

·  courts  below,  scope  of  constitutional  petition 

becomes very  limited. The  petitioner  has  failed 

to  point  out  any  misreading or  non-reading of 

the  evidence. It  has  been  laid  down  in  a  case 

titled  as 

''Syed Arif  Ali  Sabri  VS  Abdul 

Samad through  L.Rs. and 2 others"  (2008 

YLR 2309 l'  that: 

"When there  are  concurrent  findings 

of  Courts  below,  the  scope  of  the 

constitutional 

petition 

for 

interference  is  very limited  and it  can 

only  be interfered  when the  orders  of 

the  Courts  below  are 

fanciful  or 

based on  misreading  or  non-reading 

of the  evidence", 

6 

Writ Petition No.531of2022 

The same view  has  also been taken  in  a  case 

titled  as 

''Sadruddin  VS  Aslam Madad Ali 

and others" (PLO 2008  Karachi 2005). 

10. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  dated 

13.12.2021 and 27.09.2021, passed  by learned 

Additional  District  Judge 

(MCAC),  West- 

Islamabad  and  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III 

(Judge  Family  Court),  West-Islamabad, 

respectively,  are  in  accordance  with  law  and 

facts  of  the  matter,  hence do  not  require  any 

interference by this Court. 

11. 

In  view  of  above  prospective, 

the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is  dismissed  in limine.
