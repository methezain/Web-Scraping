GHULAM  AZAM  QAMBRANI.  J.:-  Appellant 

(Hajra  Kayani)  assailed 

the 

judgment 

dated 

25.09.2019, 

passed 

by 

the 

learned 

Judicial 

Magistrate,  Section-30,  Islamabad-West, 

in  case 

F.l.R  228  dated  16-07-2016,  under  Sections  380  & 

109  P.P.C  registered  Police  Station  Sabzi  Mandi, 

Islamabad,  whereby 

the  respondents/  accused 

were  acquitted  from the  charge. 

2. 

Briefly  stated  facts  of  the  prosecution  case 

are  that  on  16.07.2016,  the  complainant  namely 

Hajra  Kayani  lodged  F.l.R  No.228/2016  with  Police 

Station  Sabzi Mandi, Islamabad,  with  the  averments 

that  she  along  with  family  are  residing  at  House 

No.1768, Street  No.25, Sector  1-10/2,  Islamabad.  On 

2 

Cr/. Appeal No.3212020 

14.06.2016, their  relative  Nasreen  Begum came to 

visit them  from Sahiwal and she was given a room 

in 

their  house,  where  mother-in-law  of  the 

complainant was already  residing. A briefcase was 

lying in  the  almirah  wherein  jewelry,  Rs.29,000/  

(twenty nine thousand  only) cash etc, were kept. It 

has  been  alleged  that  on  28.06.2016,  when  the 

above said guest  left their  house, she  checked the 

briefcase  lying in  the  Almirah and  found that  the 

above  said  cash  and  jewelry  were  missing. After 

registration  of  the  F.l.R,  the  brother  of  accused, 

namely  Mureed Hussain, was  also  involved in the 

matter  allegedly  being  the  conspirator  of  the 

offence. Both, the  accused persons  namely Mureed 

Hussain  and  his  sister  Nasreen  Begum, filed pre  

arrest  bail application which was dismissed due to 

their  non-appearance.  Resultantly, police arrested 

them.  After  thorough  investigation,  challan  was 

submitted  before  the  learned  Judicial Magistrate, 

Section-30 (West), Islamabad. 

3. 

The 

learned 

Judicial  Magistrate,  after 

fulfilling  the  codal  formalities,  framed  charge 

against  the  accused persons  to  which they  denied 

3 

Crl  Appeal No.32ao20 

and claimed Trial. The prosecution  was directed to 

produce  evidence. In order  to  prove  the  case, the 

prosecution  produced only complainant of the case 

as  PW-1. The accused persons  filed an  application 

under  Section 249-A Cr.P.C. The learned  trial  Court 

heard  arguments  on the application and vide order 

dated 

25.09.2019, 

acquitted 

the 

respondents/accused 

from  the  charge.  Feeling 

aggrieved  from  the  order  dated  25.09.2019;  the 

appellant has filed the instant appeal. 

4. 

The 

learned  counsel  for 

the  appellant 

contended  that  there  were  three  other  witnesses 

but  their  statements  were  not  recorded  by  the 

learned trial Court and passed the impugned order, 

in  a  hasty  manner,  which  is  nullity  in the  eyes  of 

law and prayed for acceptance of the appeal. 

5. 

I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

appellant and perused the available record. 

6. 

The  perusal  of  record  reveals  that 

the 

incident  is  stated  to  have  been  committed  on 

14.06.2016,  while  F.I.R  has  been  registered  on 

16.07.2016,  after  about  delay  of  more  than  oneÂ· 

4 

Cr/. Aweal  No.3212020 

month  without  any plausible  explanation. There  is 

no  direct  evidence available  on  record  to  connect 

the  respondents/accused  with  the  commission  of 

the  alleged  offence.  Both  respondents  were 

arrested  and interrogated  by the police but nothing 

was  recovered  from  them.  In  the  statement  of 

complainant, 

she 

has 

made 

dishonest 

improvements  with  regard  to  the  alleged  stolen 

articles.  Complainant  is  the  only  witness  against 

the  accused  persons  who  initially  nominated  the 

accused  Nasreen  Younas and  thereafter,  she  also 

involved her  brother,  namely  Mureed  Hussain on 

account  that  he  had  telephonic  contact  with 

Nasreen  Begum.  On  the  other  hand,  the  lady 

accused was involved on the basis of doubt that she 

stayed at their  house, as guest. There is not an iota 

of  evidence  to  connect  the  accused  persons  with 

the  commission  of  the  alleged  offence, even  the 

specific date and time of the alleged occurrence has 

also not been mentioned. 

7. 

The record further  reflects that  an affidavit of 

one Mst. Shaista Begum has been  placed on record 

wherein  she  stated 

that  the  accused  Nasreen 

5 

Cr/.  Appeal  No.3212020 

Vounas, on 07.07.2016, came to their  house on the 

Eid Day and gave Rs. 500 /500 each to their  child as 

Eidi and  she  saw  some  gold  articles  in  her  hand. 

She further  stated  that  lady accused had no means 

to  purchase  such gold articles.  There  is  statement 

of one  Ejaz ul  Haq wherein  he  has  stated  that  the 

daughter  of Nasreen  Begum came  at  their  house, 

she had been wearing gold articles  and afterwards 

he  came  to  know  that  the  gold  ornaments  were 

infact  stolen  one  from  the  house  of  complainant 

and another  witness, namely Asif [avald, has stated 

that  the respondent/Nasreen  had stolen her laptop 

and mobile phone from their house. 

8. 

I  have  given  anxious 

thought 

to 

the 

statements  of  these  witnesses  recorded  under 

Section 161  Cr.P.C.  Neither  they  are  eyewitnesses 

of the alleged occurrence nor have given any sort of 

role  in  their  statements  to  the  respondents  to 

connect  them  with  the  commission  of the  alleged 

offence. If the  statements  of these  witnesses  were 

recorded  by the  learned  Judicial Magistrate, even 

then, these were not helpful to the prosecution.

9. 

The 

learned 

trial  Court,  after  proper 

appraisal  of  evidence  available  on  record,  has 

rightly concluded that the prosecution  has failed to 

prove  the  case  against  the  accused  and  rightly 

acquitted  the  accused  persons.  I  have  found  no 

illegality or irregularity  in the judgment  impugned, 

nor  the  same  is  suffering from any  misreading  or 

non-reading  or  misappropriation  of  evidence, 

warranting  interference by this Court. 

10.  Resultantly,  the  instant  appeal  having  no 

force, is dismissed jn Umjne.
