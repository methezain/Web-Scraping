24.01.2001.  Respondent  No.1  after  the  death  of  Mohammad  Shafi 

approached  the  family  of  late  Muhammad  Shafi/appellants  to  transfer  the 

suit  plot  to  her  and  upon  their  refusal  to  do  so  filed  suit  for  specific 

performance  before  the  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Islamabad,  who  vide 

judgment and decree dated 18.02.2020, decreed the suit in her favour. The 

appellants  who  were  Defendants  No.  1  to  9  in  the  suit,  being  aggrieved 

with the judgment and decree dated 18.02.2020, has filed the instant appeal 

before this court.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for the  appellants  admits  the  facts  to the  extent of 

allotment  of  plot  No.  526,  vide  order  dated  04.03.2006  and  subsequent 

allotment  of  plot  No. 414 in exchange  of the previous plot. He submitted 

that the appellants are the only legal heirs of Muhammad Shafi (late) as his 

wife  Hassan  Jan,  has  also  expired  during  the  suit  proceedings;  that  late 

Muhammad Shafi was the legal and lawful owner of suit Plot No. 414 and 

the agreement on the basis of which suit for specific performance has been 

filed by Respondent No. 1 is fake and forged; that the installments  of the 

plot  have  been  paid  by  late  Muhammad  Shafi  and  after  his  death  by  his 

wife Hassan Jan; that during the trial proceedings the PWs had proved that 

the  registered  sale  deed  dated  05.06.1996,  and  registered  Irrevocable 

General Power of Attorney in favour of Respondent No. 1 to be fake which 

were  got  registered  in  connivance  with  the  Registration  Authorities;  that 

the learned Trial Court has committed material illegality and irregularity by 

ignoring  the  oral  and  documentary  evidence  and  record  produced  during 

trial    by  the  appellants  and  has  passed  the  judgment  in  an  arbitrary  and 

unjust  manner  which  has  deprived  the  legal  heirs  /  appellants  from  their 

lawful right of inheriting the property of their late father.  

4.   On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for the  respondents  vehemently 

opposed  the  contentions  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  and  submitted 

that  late  Muhammad  Shafi  during  his  life  time,  vide  agreement  dated 

13.05.1996  had  sold  the  suit  plot  for  sale  consideration  of  Rs.  200,000/-              

(Rupees Two Hundred Thousand Only) out of which he received 199,000/- 

at  the  time  of  registration  of  sale  deed,  vide  No.  2321  dated  05.06.1996; 

that  late  Muhammad  Shafi,  vide  Irrevocable  General  Power  of  Attorney 

registered  at  No.  1890  dated  05.06.1996,  appointed  Respondent  No.  1  as 

R.F.A No. 182/2020 

3 

his  true  and  lawful  General  Attorney;  that  his  son  Maqsood  Ahmed  was 

one of the witnesses to the irrevocable General Power of Attorney and sale 

deed  dated  05.06.1996.  Learned  counsel  submitted  that  the  legal  heirs  of 

late Muhammad Shafi, after his death, were responsible to transfer the suit 

land  in  Respondent  No.1’s  name  which  she  purchased,  vide  Sale  Deed 

dated  05.06.1996,  who  have  refused  to  perform  their  part;  that  the 

allegation  of  forgery  has  not  been  proved  by  the  appellant  as  during  the 

trial, the thumb impression and the signature of late Muhammad Shafi were 

sent for forensic verification to FIA, report of which  proved the signature 

and thumb impression to be of late Muhammad Shafi. Learned counsel for 

Respondent No. 1 submitted that the impugned judgment and decree is well 

reasoned  and  based  on  proper  appreciation  of  documentary  and  oral 

evidence, therefore, the instant appeal is liable to be dismissed.  

5. 

Argument heard record perused. 

6. 

Record  of  the  case  has  been  thoroughly  examined.  The  irrevocable 

General Power of Attorney bearing thumb impression and signature of late 

Muhammad Shafi, whereby he appointed Respondent No. 1 as a legal and 

lawful attorney, has been registered vide No. 1890, Book 4, Volume 308 at 

pages  82  &  83  dated  05.06.1996  by  the  Sub  Registrar,  Islamabad.  The 

document bears signature of Maqsood Ahmed S/o Muhammad Shafi (late) 

as  a  witness  alongwith  two  others  witnesses  namely  Khaliq  Dad  and 

Muhammad  Khushi.    The  sale  deed  between  late  Muhammad  Shafi  and 

Respondent No. 1 has also been scrutinized, which reveals that same is also 

registered, vide No. 2321 in book No. 1 Volume 1095  at page No. 27 on 

05.06.1996.  This  registered  document  also  bears  signature  and  thumb 

impression  of  late  Muhammad  Shafi  and  further  revealed  that  Maqsood 

Ahmed s/o late Muhammad Shafi was also a witness alongwith two other 

witnesses  in  it.  Perusal  of  sale  deed  reveals  that  out  of  total  sale 

consideration of Rs. 200,000/- (Rupees Two Hundred Thousand Only), an 

amount  of  rupees  199,000/-  (One  lac  Ninety  Nine  Thousand)  was 

admittedly received by late Muhammad Shafi as ‘Biayna’ and the balance 

sale consideration was to be received at the time of transfer of the suit plot. 

Amjad Hussain an employee of Deputy Commissioner Office appeared as 

PW-1  and  produced  the  record  of  registration  in  respect  of  Power  of 

R.F.A No. 182/2020 

4 

Attorney  and  Sale  Deed.  Muhammad  Khushal  one  of  the  marginal 

witnesses  appeared as PW-3.  He was also an employee  of  Quaid-e-Azam 

University.  He  corroborated  the  transaction  of  sale  of  suit  plot  to 

Respondent No. 1 in his presence and verified the signature of Muhammad 

Shafi  (late)  on  the  registered  documents  and  accepted  that  he  signed  the 

documents as witness. Due to the death of another marginal witness namely 

Khalid  Dad,  his  son  Shahid  Khan  appeared  as  PW-4  and  verified  the 

signature of his late father on the documents. Perusal of the record revealed 

that  during  the  trial  proceedings,  the  thumb  impression  and  the  signature 

were  sent  for  comparison  of  thumb  impression  and  signatures  of  late 
Muhammad  Shafi  vide  order  dated  11.01.2014  by  learned  Civil  Judge  1st 

Class  (West),  Islamabad  on  the  application  of  the  Respondent  No.  1 

(plaintiff  in  the  suit).  The  examiner  of  FP  &  QD,  FIA  Headquarter 

Islamabad, vide report dated 02.11.2015 verified that the thumb impression 

is  identical  and  the  signatures  are  similar  in  characters  with  that  of 

Muhammad  Shafi  (late).  All  these  documentary  and  oral  evidences  were 

duly considered by the learned Trial Court and are enough material to form 

the  view  that  late  Muhammad  Shafi  had  sold  his  plot  allotted  to  him  by 

Quaid-e-Azam  University,  while  he  was  in  service,  to  Respondent  No.  1 

through  registered  Sale  Deed  and  irrevocable  General  Power  of  Attorney 

dated 05.06.1996. It is well settled that agreement, power of attorneys and 

deeds etc, duly registered by Registration Authority in accordance with law 

become a legal document and carry presumption of truth and require strong 

evidence to cast suspicious on the authenticity of such document. The onus 

is  on  the  person  who  challenges  the  authenticity  of  the  registered 

documents to prove with strong, reliable and confident inspiring evidence, 

likewise in the present case mere verbal assertions of the appellants are not 

enough to declare the registered sale deed and power of attorney to be fake, 

fabricated  and  fictitious,  and  their  genuineness,  which  being  a  registered 

document got presumption of correctness and validity attached to it cannot 

be  discarded  without  any  reliable  evidence.  The  ratio  has  been  settled  in 

cases  re:  Nawab  Din VSBagh  (1994  SCMR  1975),  Al-Haj  Sheikh 

Abdul  Hafeez VSSuhail  Zaman  (2020  PLD  208  Karachi),  The 

Government  of 

Iraq 

through  Embassy  of 

the  Republic  of 

Iraq VSDeedar Hussain (2016 YLR 2246 Karachai).

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  also  raised  an  objection  with 

regard to limitation in filing of suit by the Respondent No. 1 by taking the 

plea that the agreement was executed between the parties in 1996, whereas, 

the suit for specific performance has been filed by Respondent No. 1 in the 

year 2006 thus is hit by limitation under article 113 of the Limitation Act, 

1908, as it provides filing of suit for specific performance a limitation with 

in the period of 3 years. In this regard learned counsel for Respondent No.1 

has argued that the suit has been filed soon after the legal heirs refused to 

perform  their  part  of  agreement  to  transfer  the  suit  plot  in  her  name  and, 

therefore,  the  suit  filed  by  Respondent  No.1  is  well  within  time  as  no 

specific  date  for  transfer  of  the  suit  plot  is  mentioned  on  the  sale 

agreement/sale deed and relied on the case laws reported as Mrs. Sherbano 

VS Kamil  Muhammad  Khan  (PLD  2012  Sindh  293),  Malik  Imam 

Bux VSMehrab (1995 CLC 109), Muhammad Yasin VSAllah Din 

(1991  CLC  1457)  &  Muhammad  Shafi  VS Muhammad  Sarwar  and 

others (1997 CLC 1231), wherein it has been held that the limitation starts 

running from the date fixed for performance and in case no date was fixed 

it  starts  when  the  performance  is  refused.  Perusal  of  the  sale  deed  dated 

05.06.1996, supports the arguments of the learned counsel for Respondent 

No.1  as such in the light of settled principle, vide judgments cited by the 

learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.  1,  it  is  held  that  the  suit  was  filed 

within time and is not hit by limitation. 

8. 

For the foregoing discussion, I am of the considered opinion that no 

illegality  or  irregularity  has  been  committed  by  the  learned  Trial  Court 

while passing the judgment and decree dated 18.2.2020, hence, the same is 

upheld. Consequently, instant appeal filed by the appellant is dismissed.
