Nemo.  

The  case  has  been  called  repeatedly. 

Despite repeated calls no one appeared for or 

on  behalf  of  the  petitioner.  The  case  is 

reflected  in  the  cause  list  and  there  is  no 

application 

for  an  adjournment. 

In 

the 

circumstances, 

the 

instant  petition 

is, 

therefore, dismissed for non-prosecution.
