Order  with  signature  of .Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel  where  necessar  . 
Dr.  G.M  Choudhary,  Advocate 
Petitioner. 

for 

the 

Through  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

assailed  Order  dated  20.11.2021 

("Impugned 

Order")  passed  by the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  

East,  Islamabad,  whereby, 

interim  maintenance 

allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.8,000/-  per  month  per 

child  has  been  fixed  for Respondents  No.3  & 4  . 

2. 

Facts,  in brief,  are  that  the  Petitioner  and  the 

Respondent  No.2  were  married  on  05.05.2012 

against  the  dower  amount  of Rs.  505,525/-  and  five 

(5)  tola  gold  ornaments  to  be  paid  by the  Petitioner 

to  Respondent  No.  2  within  one  year  after 

mamage. 

The  parties  were  blessed  with  two 

children  i.e.,  Respondents  No.  3_  & 4.  Respondents 

No.2  to 4 filed  suit  for Recovery  of Maintenance  & 

Dower  on  07.07.2021  on  the  allegation 

that  the 

Petitioner 

is  not  paying 

for 

the  monthly 

expenditure  of the  aforementioned  Respondents. 

3. 

The 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  East  

Islamabad,  vide  the  Impugned  Order  fixed  the 

interim  monthly  maintenance  of Respondent  No.  3 

2 I  W.P No. 365/2022 

&  4  as  aforesaid  to  be  paid  w.e.f  the  date  of  the 

Impugned  Order  and  further  held  that  in  case  of 

failure  Petitioner's  right  of defense  will  be  closed. 

The  Petitioner  has  assailed 

the  order 

through 

instant  petition. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted 

that  the  learned  Trial  Court  has  not  considered  and 

appreciated 

the  financial  status  of  the  Petitioner 

and  that  the  parties  are  living  in  the  same  house  as 

may  be seen  from  the  addresses  given  in the  title  of 

the  Plaint  filed  by  the  Respondents  No.  2  to  4.  It 

has  been 

submitted 

that 

the  Petitioner 

is 

maintaining  the  said  Respondents  and  also  his  first 

wife  and  their  children  therefore,  cannot  afford  to 

pay  the  interim  maintenance 

fixed  by  the  Court 

and  as  such  has  prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the 

Impugned  Order. 

5. 

The  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed 

in 

pursuance  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  where  under  the  Family 

Court  has  the jurisdiction  to  pass  interim  order  for 

maintenance  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings 

in  a 

suit  for  maintenance.  The  purpose  behind 

the 

provision  of  interim  maintenance 

is  to  ensure  that 

during  the  pendency  of  the  legal  proceedings,  the 

minors  are  not  faced  with  financial  challenges. 

6. 

Section  14  (3)  of the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

against  an  interim  order  passed  by  a  Family  Court 

with  the obvious  purpose  to avoid  delays. 

3 I  W.P No. 365/2022 

7. 

The 

Impugned  Order 

is  merely 

an 

interlocutory  order.  The  maintenance  fixed  through 

such  an  order  is  only  temporary.  The  quantum  of 

maintenance  may  be  modified  after  appraising  the 

evidence  produced  at trial.  An  aggrieved  party  will 

have  a  right  to  agitate  his  grievance  before  the 

appellate  Court  when  the  interim  order  merges  into 

a  final  order.  Even  otherwise,  quantum  of  interim 

maintenance,  being  a  factual  dispute  cannot  be 

made  a  ground 

for  invoking 

the  Constitutional 

jurisdiction  of this  Court. 

8. 

I  am  guided  by  the  consistent  view  taken  by 

different  Honorable  Benches  of  the  Islamabad 

High  Court, 

Islamabad 

in  various  matters 

including 

the 

reported 

cases  of  Dr.  Aqueel 

Waris VSIbrahim  Aquee/  Waris,  2020  CLC 

131;  [ 

j,  2018  CLC  506;  Mashkoor  Ahmed 

Khokhar  VSThe  Family 

Judge 

(East), 

Islamabad, 

2019  CLC  1635;  Muhammad 

Touseeq  Danial  Bhatti  VSAyesha  Naeem, 

2021  MLD 

337; 

and 

Aamir  Munir 

Puri  VSMst.  Saima  Naeem,  2021  YLR  2166, 

wherein  it  has  been  held  that  interlocutory  orders 

by 

the  Family  Court  cannot  be  assailed 

in 

Constitutional 

jurisdiction  even  though  they  may 

be  harsh  in  some  instances.  The  instant  petition  is, 

therefore,  not maintainable. 

9. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  said  discussion 

and  keeping  in  view  the  above  said  observations 

by  this  Court 

in  the  aforementioned 

cases 

the 

Impugned  Order  dated  20.11.2021  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  East-Islamabad,  does 

4 I  W.P No. 365/2022 

not  call 

for 

interference 

rn  writ 

jurisdiction. 

Consequently, 

this  Writ 

Petition 

is  hereby 

dismissed  in  liminc.
