Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel where 
necessary. 

26-10-2021.  Mr  Nishan  Ali  Abbasi,  father  of  the  petitioner,  in 

person (in morning). 

Nemo, for the petitioner(at 10:30 a.m.). 

Mr Sajjad Baloch Advocate, for respondents  
no. 2 & 3. 

In the morning Qari Nishan Ali Abbasi had 

appeared in person and had informed that  the 

learned  counsel  was  busy  before  another 

Bench. He  was told to ensure  that the  learned 

counsel appears because the hearing would not 

be adjourned.  

2.  The petition was taken up later [i.e. 10:30 

a.m.]  but  no  one  appeared  on  behalf  of  the 

petitioner.  

3.  The  office  is  directed  to  submit  a  report 

whether  the  learned  counsels,  who  have  filed 

power of attorney on behalf of the petitioner in 

the  instant  case,  had  any  other  cases  before 

other Benches, today.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.  The  record  shows  that  the  petitioner  has 

been delaying the adjudication of this petition. 

It,  prima-facie,  appears  that  a  misstatement 

was  made  in  the  morning  by  Qari  Nishan  Ali 

Abbasi.  He  is  father  of  the  petitioner.  His 

address  is  mentioned  in  the  affidavit  filed 

alongwith the petition.  

5.  The  office  is,  therefore,  directed  to  issue 

notice  to  Qari  Nishan  Ali  Abbasi,  stated  to  be 

resident of house no. 25, street no. 38, Sector 

G-6/2,  Islamabad,  to  appear  in  person  and 

explain  why  proceedings  may  not  be  initiated 

against  him 

for  what  appears  to  be  a 

misstatement so as to adjourn the petition. 

6.  Relist, on 05.11.2021.
