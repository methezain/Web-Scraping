the 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  inter  alia, 

contends that the impugned judgment and decree dated 

20.02.2020  and  09.11.2020  are  too  harsh  as  both  the 

learned  Courts  below  have  ignored  this  fact  that 

respondent  No.3  herself  left  the  house  of  the  petitioner 

without  any  reason  and  justification;  that  the  impugned 

judgment and decree are against the law and facts of the 

case  and  result  of  misreading  and  non-reading  of  the 

evidence available on record.
