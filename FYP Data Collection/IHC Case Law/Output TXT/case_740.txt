Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

                              01.02.2022.  Syed Imran Ali Gardezi, Advocate for petitioner.  

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

submitted 

that  petitioner  did  not 

receive 

summons,  issued  by  the  learned  trial  Court,  as 

the  address  on  which  the  same  was  served,  was 

not  correct.  The  petitioner  later  on  got  to  know 

about  the  proceedings,  pending  before  the 

learned  Family  Court, 

through  his 

son, 

thereafter,  he  appeared  before  the  learned  Court 

and filed an application for setting aside ex-parte 

proceedings, which was allowed. However, as per 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  the  latter  was 

not  given  sufficient  time  to  file  his  written 

statement and right to file written statement has 

been struck off, hence the instant petition.
