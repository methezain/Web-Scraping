01 

22.02.2022  Mr. Adnan Iqbal, Advocate.  

Learned  counsel  submits  that  the  learned  appellate 

court while passing the impugned order dated 08.01.2022 

failed  to  take  into  account  the  medical  certificates  of  the 

illness  of  his  parents  explaining  the  delay  of  3  days  in 

filing the appeal and it was an error patent on the face of 

the  record.    Further  states  that  the  judgment  and  decree 

passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  is  not  sustainable  in 

law  for  (i)  granting  maintenance  to  the  wife  during  the 

subsistence  of  marriage  despite  not  living  with  the 

husband,  and  (ii)  the  personal  expenses  of  the  petitioner 

not being taken into account in setting the maintenance for 

the  wife  and  the  minor  child.  Points  raised  need 

consideration.

Admit.  Let  notice  be  issued  to  the  respondents  for 

09.03.2022.

Learned  counsel  also  seeks  permission  to  place  on 

record  his  complete  application  filed  before  the  learned 

appellate  court  annexing  the  medical  certificates  of  his 

parents’  illness.    He  shall  do  so  by  filing  certified  copies 

of  the  appellate  Court’s  record  in  this  behalf  through  an 

application before the next date of hearing.
