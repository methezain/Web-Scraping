for  the 

Through 

the 

instant  bail  petition, 

the 

petitioner  seeks  bail  after  arrest  in case  FIR No. 

17/2021,  dated  17.01.2021,  offence  under 

Sections  302, 324, 148, 149, 109, 337-F(v), 337-D, 

337-A(ii),  337-A(i)  &  337-F(i)  P.P.C registered  at 

Police Station  Bani Gala, Islamabad. 

2. 

It  is  alleged  in  the  FIR  that  petitioner  I 

accused  alongwith  co-accused  while  armed  with 

weapons  attacked  upon  the  complainant  party 

and  inflicted  injuries  to  Mst.  Sadia  Bibi,  Rakiban 

Bibi,  Kamir  Shahzad,  complainant 

lshtiaq 

Hussain  and  one  Zahoor,  whereas  injured  Mst. 

Sadia Bibi succumbed  to said injuries.  Hence, the 

instant  FIR. 

3. 

On  19.01.2021,  Muhammad  Nauman  S/o 

Abdur  Rauf accused  of FIR has also submitted  an 

application 

for  registration  of  cross  version, 

wherein  he has stated  that the complainant  party 

of  the  FIR  has  attacked  on  the  accused  party. 

2 

Cr/. Misc. 418-B of 2021 

Consequently,  Muhammad Nauman  got  injured, 

Medico  Legal  Report  of 

injured  Nauman  is 

available in police record. 

4. 

Learned  Counsel 

for 

the  Petitioner 

/accused  contended 

that 

the  petitioner  has 

falsely  been implicated  through  concocted  story 

in  the  above  mentioned  case  with  malafide 

intention  by  the  complainant;  that  he is juvenile 

and  a student  of  secondary  school;  that  he is  a 

law  abiding  citizen  of  Pakistan  and  has  never 

been involved in any criminal  litigation;  that there 

is  no  apprehension  of  his  abscondence  or 

tampering  with the prosecution  evidence; that  he 

was  arrested  on  09.03.2021 and  has undergone 

three  days  physical  remand;  that  it  is  a  case  of 

cross  version  which  establishes  that  attack  was 

launched  by  the  other  side;  that  the  factum  of 

wider  net is clear from the contents  of FIR where 

the  complainant  has  not  spared  any  member of 

family  of  the  petitioner;  that  contents  of the  FIR 

itself reveal that story of the FIR is concocted  one 

and is not truly  narrated  as per facts  and there is 

a  clear  delay  in  lodging  of  FIR. Lastly,  learned 

Counsel for  the  petitioner  I  accused  prayed  for 

acceptance of his bail petition. 

05.  Conversely, 

learned  State  Counsel 

assisted  by 

the 

learned  Counsel 

for 

the 

Complainant  has  controverted 

the  arguments 

advanced  by 

the 

learned  Counsel  for 

the 

petitioner/accused 

and 

stated 

that 

3 

Cr/. Misc. 418~B  o/2021 

petitioner/accused  is  specifically  nominated  in 

the  FIR; recovery  of  Vanda  has  been  effected 

from  him;  offences  fall  under  the  prohibitory 

clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C; police  has rejected 

the cross version of the accused party; sufficient 

incriminating  evidence  is  available  against  the 

petitioner/accused,  hence  he  is  not  entitled  for 

grant of bail after arrest. 

06. 

I  have heard  the  arguments  advanced  by 

learned counsel for  the  petitioner,  learned State 

Counsel,  learned  Counsel  for  the  complainant 

and  perused 

the 

record  with 

their  able 

assistance. 

07.  There 

is  no  allegation  against 

the 

petitioner/accused  of  causing  any  injury  to  Mst. 

Sadia Bibi (deceased); the first  allegation against 

him  is  that  he  along  with  Sabiha  Bibi  caused 

Danda blow upon Kamir Shahzad, resultantly,  his 

right 

leg  was 

fractured;  second  allegation 

against  him  is  that  he  along  with  Sabiha  Bibi 

inflicted  Danda  blows  upon  complainant  which 

hit  on  his  back  and  the  third  allegation  against 

him is that  he alongwith  Sabiha Bibi gave Danda 

blows to Zahoor and his right arm was fractured. 

08. 

In  Medico Legal Report  of  lshtiaq  Hussain 

complainant, there  is only an Abrasion shown on 

the lower back of the injured/complainant. MLR of 

Zahoor Ahmad shows that  there  is  a Trauma to 

left  Forearm as well  as fracture  of  left  ulna/arm. 

According 

to  allegations  leveled  in  FIR,  the 

4 

Cr/.  Misc. 418~B  o/2021 

injuries  of  Danda  blows  inflicted  upon the  said 

three 

injured  were 

jointly 

inflicted  by 

the 

petitioner  and his sister  Mst. Sabiha Bibi. 

09.  According  to  the  contents  of  FIR, there  is 

allegation of causing fracture  on the right  arm of 

Zahoor  Ahmad,  whereas  in  the  Medico  Legal 

Report  (MLR) it  has  mentioned  that  fracture  of 

left  arm  was  caused.  So,  there  are  material 

contradictions 

in 

the  ocular  and  medical 

evidence. 

10.  The  complainant  has  nominated 

two 

brothers,  sister,  father  and  mother  alongwith 

four  uncles  and  cousins  of  the  petitioner  as 

accused in the  FIR. He has tried  to  entangle the 

whole family in the case. 

11.  Police  has  entered/recorded 

the  cross 

version of the accused party  in the case and also 

added  Sections  337-A(i),  337-F(iii),  148  &  149 

PPC on the  basis of  MLR of  Nauman S/o Abdur 

Rauf who  is  an  accused  in  the  FIR but  as  per 

cross  version  he  received 

injuries  by 

the 

complainant party.  Subsequently, the  police  has 

negated the  cross  version.  It  is  admitted  by the 

Investigating  Officer 

in  police 

record 

that 

Nauman S/o Abdur  Rauf received  injuries  in the 

occurrence  but  the  stance  of  1.0  is  that  he 

received 

injuries  by 

the  co-accused 

I  his 

companions named in  the  FIR. However, police 

opinion  is  not  supported  by  any  evidence. This 

fact  is  not  mentioned  by  any  witness  in  the 

5 

Cr/. Misc. 418-B o/2021 

statement  recorded  U/s 161  Cr.P.C that  Nauman 

accused  got  injured  by  the  hands  of  other 

members of accused party I his companions,as it 

is a case of cross version. 

12.  Question  of  aggression 

is  still 

to  be 

determined.  In a reported  case titled  as  "Sohalb 

Mehmood Butt  V. 

lftlkhar-ul-Hag (1996 SCMR 

1845)", 

the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  while 

providing  guidelines 

for 

the  exercise  of 

jurisdiction 

in  bail  matter  in  the  cases  of  two 

counter  versions  arising  from  the  same incident 

held as under; 

"Now  what  would  constitute  as 

sufficient  grounds  for 

further  Inquiry 

would depend on  the  peculiar  facts  of 

each case and no hard and fast rule can 

be  /aid  down  for  that  purpose.  Every 

hypothetical  question  which  can  be 

Imagined would not  make It  a  case  of 

further Inquiry simply for the reason that It 

can  be  answered  by  the  trial  Court 

subsequently after evaluation of evidence. 

Broadly speaking, the condition /aid down 

In clause (2) of section 497, Cr.P.C. Is that 

there  are  suR/clent grounds  for  further 

Inquiry Into his guilt  which means that the 

question would be such which has nexus 

with the result of the case and may show 

or tend to show that accused Is not guilt of 

the  offence with  which he  charged. For 

example, If accused Is charged for offence 

6 

Cr/. Misc.  418-B o/2021 

under section 302, P.P. C.  but  there are 

grounds  for  further  enquiry  which may 

show that he may not be convicted of the 

charge under section 302, P.P. C.  but may 

be  acquitted  or  convicted  for  a  lesser 

offence." 

"In the counter-versions arising from 

the  same 

Incident,  one  given  by 

complainant In F.l.R and the other given 

by the opposite party  case-law Is almost 

settled that such cases are covered for 

grant  of  ball  on  the  ground  of  further 

enquiry as  contemplated under section 

497(2), Cr.P.C. In  such  cases normally, 

ball Is granted on the ground of further 

enquiry for the reason that the question 

as  to  which version Is  correct  Is  to  be 

decided  by  the  trial  Court  which  Is 

supposed to  record  evidence and  also 

appraise the same In order to come to a 

final conclusion In this regard. In cases of 

counter-versions,  normally,  plea  of 

private  defence Is  taken giving  rise  to 

question as to  which party  Is aggressor 

and which party Is aggressed". 

Further  reliance  in this  regard  can also be placed 

on  the  case  titled  as  "Mehmood Akhtar  and 

another V.  Ha# Nazir Ahmad and 4 others (1995 

SCMR310J'~ 

7 

Cr/. Misc. 418-B of 2021 

13. 

It is well  settled  principle  of law that  while 

deciding the bail application,  before recording  of 

evidence 

in 

the 

trial  Court,  only 

tentative 

assessment is to  be made by the  Court and it  is 

not  permissible  to  go  into  details  of  evidence in 

one  way  or  the  other  that  might  prejudice  the 

case  of  either  party.  In  this  regard  reliance  is 

placed  upon PLO 94 Supreme  Court  65. PLO 94 

Supreme  Court  88.  2021  SCMR  111 and  2020 

SCMR937. 

14. 

It is important  to  remember that  bail is not 

to be withheld as a punishment. There is no legal 

or  moral  compulsion  to  keep  the  people  in jail 

merely  on 

the  allegation 

that 

they  have 

committed  offences  punishable  with  death  or 

transportation,  unless reasonable  grounds  exist 

to  disclose 

their  complicity.  The  ultimate 

conviction  and  incarceration  of  a  guilty  person 

can repair the wrong caused by a mistaken relief 

of  bail  after  arrest  granted  to  him,  but  no 

satisfactory  reparation  can  be  offered  to  an 

innocent man for  his unjustified  incarceration  at 

any stage  of  the  case  albeit  his  acquittal  in the 

long run.  Reliance is  placed  on a case  reported 

as  11Manzoor and  4  others  VS  The State•  {PLO 

1972SC81J". 

15. 

It is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a 

case titled  as  11Zalgham Ashraf  VS  The State and 

others"  {_2016  SCMR  18) 

that  "to  curtail  the 

liberty  of  a  person  is  a  serious  step  in  law, 

8 

Cr/. Misc. 418-B o/2021 

therefore,  the  Judges  shall  apply judicial  mind 

with  deep  thought  for  reaching  at  a  fair  and 

proper  conclusion albeit  tentatively  however, this 

exercise shall not  to be carried  out in  vacuum or 

in a flimsy and casual manner as that  will defeat 

the  ends  of  justice  because  if  the  accused 

charged,  is  ultimately  acquitted  at  the  trial  then 

no reparation  or  compensation  can be awarded 

to  him 

for 

the 

long 

incarceration,  as 

the 

provisions  of  Criminal  Procedure  Code and  the 

scheme of law  on the subject  do not provide  for 

such arrangements  to repair  the loss, caused to 

an accused person,  detaining  him in Jail  without 

just  cause and reasonable ground." 

16. 

Investigation 

in 

the  case  has  been 

completed and the petitioner/accused is no more 

required  for  the  purpose  of  investigation.  He is 

previously non-convict and is behind the bars for 

the  last  more  than  02  months.  Trial  of  the 

petitioner  I  accused  has  not  seen  any  fruitful 

progress  as  yet, 

therefore, 

his 

further 

incarceration In jail  would not serve any purpose. 

17.  A  tentative  assessment of  record  shows 

that  present  petitioner  has  made out  a  case  of 

further  inquiry. 

18. 

In  view  of  above,  instant  petition 

is 

accepted  and  the  petitioner  is  admitted  to  bail 

subject  to  furnishing  bail  bonds  in  the  sum  of 

Rs. 100,0001-  (One Hundred Thousand only) with 

9 

Cr/. Misc. 418-B o/2021 

one  surety  each  in  the  like  amount  to  the 

satisfaction of learned trial  Court. 

19.  Needless to mention that, this  is a tentative 

assessment  which  shall  not  affect  the  trial  of 

case in any manner.
