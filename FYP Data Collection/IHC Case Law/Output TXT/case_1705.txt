for 

                Through this petition under section 498 read 

with  section  435/439  Cr.P.C,  petitioner  {Hassan  Ali 

Raja}  seeks  pre-arrest  bail  in  case  FIR  No.43  dated 

11.03.2017, under Section 406 PPC, registered at Police 

Station Banni Gala, Islamabad.   

2. 

      Precisely,  facts  relevant  for  disposal  of 

instant petition are that complainant-respondent No.2 

entered into a deal for purchase of a plot measuring 1-

kanal  18-marlas  situated  at  Kurri  Road,  Islamabad 

with the petitioner and paid sale consideration to the 

tune  Rs.20,000,000/-    {two  crore}    vide  cheque  dated 

20.02.2017 but neither  the  plot was  transferred  in  his 

name  nor  the  amount  received  was  returned  to  him. 

After  the  registration  of  FIR,  petitioner  resorted  pre-

arrest  bail  which was allowed  by  learned  Additional

                             -2- 

Sessions  Judge  Islamabad-East  vide  order  dated 

12.05.2017.  Record  annexed  with  the  petition  shows 

that  petitioner  became  absent  and  after  undergoing 

proceedings  as  per  law,  was  declared  proclaimed 

offender  vide  order  dated  21.11.2017  by  the  learned 

Judicial  Magistrate  Section  30  Islamabad-East.  It  is 

matter  of  record  that  the  complainant  assailed  bail 

granting  order  dated  12.05.2017  before  this  Court 

through criminal misc. 315-BC of 2017 and vide order 

dated  03.11.2017  his  bail  was  cancelled  by  observing 

as under:- 

for  respondent 

    “Respondent  is  not  in  attendance.  Learned 
counsel 
in  connected  writ 
petition  No.1122/2017  informed  the  Court  that 
respondent has left the country and is in abroad, 
but  his  exact  location  and  particulars  are  not 
available.  
2.    Since  respondent  is  a  proclaimed  offender, 
he  jumped  over  the  concession  of  bail  rather 
misuse  the  same.  Despite  specific  direction, 
respondent  failed  to  put  appearance  before  the 
Court, therefore, instant petition is accepted and 
bail  granted  to  the  respondent 
is  hereby 
cancelled.  If  bail  has  not  been  already  cancelled 
by  the  learned  Trial  Court,  same  shall  be 
presumed  to  be  cancelled  by  the  order  of  this 
Court.”   

3. 

      Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends 

that abscondence of petitioner was neither intentional 

nor  willful  but  was  to  save  the  lives  of  his  family 

members  and  of  his  own  from  the  hands  of 

complainant,  who  then  was  Secretary  to  Prime 

Minister;  that  abscondence  itself  is  no  ground  for 

refusal of bail; that case  of the petitioner falls within 

the ambit of Section 497(2) Cr. PC which entitles him 

 
 
    
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -3- 

for grant of bail; that petitioner had already joined the 

investigation and is ready to appear before the Court 

and nothing is to be recovered from the possession of 

present  petitioner.  Learned  counsel  fortified  his 

submissions  by  placing  reliance  on  case  law  cited  as 

2018 MLD 768 titled Muhammad Jamil.  VS  Zahidullah alias 

Zohaib  and  2  others,  2012  MLD  574  [Sindh]  titled  Suleman.  

VS      The  State,  PLD  1995  SC  34  titled  Tariq  Bashir  and  5 

others.    VS  The  State,  2017  PCr.L.J  133  [Islamabad]  titled 

Muhammad  Nawaz.  VS  SHO,  Police  Station  Sabzi  Mandi, 

Islamabad and others.  

4. 

      Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel  assisted 

by learned counsel for complainant/respondent No.2, 

repelled  the  above submissions,  inter-alia  stating  that 

petitioner  is  specifically  named  in  the  FIR;  no  malice 

or malafide has even been alleged on the part of police 

or  complainant;  that  the  petitioner  has  failed  to 

substantiate  his  excuse  of  absence  through  any 

document.  It  is  further  asserted  that  the  contents  of 

FIR  and  the  documents  annexed  with  report  under 

Section 173 Cr.PC do attract section 406 PPC. Learned 

counsel  added  that  in  presence  of  specific  admission 

regarding alleged sale transaction, receipt of part sale 

consideration  and  non-transfer  of  land  pursuant  to 

the  sale  agreement,  ipso  facto,  proves  ill  intention  of 

the petitioner to deprive the complainant of his hard 

earned  money.  Therefore,  he  cannot  be  held  entitled 

to the concession of bail particularly when he jumped 

over  the  concession  and  had  been  keeping  himself 

away  from  the  process  of  law  and  was  declared  a 

proclaimed  offender.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  case

(murder case). The case law referred do not extend any 

help  to  the  complainant  due  to  having  distinct 

question of law and facts.   

5. 

   In  respect  of  last  submission,  learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner  drawn 

the  attention 

to 

the 

documents  placed  on  file  through  Cr.  Misc.34/2020 

which  includes  copy  of  Judgment  dated  03.02.2020 

whereby, order regarding declaration of the petitioner 

as  proclaimed  offender  in  second  FIR  No.54/2017  of 

P.S.  Margalla,  Islamabad  was  set-aside.  Learned 

counsel added that petitioner undertakes to surrender 

to the court of competent jurisdiction and to appear as 

and when directed.  

6. 

      Heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties 

and perused the record with their able assistance.  

7. 

      The  occurrence  in  the  case  allegedly  took 

place  on  20.02.2017  when  the  complainant  paid 

 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -5- 

Rs.20,000,000/-  vide  cheque  and  FIR  No.43  was 

registered on 11.03.2017 under section 406 PPC, at P.S. 

Banni  Gala,  Islamabad.  The  amount  was  allegedly 

given  to  the  petitioner/accused  pursuant  to  a  deal 

regarding  purchase  of  plot  measuring  1-kanal  18-

marlas  situated  at  Kurri  Road,  Islamabad.  The 

petitioner/accused was granted pre-arrest bail in case 

FIR  No.43/2017  by  learned  ASJ  Islamabad-East  vide 

order  dated  12.05.2017.  After  submission  of  challan, 

petitioner/accused 

became 

absent 

and 

after 

undergoing proceedings  as per law,  he was declared 

proclaimed  offender  vide  order  dated  21.11.2017  by 

the learned Judicial Magistrate Section 30 Islamabad-

East.  The  complainant/respondent    No.2  filed  bail 

cancellation  petition  {Criminal  Misc.  315-BC  of  2017} 

in  FIR  No.43/2017  and  vide  order  dated  03.11.2017 

{reproduced  in  para-2  above}  his  bail  was  cancelled. 

The complainant also got registered FIR No.54 dated 

06.03.2017  under  section  406  PPC,  P.S.  Margalla, 

Islamabad.  In  this  FIR,  petitioner  was  granted  pre-

arrest  bail  by  learned  ASJ-III,  Islamabad-West  vide 

order  dated  12.04.2017.  Subsequently,  petitioner/ 

accused was declared proclaimed offender by learned 

Judicial Magistrate vide order dated 14.12.2019 in the 

said  FIR.  Petitioner/accused  assailed  the  said  order 

through  revision  petition  which  was  allowed  by 

learned  ASJ 

Islamabad-West  vide  order  dated 

03.02.2020  and 

the 

impugned  order  regarding 

declaration as proclaimed offender was set-aside and 

 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -6- 

petitioner  was  directed  to  appear  before  the  learned 

Trial Court.  

8. 

         Criminal  jurisprudence  lays  emphasis  to 

examine every criminal case in its own peculiar facts 

and  circumstances.  The  law  is  to  be  followed,  in  its 

true import and not at the whims or desire of any of 

the parties. The events, as put forth by the parties, do 

lead  to  draw  inference  that  on  merits,  case  of  the 

petitioner,  is  one  of  further  inquiry,  for  the  reasons 

that complainant got registered two FIRs; one at-hand 

i.e.  F.I.R.  No.43  dated  11.03.2017  while  the  other 

bearing  No.54,  dated  06.03.2017  at  Police  Station 

Margalla Islamabad; FIR No. 54, lodged prior in-time, 

did  not  contain  the  description  of  alleged  mischief, 

reported 

through 

the  present  FIR 

regarding 

occurrence  of  February  2017  while  the  alleged 

transaction  i.e.  sale-purchase  does  not,  ipso  facto, 

constitutes  entrustment  and  departure  thereof  a 

criminal  breach  of  trust.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

complainant  during  the  arguments  contended  that 

moveable  property  of  the  complainant  had  been 

converted  into  own  use by  petitioner,  at  this  learned 

counsel for petitioner is of the view, that if argument 

of  learned  counsel  for  complainant  is  admitted  the 

offence  becomes  under  Section  403  PPC,  which  is 

bailable.  Whatever  it  may  be,  it  is  very  much  clear 

that whether it is Section 420 PPC, as observed by the 

two  learned  ASJs  or  Sections  406  or  403  PPC  as 

argued,  matter  is  of  civil  nature.  By  any  yardstick, 

 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -7- 

when  examined,  the  case  of  the  petitioner  becomes 

one of further inquiry.  

9. 

Next  comes  the  point  that  whether  extra 

ordinary  concession  of  pre-arrest  bail  cannot  be 

extended  to  an  accused,  who  had  been  keeping 

himself  away  from  the  process  of  law;  declared  a 

Proclaimed  Offender  and  jumped  the  concession  of 

bail.  It  is  an  offence  not  falling  within  the  ambit  of 

prohibitory clause; even the offence alleged also does 

not  fall  within  the  category  of  heinous  crimes; 

petitioner is not a previous convict; case appears to be 

one  of  further  inquiry  and  by  holding  so,  petitioner 

was allowed pre-arrest bail, that too is a factor which, 

prima  facie,  supports  the  version  of  the  petitioner 

regarding  his  false  involvement  and  the  fact  that  a 

civil  nature  lis  had  been  attempted  to  be  converted 

into  criminal  to  settle  the  score.  The  allegation  of 

jumping the concession of bail without repetition and 

keeping  himself  away  from  the  process  of  law,  in 

comparison with the facts narrated above, brings  the 

pendulum down to the petitioner. 

10. 

The  objection  that  in  presence  of  bail 

cancellation  order  passed  by  this  Court  dated 

3.11.2017,  petitioner  cannot  ask  for  to  avail  extra 

ordinary  concession  of  pre  arrest  appears  to  be 

somewhat  harsh  because  not  only  the  referred  order 

was passed at his back but at the relevant time he was 

not  a  Proclaimed  Offender,  as  was  observed  on 

03.11.2017  rather  he  was  subsequently  declared  as 

proclaimed offender on 21.11.2017. 

 
 
 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -8- 

11. 

   There  should  be  some  difference  between 

proclaimed  offender,  who  had  remained  subject  of 

raids,  exercise  to  trace  whereabouts,  search  by 

investigating agency and finally caught, arrested due 

to  efforts  by  the  police  or  either  during  proceedings 

on  the  direction  of  the  Court,  and  one  who  himself 

voluntarily  surrenders  before  the  Court  of  law,  put 

himself  to  the  mercy  of  the  Court,  seeks  protection 

of  the  Court  and  present  himself  to  seek  assistance 

of the Court/access to justice. It amounts to denial an 

individual  to  access  to  justice  if  some  benefit  is  not 

extended  to  the  latter.  In  response  to  his  volunteer 

act  as  compared  to  the  forceful  arrest  by  the 

police/agency.  He  has  placed/put  confidence  upon 

the  administration  of  Criminal  Justice  System.  This 

Court  believes  that  one  who  wants  to  avail 

protection of criminal justice system, he should not 

be  discouraged  and  penalized  for  his  good  deed 

because finally the matter is to be dealt with by the 

Court of competent jurisdiction on merits.  

12. 

       Section  406  PPC  does  not  fall  within  the 

ambit of prohibitory clause and in the offences which 

are  not  included  in  the  ambit  of  prohibitory  clause 

grant of bail is a rule and refusal is an exception.  

13. 

         When  contents  of  FIR  are  examined  and 

the other material available on record, it appears that 

offence  could  be  in  the  nature  of  Section  403  PPC  or 

Section  420  PPC  which  are  bailable  and  in  such  like 

cases  bail  is  granted  as  matter  of  right  and  above all 

one thing becomes clear that case of the petitioner in 

 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -9- 

that  eventuality  becomes  one  of  further  inquiry  and 

when any petitioner succeeds to prove his case in the 

purview of further inquiry then he is entitled for bail 

as  a  matter  of  right  and  in  that  eventuality  even  to 

remain proclaimed offender of said accused, does not 

disentitle  him  from  the  bail  because  when  there  is  a 

context  between  further  inquiry  and  the  proclaimed 

offender for the purpose of grant of bail, then element 

of  proclaimed  offender  will  give  way  to  the  fact  of 

further  inquiry,  bail  being  matter  of  right.  In  this 

respect  I  am  benefited  by  the  Judgment  of  the  Hon’ble 

Apex Court cited as Ikram ul Haq.  VS  Raja Naveed Sabir, 

etc {2012 SCMR 1273} wherein it is held that:- 

“It  has  vehemently  been  argued  by  the  learned 
counsel for the petitioner that respondent no.1 had 
remained  a  fugitive  from  law  and  had  been 
declared  a  proclaimed  offender  and,  thus,  he  was 
not  entitled to  be  extended  the  concession  of  bail. 
We  have,  however,  remained  unable  to  subscribe 
to  this  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 
petitioner because the law is by now settled that in 
a case calling for further inquiry into the guilt of a 
accused  person  bail  is  to  be  allowed  to  him  as  a 
matter  of  right  and  not  by  way  of  grace  or 
concession.  Bail  is  sometimes  refused  to  an 
accused  person  on  account  of  his  absconsion  but 
such  refusal  of  bail  proceeds  primarily  upon  a 
question of propriety. It goes without saying that 
whenever  a  question  of  propriety  is  confronted 
with a question of right the latter must prevail.” 

14. 

The bail could not be withheld merely on 

the ground that the accused remained a fugitive from 

law  because  that  is  only  a  matter  of  propriety. 

Reliance in this respect is made to PLD 2012 (SC) 222, 

Qamar alias Mitho case. It was held that:-  

 
 
 
 
 
Criminal Misc. No. 35-B/ 2020. 

                             -10- 

“It  has  vehemently  been  argued  by  the  learned 
Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab appearing 
for  the  state  that  the  petitioner  had  remained  a 
proclaimed  offender  for  a  period  of  about  four 
years  and,  thus,  he  is  not  entitled  to  any 
indulgence  in  the  matter  of  bail.  We  have, 
however,  not  felt  persuaded  to  agree  with  the 
learned  Additional  Prosecutor  General  in  this 
regard.  It  has  already  been  held  by  this  Court  in 
the  cases  of  Ibrahim.  VS  Hayaat  Gul  and  others 
{1985  SCMR  382}  &  Muhammad  Sadiq.    VS 
Sadiq  and  others  {PLD  1985  SC  182}  that  in  a 
case  calling  for  further  inquiry  into  a  guilt  of 
accused  person,  bail  is  to  be  allowed  to  him  as  of 
right  and  such  right  cannot  be  refused  to  him 
merely  on  account  of  his  alleged  abscondence 
which is factor relevant only to propriety.”  

15. 

          In view of above, instant criminal misc. is 

allowed, petitioner Hassan Ali Raja is admitted to pre-

arrest bail subject to furnishing of fresh bail bonds in 

the  sum  of  Rs.200,000/-  (rupees  two  hundred 

thousands)  to  the  satisfaction  of  learned  Trial  Court. 

The  petitioner  is  directed  to  join  the  proceedings  of 

the  Court  of  competent  jurisdiction  where  report 

under Section 173 Cr. PC had been submitted against 

him as per law.
