Order with signature of Judge and that of parties 
or counsel where necessary.  

Applicant in person. 

Through  the  instant  CM  the  applicant  has 

prayed  for  interpretation/clarification  of  judgment/order 

dated: 01.10.2020 regarding visitation schedule.  

2.   

Petitioner  in  person  contends  that  learned 

executing  Court  has  relied  upon  the  interim  order  dated: 

01.10.2020  passed  in the  captioned  writ  petition,  despite 

the  fact  that  the  said  order  was  interim  in  nature  and  in 

the final order/judgment the entire order of the appellate 

Court was maintained.  

3.   

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  learned  Senior 

Civil Judge-III (Guardian Judge) West-Islamabad being in 

executing capacity has changed the visitation schedule as 

was decreed in favour of decree holder, which is ought to 

be  challenged  through  a  separate  constitutional  petition, 

therefore, office is directed to convert instant CM with due 

modification and number the same as writ petition.  

4.   

The petition be relisted on 26.11.2021.
