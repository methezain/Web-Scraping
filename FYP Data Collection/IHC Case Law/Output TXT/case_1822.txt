Mr. Muhammad  lftikhar Hussain  Satti, Advocate  for
petitioners.

Through  this writ petition  the petitioner  has

assailed  the order  dated 15.05.2019,  passed by learned

Additional  Sessions |udge-III (East),  Islamabad,

whereby application  U/S 491, Cr.P.C. for recovery of

minor namely Ayesha  Fatima  was dismissed.

2. 

Learned  counsel for the petitioners contends

that petitioners  are paternal  grandparents  of the minor

Ayesha  Fatima  born on 04.04.2015,  who is in custody of

respondent  No.2 Mst. Zakeeda/mother  of minor,

whereas  real father of the minor and husband of

respondent No.2 has died on 10.02.2019  as his dead

body was found near Rawal  Dem.

3. 

Learned  counsel for the petitioners has been

confronted regarding the impugned  order,  whereby it

was proposed  that question  of welfare  of minor could

only be resolved through Guardian Court concerned,

whereby  he contends  that pefitioners  have not yet

initiated  any such proceedings  and this Court  has to

adjudicate upon  the question of welfare of minor  under

W.P.  No.252212018

2

the law

4. 

Keeping in  view the above background,

respondent No.2 is real mother  of minor  namely Ayesha

Fatima,  aged about 04 years born on 04.04.2015,  as such

real mother  is natural guardian  and proper person  in

whose  custody welfare  of the minor lies, therefore,  at

this stage, claim raised by the petitioners could not be

adjudicated  upon in constitutional jurisdiction as all

these  questions could only be considered by the

concerned  Guardian  Court, if  petitioner intends to

proceed in this regard. Hence, instant petition  is

misconceived and the same is hereby dismissed in

limine.
