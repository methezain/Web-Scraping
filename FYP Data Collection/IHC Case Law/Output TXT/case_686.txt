JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. 

Writ Petition No.521 of 2022 

Muhammad Samiullah. 

VS

Judge Family Court, Islamabad-East and another. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
16.02.2022  Sheikh  Muhammad  Khizer  ur  Rashid, 

Advocate for the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  order  dated 

21.12.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

Court,  East-Islamabad,  whereby  order  for 

transfer of plot of the petitioner in the name 

of respondent No.2 has been passed. 

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  the  petitioner  is 

ready  and  willing  to  pay  the  decretal 

amount,  which 

is  Rs.11,00,000/- 

as 

mentioned  in  the  execution  petition  filed  by 

respondent No.2 but the order for transfer of 

plot  of  the  petitioner  in  the  name  of 

respondent  No.2 

is 

erroneous 

and 

unjustified; according to law the learned Trial 

Court  can  only  pass  an  order  for  auction  of 

plot  in  order  to  realize  the  decretal  amount 

and remaining amount against the auction of 

plot is liable to be returned to  the  petitioner 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
but  in  the  impugned  order  there  is  no  such 

condition,  the  plot  is  more  expensive  than 

the  decretal  amount,  hence  the  impugned 

order is liable to be set-aside.   

 3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice to respondent No.2.  

 4. 

Re-list on 24.02.2022. 

 C.M. No.01 of 2022. 

Notice.  Meanwhile,  status  quo 

shall  be  maintained  by  the  parties  till  next 

date of hearing. Restraining order shall cease 

to  exist  and  expire  automatically,  if  not 

extended  specifically  on  the  next  date  of 

hearing.  

 C.M. No.02 of 2022. 

Exemption  sought  for  is  allowed 

subject to all just and legal exceptions.
