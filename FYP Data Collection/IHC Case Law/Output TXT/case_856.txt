Date of Hearing:  13.10.2021 

AAMER  FAROOQ,  J.-  The  petitioner  namely  Azra  Khaliq 

is  widow  of Abdul  Khaliq  Awan  who  was  a  civil  servant  and 

retired  from  service  in BS-21  of Secretariat  Group.  She  claims 

for  her  husband  benefit  of  promotion 

in  BS-22  by  way  of 

proforma  promotion 

to  BS-21  w.e.f.  17.12.1988  and  BS-22 

w.e.f.  17.02.1995  when 

the  other  civil  servants 

junior 

to 

petitioner's  husband  were  promoted. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for the  petitioner,  inter alia, contended 

that  it  is  settled  law  that  the  legal  heirs  of  deceased  civil 

servants  can  claim  benefit  of proforma  promotion  even  after 

the  demise  of  the  civil  servant.  In  this  behalf  reliance  was 

placed  on  the  case  titled  Rakhshinda  Habib  v.  Federation  of 

Pakistan  and others  (2014  PLC  (C.S.)  247),  the  Matter  of 

Succession  of 

the  Assets,  Securities,  Properties  and 

Accounts  of  Late  Ja•1ed  Iqbal  Ghaznavi 

(PLD  2010 

2 

Writ  PeHHon  No.SIS  of  2018 

Karachi  153), Zaheer  Abbas  v.  Pir Asif  and  6 others  (2011 

CLC  1528), Mst.  S.  Yasmin  11.  Pakistan  Railways  and  others 

(2017 PLC  (C.S.)  1), Dr. Qamar uz Zaman  Ch.  V Sved Afzal 

Muhammad Farooq  and  others  (2005  PLC  (C.S.)  1424).  It 

was  further submitted  that the  civil  servants who  were junior 

to  petitioner's· husband  were  granted promotion  and  in  many 

cases  even  antedated  promotion  was  afforded,  hence  the 

petitioner  is  also  entitled  to  the  same  treatment  for  her 

deceased  husband  as  the  inaction  on  part  of the  respondent 

amounts  to  discrimination.  It was  added  that  in  the  earlier 

round  of  litigation  similar  prayer  was  made  and  on  the 

statement of the respondent the matter was disposed of (W.P. 

No.1823  of 2014  decided  on  10.05.2016); that  the  contempt 

application  was  filed  which  was  also  disposed  of  with  the 

observation  that  the  petitioner  may  agitate  the  matter  before 

the  competent  authority;  however,  since  the  competent 

authority has turned  down the request of the petitioner,  hence 

the petitioner  is left with no other adequate remedy except the 

relief  under  Article  199  of  Constitution  of  the  Islamic 

Republic of Pakistan,  1973. 

3. 

Learned  Deputy  Attorney-General, 

inter 

alia, 

contended  that  the  promotion  is  not  a  vested  right  and 

especially promotion  to BS-22  is only on the basis  of certain 

criteria which calls for merit. It was added that even proforma 

promotion  in  the  form  of  financial  benefits  can  only  be 

3 

Wr1t  Petition  No.515  of  2018 

granted  where  the  petitioner  has  been  denied  promotion 

without  any  fault  on his  part,  hence  it  was requested  that  the 

petition be dismissed. 

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  have  been  heard  and the  documents  placed  on  record 

examined with their able assistance. 

5. 

The grievance of the petitioner is  spelt out hereinabove. 

In  the  earlier  round  of  litigation,  by  way  of  Writ  Petition 

No.1823  of  2014,  the  petitioner  had  made  the  following 

prayer: 

"It  is,  therefore,  humbly prayed  that  by accepting 

this  Writ  Petition  with  costs  the  Respondent

list  above  the  names  of  the  above 

Petitioner who are far junior  to him being at Serial 

Nos.15,  17  and  23  respectively  in  the  seniority 

dated  13. 03.2007." 

6. 

The referred petition was disposed of on  10.05.2016 on 

the  statement  of concerned  Deputy  Secretary that  the  case of 

the  petitioner  is  in  progress  and  the  matter  shall  be  decided 

within  six  weeks.  When  the  needful  was  not  done  Criminal 

Original  was  filed  which  again  was  disposed  of.  The 

petitioner  agitated  the  matter by way  of representation  which 

has  been  turned  down  by  the  competent  authority.  Before 

embarking  to  render  opinion  on  merit,  it  is  appropriate  to 

address  the  question  as  to  the  maintainability  of the  petition 

which was raised by respondents on the basis that petitioner  is 

not civil servant in question but rather is  one of the legal heirs 

and  seeks  relief  on  behalf  of her  deceased  husband;  the  case 

law  relied  upon  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  to 

substantiate his argument that the writ petition is maintainable 

is  instructive.  In  the  recent judgment  in  case  titled  Regional 

Operation  Chie[.  National  Bank  of  Pakistan,  Human 

Resource  Department,  Regional  Office,  Sargodha  and 

others  v.  Mst.  Nusrat  Perveen  and others  (2021 SCMR  702) 

the august Apex Court observed that the service disputes were 

not always attached  merely with the person of a civil servant 

5 

Writ  Petition  No.SIS  of  2018 

as  an  individual  but  more  often  than  not  with  some  benefits 

which could  be enjoyed  by the successors of the  civil servant 

in  accordance  with  law  which  were  contingent  on  the 

adjudication of the controversy. It was added that the question 

where  after  the  death  of the  civil  servant  proceedings  would 

abate would primarily depend on the nature of cause of action 

and  the  relief  claimed  in  the  peculiar  facts  of  each  case. 

Service  benefits  may  be  enjoyed  by  the  successors  of  the 

deceased  civil  servant.  Some of those  were  inheritable which 

formed  part  of the  estate  of  the  deceased  while  others  were 

grants to be distributed  among his  family members  according 

to law. Such a claim did not extinguish with the death of civil 

servant.  The  Apex  Court  further  observed  that  under  the 

constitutional  scheme,  abatement  of the  proceedings  on  the 

death  of  a  civil  servant,  in  a  case,  where  a  cause  of action 

carries  a  survivable 

interest  would  unduly  deprive 

the 

deceased  civil  servant  as  well  as  his  legal  heirs  of  their 

constitutional  rights  to  livelihood,  property,  dignity  and  fair 

trial. Similar views were expressed by this Court in case titled 

Rakhshinda  Habib  v.  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others 

(2014  PLC  (C.S.)  247)  as  well  as Zaheer Abbas  11.  Pir Asif 

and  6  others  (2011  CLC  1528)  and  Mst.  S.  Yasmin  v. 

Pakistan Railwavs and others (2017  PLC  (C.S.)  1).  On  the 

touchstone  of the  above  case  law, the  instant  petition  by  the 

petitioner,  claiming  proforma  promotion  for  her  husband  is 

6 

Wr1t Petition No.SIS or  2018 

maintainable. 

7. 

The  thrust  of the  arguments  by  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  in  seeking  the  proforma  promotion  antedated  in 

BS-21 

and 

then  BS-22 

is  basically  on 

the  basis  of 

discrimination  on  account  of  the  fact  that  his  juniors  have 

been  so  granted. 

It  was  also  argued  vehemently 

that  the 

petitioner  was  at  serial  No.8  of  the  seniority  list  but  others 

who  had  been  granted  promotion  were  at  serial  Nos.1  l-A,  25, 

30,  31  &  32  vide  notifications  dated  27.06.2016,  25.03.2016 

&  04.10.2013.  The  said  arguments  of the  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner,  in my  opinion,  is misconceived  inasmuch  as the 

promotion 

in  the  higher  scale 

is  based  on  seniority-cum  

fitness.  The  promotion 

to  BS-21 

is  within  the  domain  of 

Central  Selection  Board  and 

in  BS-22 

the  High  Power 

Selection  Board  and  in  neither  case  it  is  as  of right.  Nothing 

has  been  mentioned  either 

in  the  writ  petition  or  in  the 

representation  by  the  petitioner  as  to  the  reasons  which 

prevailed  with 

the  competent 

authority 

in  not  granting 

promotion  to  the  petitioner  in  BS-22  rather,  the  sole  ground 

agitated 

is  discrimination 

as  juniors  have  been  granted 

promotion.  The  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  civil  servants 

who  were  junior  to  the  petitioner's  husband  and  were  granted 

proforma  promotion 

in  BS-22  and  otherwise  are  not  before 

this  Court,  hence  no  observation  can  be  made  with  respect  to 

the  same.  However,  nothing  has  been  mentioned 

in  the  writ 

7 

Wrtt  Petition  No.SIS of 2018 

petition  or  otherwise  as  to  the  reasons  which  prevailed  by 

virtue  of  which 

the  petitioner's  husband  was  denied 

promotion to BS-22. As noted above, the promotion to BS-22 

is based on certain criteria as provided under the relevant rules 

and  the  petitioner  has  not  shown  as  to  whether  her  husband 

was  considered  and  not  recommended  for  promotion  or 

otherwise  the  facts and circumstances which deprived  him  of 

his promotion. Though the request to be considered under FR- 

17  for  proforma  promotion  for  the  purpose  of  financial 

benefits  is  after the  retirement  but the  criteria for the  same is 

whether  the  civil  servant  was  denied  promotion  without  any 

fault  of his  and  mere  discrimination  or  the  promotion  of the 

juniors  cannot  form the yardstick for grant of similar relief to 

any civil servant. In this behalf the relevant provision is FR  17 

( 1) which reads as under: 

"FR-17(1)  subject  to  any  exceptions  specifically 
made  in these rules and  to the provisions  of sub-rule  (2), 
an  officer  shall  begin  to  draw  the  pay  and  allowances 
attached  to  his  tenure of a post  with  effect from  the date 
when he assumes the duties of that post  and shall cease to 
draw  them  as  soon  as  he  ceases  to  discharge  those 
duties', 

[Provided  that  the  appointing  authority  may,  if satisfied, 
that a civil savant who was entitled to be promoted from  a 
particular  ate  was, for  no fault  of  this  own,  wrongfully 
prevented from  rendering service to the Federation  in the 
higher post,  direct  that such  civil  servants  shall  be paid 
the  arrears  of pay  and  allowances  of such  higher  post 
through  proforma  promotion  or  up-gradation  arising 
from  the ante-dated fixation  of his seniority].

This  Court  in  case  titled  The  Prime  Minister  and  others 

VS Maj.  Retd.  Mohammad  Habib  Khan  {2016 PLC  (C.S.) 

621}  lucidly  examined  the  law  of  FR  1 7  and  observed  as

conditions prescribed  in  the proviso  to FR-

service to the Federation in a higher post for
