MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J :-  Through  this 

judgment,  I  propose  to  decide  writ  petitions  No.194,  932,  1146, 

1158,  1212,  1425,  1471,  1486,  1520,  1800  (to  the  extent  of 

petitioner  No.  3),  1851,  2216,  2242,  2447,  2634,  and  2677  of 

2020,  since  they entail certain  common  features. 

2. 

All  the  petitioners  have  been  serving  as  teachers  in  the 

Federal  Directorate  of  Education  (“F.D.E.”)  on  deputation  basis 

for  several  years.  They  have  assailed  notifications  issued  by  the 

F.D.E.  whereby  they  were  repatriated  to  their  respective  parent 

departments.  In  essence,  the  petitioners‟  case  is  that  since  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

F.D.E.  had  initiated  a  process  of  the  petitioners‟  absorption  in 

the  F.D.E.  and  since 

the  petitioners‟  respective  parent 

departments  had  issued  No  Objection Certificates (“N.O.C.”) for 

the  their  absorption,  they  had  acquired  a  vested  right  and  had  a 

legitimate expectation  for their  absorption  in the F.D.E.   

3. 

The  challenge  to 

the  orders 

for  the  repatriation  of 

deputationists  serving  in  the  F.D.E.  have  consumed  precious 

public  time  of  this  Court.  The  root  cause  of  this  litigation  is  the 

policy  of  'pick  and  choose'  adopted  by  the  officials  in  the  F.D.E. 

and 

its  controlling  Ministry 

in  making  appointments  on 

deputation  and  absorption  of  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  The 

voluminous  documents  brought  on  record  by  the  contesting 

parties  to  this  litigation  indicate  that  appointments on deputation 

in  the  F.D.E.  had  been  made  not  on  merit  but  through means that 

are  abhorrent  to  a  transparent  method  of  appointment  or 

posting against  posts in the service  of the Federation.   

FACTUAL BACKGROUND:- 

4. 

Apparently, 

in  the  year  1998 

lady  teachers  taken  on 

deputation  in  the  F.D.E  from  Provincial  education  departments 

were  repatriated  to  their  respective  parent  departments  after 

the  expiry  of  the  maximum  permissible  deputation  period  of  five 

years.  These  teachers  filed  a  writ  petition  before  the  Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench  challenging 

their 

repatriation  orders.  Initially,  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  suspended 

the  repatriation  orders  but  subsequently  the  writ  petition  was 

dismissed.  The  order  passed  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

was  assailed  by  the  lady  teachers  before  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court.  Vide  order  dated  04.12.1998,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

disposed of the petition inter alia in the  following terms:- 

“In our view, it will be appropriate if no further action is taken 
against the petitioners for a period of three months. In the 
meantime,  if  some  action  is  taken  pursuant  upon  above 
[O.M.No.10/1/84-R-5,  dated  26.11.1998]  the  same may  be 
implemented,  otherwise  they  will  be  repatriated  to  their 
respective Provinces. Petitions are disposed of in the above 
terms.” 

5.  When  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  passed  the  said  order,  the 

recruitment  rules  of  the  F.D.E.  did  not  have  any  provision  for 

 
 
 
3 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

appointment  by  transfer  or  absorption  of  deputationists.  Therefore, 

vide  letter  (FDE,  U.O.No.F.4-9/98(W))  dated  02.12.1998,  the  F.D.E. 

submitted  a  case  for  amendment  in  its  recruitment  rules  to  make 

room 

for  absorbing  deputationists  on  permanent  basis.  The 

recruitment  rules  of  the  F.D.E.  were  amended  by  placing  10%  posts 

of  Trained  Under  Graduate  Teachers  (“TUGT”)  (BPS-14)  and  Matric 

Trained  Teachers  (“MTT”)  (BPS-09)  for appointment by transfer. This 

was  done  through  notification  dated  18.02.1999  issued  pursuant  to 

Rule  3(2)  of  the  Civil  Servants  (Appointment,  Promotion  and 

Transfer) Rules, 1973 (“the A.P.T. Rules”) by the erstwhile Ministry of 

Education,  whereby  the  recruitment  rules  of  the  F.D.E.  set  out  in  the 

notification  (SRO  No.196(KE)/92)  dated  16.07.1992  were  amended  to 

provide  for  50%  of  the  posts  of  TUGT  (BPS-14)  in  the  F.D.E.  to  be 

filled  by  promotion;  40%  by  initial  appointment;  and  10%  by  transfer. 

The  said  notification  also  made  provision  for  90%  of the posts of MTT 

(BPS-09)  in  the  F.D.E.  to be filled through initial appointment and 10% 

by  transfer.  The  said  notification  was  issued  after  obtaining  the 

concurrence  of the Establishment  Division.  

6. 

For  the  absorption  of  deputationists,  the  F.D.E.,  on  23.01.2000, 

proposed  the following criteria:- 

“(i)     N.O.C. of his/her parent department for absorption under the 

Federal Government. 

iii) 

ii)  The deputationist(s) must possess the requisite academic and 
professional qualification and fulfill the conditions of Division 
as notified in the Recruitment Rule. 
In the light of Prime Minister‟s Directive, 1st priority is to be 
given to those whose husbands are Federal Govt. employees 
and their services are not transferable to the stations of 
posting of their spouses, i.e.  wives. Cases of those whose 
parents/brothers/sisters are settled in Islamabad may be 
considered by the Departmental Selection Committee if so 
desired. 

iv)  Length of service of the deputationist(s) under the Federal 
Government.  Absorption  may  only  be  considered  after 
completion of the maximum period, availability of the post 
against 10% quota of the cadre to which he/she belongs. 
v)  Consent/Affidavit to the effect that in case of absorption 
he/she will claim seniority from the date of absorption and not 
from retrospective effect. 

vi)  Those  who  have  already  been  repatriated  will  not  be 

considered for absorption.” 

7. 

On  24.01.2000,  the  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Education,  approved 

the said criterion.

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

8.  With  effect  from  01.01.2011,  the  post  of  MTT  was  upgraded 

from  BPS-09  to  BPS-14  and  re-designated  as  Elementary  School 

Teacher  (“EST")  whereas  the  post  of  TUGT was upgraded from BPS-

14  to  BPS-16  and  re-designated  as  Trained  Graduate  Teacher 

(“TGT”).  After  the  said  upgradation  of  posts  was  carried  out,  the 

recruitment  rules  of  the  F.D.E.  were  again  amended  vide  notification 

(SRO  338(I)/2011)  dated  30.03.2011  which  provided  for  the  method 

of  appointment  to  the  post  of  EST  to  be  90%  by  initial  appointment 

and 10% by transfer.   

9. 

The  postings  on  deputation  basis 

in  the  F.D.E.  and  the 

continuation  of  such  postings  beyond  a  period  of  five  years  was 

deprecated  by  this  Court  in  its  judgment  in  the  case  of  Asma 

Shaheen  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2013  PLC  (C.S.)  391)  in  the 

following terms:- 

“16.    It  is  observed  with  great  concern  that  some  of  the 
petitioners/deputationists are still working in borrowing department 
despite expiry of deputation period a few years ago, which is 
contrary  to  law,  settled  rules,  against  the  principle  of  good 
governance and the same is also careless, callous, indifferent 
approach of the petitioners and both the concerned departments i.e. 
borrowing department and parent department. The same has been 
done in connivance with each other. This Court cannot close its eyes 
to such glaring illegalities and irregularities due to which certain 
other officials who are waiting for their deputation under wedlock 
policy in Islamabad have been deprived of their legal right. These 
illegalities, irregularities and violation of rules cannot be ignored.” 

10. 

In  order  to  ensure  that  the  public  functionaries  responsible  for 

violating  the  requirement  of  repatriating  deputationists  upon  the 

completion  of  the  maximum  permissible  deputation  period  are 

appropriately  dealt  with,  and  for  there  to  be  a  mechanism  prescribed 

in  the  form  of  rules  for  the  absorption  of  deputationists,  this  Court 

gave the following directions:- 

“Therefore, it is directed that a fact finding committee shall be 
constituted  by  the  Director  General,  Federal  Directorate  of 
Education, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, who shall fix the 
responsibility of officers/officials who were responsible to take action 
for repatriation of deputationists who had completed their stipulated 
period and had not been repatriated except in those cases, in which 
courts had granted status quo order at the time of completion of 
maximum  period  and  after  determining  such  responsible 
officers/officials strict disciplinary action shall be taken against those 
delinquent officers/officers after inquiry in accordance with law. 
17.      It  is  also  surprising  to  note  that  for  the  absorption  of 
deputationists no hard and fast rule has been provided in law, and 
the matter has been left at the mercy and discretion of the competent 

 
 
5 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

authority, which is creating untoward situation. Therefore, Ministry of 
Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs is suggested to examine the 
matter and frame specific rules/criteria regarding absorption of 
deputationists on permanent basis.” 

11.  After  taking 

into  consideration  the  said  observations  and 

directions  of  this  Court,  the  Director  General,  F.D.E.,  on  29.11.2011, 

gave  instructions  to  repatriate  the  deputationists  who  had  completed 

the  maximum  permissible  deputation  period  of 

five  years. 

Additionally,  it  was  decided  to  constitute  a  fact-finding  committee  to 

fix  responsibility  for  the  delay  in  the  repatriation  of  deputationists 

who  had  completed  five  years  of  deputation.  On  19.12.2011,  a  three-

member  fact-finding  committee,  comprising  of  (1)  Chairman,  Private 

Educational  Institutions  Regulatory  Authority,  (2)  Director  (A&C), 

F.D.E.  and  (3)  Deputy  Director  (Legal),  F.D.E.,  was  constituted  to 

“probe into the matter in the light of decision/judgment of IHC.” I  am 

told  by  the  representatives  of  the  F.D.E.  that  no  session  of  this 

committee  ever 

took  place.  No 

inquiry  was  conducted;  no 

responsibility  was  fixed  on  any  delinquent  officer;  and  obviously,  no 

action  was  taken  against  anyone.  This  shows  the  scant  regard  that 

the  officials  in  the  F.D.E.  and  its  controlling  Ministry  had  for  the 

observations  and directions  passed by this Court. 

12.  Rule  20A  of  the  APT  Rules  provides  inter alia  that  appointment 

on  deputation  can  be  for  a  period  not  exceeding  three  years  which 

may  be  extended  for  another  period  of  two  years  on  such  terms  and 

conditions  as  may  be  sanctioned  by  the  Federal  Government  in 

consultation  with the lending organization. 

13.  The  Establishment  Secretary  vide 

letter  (Estab.  Div.  U.O. 

No.10/30/97-R-II)  dated  27.02.2012  had  proposed  to  the  Prime 

Minster  that  a proviso  to  Rule  20A  of the APT Rules may be inserted in 

order  to  exempt  female  government  servants  posted  to  Islamabad 

under  the  wedlock  policy  from the applicability of Rule 20A of the APT 

Rules.  The  said  proposal  was  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  on 

24.03.2012.  Thereafter,  vide  notification  (SRO  375(I)/2012)  dated 

16.04.2012  issued  by  the  Establishment  Division,  a  proviso  to  Rule 

20A  of  the  APT  Rules  was  inserted.  In  order  to  perpetuate  the  tenure 

of  deputationists  whose  spouses  were  residing  at  Islamabad  beyond 

the  maximum  deputation  period  of  five  years,  a  proviso  was  inserted 

 
6 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

to  Rule  20A  of  the  APT  Rules.  For  the  purposes  of  clarity,  the proviso 

to  Rule  20A  of  the  APT  Rules  inserted  through  the  said  notification  is 

reproduced  herein  below:- 

“Provided that posting of serving husband and wife at the same 
station, unmarried female government servants at the place of 
residence  of  their  parents/family  and  that  of  married  female 
government servants at the place of residence/posting of their 
husbands who are not in government employment shall be exempted 
from the said rule.” 

14.  As  a  consequence  of  the  said  proviso  having  been  inserted  in 

Rule  20A  of  the  APT  Rules,  the  erstwhile  Ministry  of  Capital 

Administration  and  Development  (the  then  controlling  Ministry  of  the 

F.D.E.)  vide  letter  dated  09.05.2012  requested  the  Director  General, 

F.D.E. 

to  withdraw 

the 

repatriation  orders 

issued 

to 

the 

deputationists  and  to  process  their  cases  for  the  release  of  their 

salaries.   

15.  The  F.D.E.  had  taken  the  services  of  a  number  of  teaching  and 

non-teaching  staff  on  deputation  basis  under  the  wedlock  policy  of 

the  government,  keeping  in  view  the  socio-economic  problems 

faced  by  husbands  and  wives  in  government  service  due  to  posting 

at  different  stations.  On  08.03.2013,  the  Ministry  of  Capital 

Administration  and  Development  moved  a  summary  for  the  Prime 

Minister  proposing  that  “all the deputationists (teaching and non-

teaching)  working  in  the  educational  institutions  under  FDE, 

Islamabad on deputation basis under Wedlock Policy and completed 

their 05 years of deputation may be absorbed in their respective 

cadres.”  In  the  said  summary,  it  was  also  proposed  that  the 

absorption  of  the  incumbents  shall  be  subject  to  the  provisions  in 

the 

recruitment 

rules 

and 

be 

effected 

after 

the 

fulfillment/completion  of  all  the  codal/procedural  formalities  as 

contained  in  the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973.  On  08.03.2013,  the  said 

proposal  was  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister.  Vide  letter  dated 

16.03.2013,  the  Ministry  of  Capital  Administration  and  Development 

conveyed  the  said  decision  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  the  Director 

General,  F.D.E.  and  asked  for  certain  information  so  that  the 

process  for  the  absorption  of  the  deputationists  could  be  initiated. 

Thereafter,  the  F.D.E.  started  the  process  of  completing  the  annual 

confidential  reports  of  the  female  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  The 

 
 
7 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

F.D.E.  also  requested  the  parent  departments  of  the  deputationists 

to provide NOCs  for their  permanent  absorption  in the F.D.E.   

16.  Vide  letter  dated  11.11.2014,  the  Capital  Administration  and 

Development  Division  solicited  the  advice  of  the  Establishment 

Division  regarding  the  absorption  of  teachers  in  the  F.D.E.  under the 

wedlock  policy  “as  one  time  dispensation.”  Vide  Office 

Memorandum  ("O.M.")  dated  13.11.2014,  the  Establishment  Division 

informed  the  Secretary,  Capital  Administration  and  Development 

Division as to the following:- 

“a)  Legal framework for appointments has been provided in the 
Civil Servants Act, 1973 and under Section 5 of the Civil 
Servants Act, 1973 the appointments are required to be made 
in the prescribed manner.  

b)  Specific methods of appointment(s), qualifications and other 
conditions applicable to a post(s) are required to be laid 
down in the form of Recruitment Rules of the post(s) under 
sub-rule  (2)  of  rule  3  of  Civil  Servants  (Appointment, 
Promotion & Transfer), 1973 by the Ministry or Division 
concerned in consultation with the Establishment Division.  

c)  The Authorities competent to make appointments for various 
posts have been prescribed under rule 6 of the Civil Servants 
(Appointment, Promotion & Transfer) Rules, 1973 and such 
Authorities upto the post in BS-19 & below borne on the 
cadre  strength  of  the  Ministries/Divisions  are  in  the 
respective Ministries/Divisions.” 

17.  Letter  dated  25.11.2014  from  the  Capital  Administration  and 

Development  Division  shows  that  the  Secretary  of  the  said  Division  

had  approved  the  absorption  /  induction  of  deputationists  serving  in 

BPS-01  to  BPS-15  in  the  educational  institutions  under  the  F.D.E. 

through  a  departmental  promotion  committee  subject  to  the 

recruitment  rules  and  completion  of  the  codal  formalities.  It  was 

also  mentioned  that  the  absorption 

/ 

induction  was  to  be  in 

accordance  with the  seniority  of the deputationists. 

18.  Vide  office  order  dated  10.12.2014,  the  F.D.E.  constituted  a 

six-member  committee  to  examine  all  the  cases  of  deputationists 

(teaching  and  non-teaching)  working  under  the  F.D.E.  for  their 

absorption.  The  primary  task  of  this  committee  was  to  scrutinize  the 

particulars  of  only  those  deputationists  working  under  the  wedlock 

policy  who  had  completed  five  years  of  service,  for  consideration 

for  absorption  in  the  F.D.E.  Vide  office  order  dated  17.02.2015,  the 

said  committee  was  re-constituted  to  reduce  its  composition  to  two 

members  only.  Vide  office  order  dated  22.05.2017,  the  F.D.E.

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

constituted  yet  another  committee  comprising  of  five  members  to 

examine  the cases  of deputationists  working  under  the F.D.E.   

19.  Letter  dated  16.01.2014  from  the  Capital  Administration  and 

Development  Division  shows  that  a  ban  had  been  imposed  on 

deputation,  induction,  absorption,  and  appointment  by  transfer  in 

the  said  Division  and  its  attached  departments,  autonomous  bodies, 

subordinate  offices  and  all  other  affiliated  organizations  under  the 

administrative  control  of  the  said  Division  till  the  completion  of  the 

recruitment  process.  Vide  letter  dated  12.02.2015,  the  F.D.E.  was 

informed  about  the  decision  taken  by  the  Secretary,  Capital 

Administration  and  Development  Division 

to  approve 

the 

continuation  of  the  process  of  scrutinizing  cases  regarding  all 

deputationists  (teaching  and  non-teaching)  (BPS-01  to  BPS-15) 

working 

in 

the  educational 

institutions  under 

the  F.D.E.  on 

deputation  basis  under  the  wedlock  policy  and  who  had  completed 

five  years  of  deputation  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the  recruitment 

rules  and  after  the  fulfillment  of  codal  /  procedural  formalities  under 

the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  in  pursuance  of  the  Prime  Minister‟s 

approval. 

20.  Vide  letter  dated  08.04.2016,  the  F.D.E.  asked  the  Assistant 

Education  Officers  to  direct  the  54  deputationists  (named  in  the  list 

attached  with  the  said  letter)  working  in  educational  institutions 

under  the  F.D.E.  to  provide  documents  for  further  process  of  their 

cases  for permanent  absorption.   

21.  Vide  office  order  No.F.1-1/2017/W/FDE  dated  22.05.2017,  the 

F.D.E.  constituted  yet  another  five-member  committee  to  examine 

the  cases  of  teaching  and  non-teaching  deputationists  working 

under  the  F.D.E.  The  minutes  of  the  meeting  of  this  committee, 

brought  on  record  by  the  F.D.E.,  show  that  the  said  committee  had 

recommended  34  deputationists  serving  as  teachers  in  BPS-14  to 

be  considered 

for  absorption  after 

the  verification  of 

their 

qualifications. 

It  was  also  recommended 

that 

the  remaining 

deputationists  serving 

in  pay  scales  below  BPS-16,  who  had 

completed  five  years  of  deputation  period  by  31.05.2017,  be  asked 

to  provide  NOCs  from  their  parent  departments  so  that  their  cases 

could  be  processed.  There  is  nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that  the

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

said 

recommendations  were  accepted. 

It  was 

in 

these 

circumstances  that  the  repatriation  orders  under  challenge  before 

this  Court  were  issued.  The  details  of  each  of  the  petitions  are  set 

out in "Schedule-A" hereto.  

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE 
PETITIONERS:- 

22.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  after  narrating  the  facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  petitions,  submitted  that  the  petitioners 

have  served  as  deputationists  for  more  than  five  years  in  the 

schools  and  colleges  under  the  control  of  the  F.D.E.;  that  upon 

completion  of  the  maximum  deputation  period  of  five  years  the 

petitioners  acquired  a  vested  right  to  be  absorbed  in  the F.D.E.; that 

the  Prime  Minister  had  also  approved 

the  absorption  of 

deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  subject  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  codal 

formalities  under 

the  recruitment  rules;  that  the  F.D.E.  had 

expressed 

its 

intention 

to 

the  petitioners‟  respective  parent 

departments  to  absorb  the  petitioners  in  the  F.D.E.;  that  in  response 

to 

the  F.D.E.‟s 

request, 

the  petitioners‟ 

respective  parent 

departments  had  issued  NOCs  for  their  absorption  in  the  F.D.E.; that 

upon  the  issuance  of  such  NOCs  by  the  petitioners‟  respective 

parent  departments,  their  lien  with  their  parent  departments  had 

terminated;  and  that  if  the  petitioners‟  repatriation  orders  are  not 

set-aside,  they  would be rendered  jobless. 

23.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  further  submitted  that  the 

spirit  of  the  wedlock  policy  would  be  violated  if  the  petitioners were 

repatriated  to  their  respective  parent  departments  while  their 

spouses  were  working  or  living  at  Islamabad;  that  by  virtue  of  the 

proviso  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules,  the  petitioners  had  a  right  to 

remain  on  deputation  until  their  retirement  or  until  their  spouses 

worked  and 

lived  at 

Islamabad; 

that  given 

the  petitioners‟ 

experience  of  working  as  teachers  in  the  F.D.E.,  they  were  best 

suited  for  absorption  in  the  F.D.E.;  that  the  F.D.E.  and  its  controlling 

Ministry  were  deliberately  delaying  the  process  for  the  petitioners‟ 

absorption  in  the  F.D.E.;  and  that  until  the  process  initiated  by  the 

F.D.E.  for  the  petitioners‟  absorption  was  completed,  they  could  not 

have  been  repatriated  to  their  respective  parent  departments.

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the 

repatriation  orders,  and  for  a  direction  to  be 

issued  for  the 

petitioners‟  absorption  in the F.D.E.   

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  ASSISTANT  ATTORNEY - 
GENERAL:- 
24.  The  learned  Assistant  Attorney-General,  assisted  by  Mr.  Saqib 

Shahab,  Director  (P  &  D)  F.D.E.  and  Mr.  S.M.  Rehan  Naqvi,  Assistant 

Director  (Legal),  F.D.E.,  submitted  that  all  the  posts  in  the  F.D.E. 

could  only  be  filled  in  accordance  with  the  method  of  appointment 

provided  in  the  recruitment  rules  set  out  in  the  notifications  (SRO 

338(I)/2011)  dated  30.03.2011  and 

(S.R.O.  373(I)/2019)  dated 

15.03.2019;  that  a  deputationist  cannot  be  appointed  against  a  post 

which,  according  to  the  recruitment  rules,  is  required  to  be  filled  by 

promotion  or  initial  appointment;  that  the  recruitment  rules  only 

provide  for  10%  of  the  sanctioned  posts  of  EST  (BPS-14)  to  be  filled 

by  appointment  through  transfer;  that  unless  the  recruitment  rules 

provide 

for  appointment  by  transfer  to  a  particular  post,  a 

deputationist  cannot  be  absorbed  against  such  a  post;  that  the 

appointment  of  deputationists 

in  the  F.D.E.  had  blocked  the 

promotion  of  several  deserving  candidates  for  promotion;  that  none 

of  the  petitioners  had  been  appointed  on  deputation  after  a  process 

of  selection;  that  the  petitioners  had  applied  for  appointment  on 

deputation  basis  in  the  F.D.E.;  that  the  petitioners  had  been  given 

the  benefit  under  the  proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  by 

allowing  them  to  continue  serving  on  deputation  basis  after  the 

expiry  of  the  maximum  deputation  period  of  five  years;  that  there  is 

no  provision  in  pari materia  to  the proviso to  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T. 

Rules  in  the  Provincial  service  rules  which  govern  the  terms  and 

conditions  of  the  petitioners;  that  the  Provincial  Governments  can 

seek  the  repatriation  of  the  petitioners  notwithstanding  the  insertion 

of  the  proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules;  and  that  since  the 

petitioners  have  not  been  absorbed  in  the  F.D.E.  at  any  stage,  their 

lien with their  respective  parent  departments  is intact. 

25.  Furthermore, 

the 

learned  Assistant  Attorney-General 

submitted  that  the  petitioners  cannot  be  termed  as  „aggrieved 

persons‟  to  file  a  writ  petition  to  challenge  their  repatriation  to  their 

 
11 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

parent  departments;  that  a  deputationist  has  no  vested  right  to 

complete  the  deputation  period  or  to  be  absorbed  in  the  borrowing 

department;  that  a  deputationist  cannot  claim  to  have  a  preferential 

right  over  the  other  candidates  who  can  be  appointed  by  transfer  to 

the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14);  that  the  wedlock  policy  cannot  override 

the  law  laid  down  by  the  Superior  Courts  regarding  the  principles 

governing  the  repatriation  of  deputationists;  that  there  is  not  a 

single  judicial  precedent  where  the  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its 

jurisdiction  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  has  interfered  with 

an  order  for  the  repatriation  of  deputationists;  and  that  with  the 

issuance  of  the  orders  for  the  repatriation  of  the  petitioners,  their 

request  for  absorption  in  the  F.D.E.  stands  turned  down.  Learned 

Assistant  Attorney-General  prayed  for  the  writ  petitions  to  be 

dismissed.   

26. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  as  well  as  the  learned  Assistant  Attorney-General  and 

have  perused  the  record  with  their  able  assistance.  The  facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petitions  have  been  set  out  in 

sufficient  detail 

in  "Schedule-A"  below,  and  need  not  be 

recapitulated. 

WHETHER  A  PROCESS  OF  SELECTION  IS  NECESSARY  FOR 
APPOINTMENT ON DEPUTATION:- 

27.  Section  1(2)  of  the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  provides  that  the 

said  Act  shall  apply  to  all  civil  servants  wherever  they  may  be. 

Under  Section  2(b)(i)  of  the  said  Act,  a  person  who  is  on  deputation 

to  the  Federation  from  any  Province  or  other  Authority  has  been 

excluded  from  the  definition  of  the  term  “civil  servant.”  The  term 

“deputation”  has  neither  been  defined  in  the  Civil  Servants  Act, 

1973  nor  in  any  of  the  rules  made  thereunder.  In the cases of  Islamic 

Republic  of  Pakistan  VS 

Israr  ul  Haq  (PLD  1981  S.C.  531), 

Muhammad  Arshad  Sultan,  Section  Officer,  Cabinet  Division  VS 

Prime  Minister  of  Pakistan,  Islamabad  (PLD  1996  SC  771)  and 

Province  of  Punjab  VS  Ikram-ul-Haq  (1986  SCMR  1994),  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  referred  to  and  endorsed  the  meaning  given  to  the 

term  “deputation” 

in  Chapter  IX  of  the  Establishment  Manual, 

 
12 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

Volume  I  (O&M),  and  Serial  No.29  of  the  Establishment  Code  (1989 

Edition) which  is reproduced  herein  below:- 

“Hitherto, the term “deputation” has not been formally defined. 
However, according to the practice in vogue a Government Servant 
begins to be regarded as a “deputationist” when he is appointed or 
transferred, through the process of selection, to a post in a 
department or service altogether different from the one to which he 
permanently belongs. He continues to be placed in this category so 
long as he holds the new post in an officiating or a temporary 
capacity but ceases to be regarded as such either on confirmation 
in the new post or on reversion to his substantive post.” 
(Emphasis added) 

28.  This  is  the  definition  of  the  term  “deputation”  accepted  by  the 

Superior  Courts.  In  the  case  of  Province  of  Punjab  VS  Ikram-ul-

Haq(supra),  it  was  held  inter alia  that  the  said  interpretation  of  the 

term  “deputation”  has  the  effect  of  a  statutory  rule.  It  was  also  held 

that  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  had  accepted  the  said  definition  of 

the  term  “deputation”  in  the  case  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  VS 

Israr  ul Haq(supra). 

29. 

In  the  case  reported  as  2013 SCMR 1752  (In  the  matter  of 

Contempt  Proceedings  against  Chief  Secretary  Sindh  and  Others), 

the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  observed  inter alia  that  the  issue  of 

deputation  has  created  a  lot  of  unrest  amongst  the  civil  servants.  In 

the  said  judgment,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  referred  to  the 

meaning  of  the  term  “deputation”  given  at  Serial  No.29  in  Chapter-III 

of  the  Establishment  Code  (2009  Edition),  which  meaning  is  exactly 

the  same  as  the  one  at  Serial  No.29  of  the  Establishment  Code  (1989 

Edition).   

30. 

In 

the  case  of  Rasheed  Tareen  VS  Chairman  Workers 

Welfare  Board,  Balochistan  (2012  PLC  (C.S.)  54),  the  Division 

Bench  of the  Balochistan  High  Court  held  as  follows:- 

“…. a deputationist is a government servant, who is appointed 
or transferred through the process of selection to a post in a 
department  or  service altogether different from the one to 
which he permanently belongs. Such a government servant 
continues to enjoy his status so long as he holds the new post 
in  an  officiating  or  temporary  capacity  but  seizes  to  be 
regarded, as such, either on confirmation/absorption in the 
new post or on reversion to his substantive post.” 
(Emphasis added)  

31.  The  requirement  for  there  to  be  a  process  of  selection  i.e. 

advertisement,  test  and  interview  before  making  an  appointment  by 

 
13 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

deputation  in  the  F.D.E.  becomes  all  the  more  necessary  since  apart 

from  Islamabad  being  the  most  preferred  station  of  posting,  a 

deputationist  serving  in  the  F.D.E.  is  paid  deputation  allowance  at 

the  rate  of  20%  of  the  relevant  basic  pay  by  virtue  of  Finance 

Division‟s  O.M.  No.F.5(8)R-II/2007  dated  04.07.2007.  The  learned 

Assistant  Attorney-General,  after 

taking 

instructions 

from  the 

representatives  of  the  F.D.E.,  confirmed  that  for  the  first  five  years 

of  service  on  deputation,  the  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  had  been 

paid  deputation  allowance  at  the  rate  of  20%  of  their  basic  pay.  In 

addition  to  deputation  allowance,  the  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E. 

are  also being paid teaching  allowance.   

32.  Given  the  said  definition  of  the  term  “deputation”  accepted  by 

the  Superior  Courts  since  the  past  few  decades, it is safe to hold that 

a  person  cannot  be  appointed  on  deputation  unless  he  or  she  has 

been  subjected  to  a  process  of  selection.  An  appointment  of  an 

officer  on  deputation  basis  would  be  void  if  such  appointment  is  not 

preceded  by  a  process  of  selection  of  the  officer  in  question.  The 

deputationists  serving  in  the  F.D.E.  who  have  not  been  appointed 

after  a  process  of  selection  have  no  right  to  continue  serving  as 

deputationists  much  less  to  be  considered  for  absorption  in  the 

F.D.E.  Furthermore,  the  competent  authority  in  the  F.D.E.  shall  be 

failing 

in 

its  duty 

if  such  deputationists  are  not 

immediately 

repatriated  to their  respective  parent  departments.   

WHETHER A PERSON CAN BE APPOINTED BY TRANSFER TO ANY 
POST  IN  THE  F.D.E.  OTHER  THAN  THE  POST  OF  ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL TEACHER (BPS-14):- 

33.  The  A.P.T.  Rules  were  made  by  the  President  of  Pakistan  in 

exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  Section  25  of  the  Civil  Servants 

Act,  1973.  Rule  3(2)  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  provides  that  the  method  of 

appointment  and  qualifications  and  other  conditions  applicable  to  a 

post  shall  be  laid  down  by  the  Ministry  or  Division  concerned  in 

consultation  with  the  Establishment  Division.  In  pursuance  of  Rule 

3(2)  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules,  the  erstwhile  Ministry  of  Education  (which 

had  administrative  control  over  the  F.D.E.),  issued  notification  (SRO 

No.88(KE)/92)  dated  25.03.1992  setting  out  the  recruitment  rules  for 

appointment  to posts  in BPS-16  to BPS-20  in the F.D.E.   

 
 
14 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

34.  The  F.D.E.‟s  recruitment  rules,  as  amended  vide  notification 

(SRO  338(I)/2011)  dated  30.03.2011  issued  by  the  erstwhile  Ministry 

of  Education  provide  for  the  method  of  appointment  to  the  post  of 

EST  (BPS-14)  to  be  90%  by  initial  appointment  and  10%  by  transfer. 

In  other  words,  the  said  recruitment  rules  provided  a  quota  of  10% 

for  appointment  by  transfer  for  the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14)  only.  No 

quota  for  appointment  by  transfer  was  reserved  for  any  other  post  of 

teaching  and  non-teaching  staff  in  the  F.D.E.  The  said  notification 

also  provided  for  the  method  of  appointment  to  the  post  of  Sub-

Librarian  (BPS-15)  to  be  50%  by  promotion  and  50%  by  initial 

appointment.  Paragraph  6  of  the  said  notification  provides  that 

appointment  by  transfer  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions  of  Rule 7 and 9 of the A.P.T.  Rules.   

35. 

In  the  said  notification,  it  was  also  provided  that  if  no  suitable 

person  is  available  for  promotion,  the  post  or  posts  reserved  for 

promotion  shall  be  filled  by  initial  appointment  and,  failing  that,  by 

transfer.  Consequently,  appointment  by  transfer  to  the  post  of  Sub-

Librarian  (BPS-15)  can  be  made  only  if  the  F.D.E.  is  satisfied,  after 

considering  all  eligible  persons  for  promotion,  that  there  is  no 

person  available  who  is  fit  or  suitable  for  promotion  to  the  said  post 

and  the  process  initiated  for  appointment  to  the  said  post  by  initial 

appointment  did not  result in the selection  of a suitable candidate. 

36.  As  mentioned  above,  the  method  of  appointment  to  the posts of 

EST  (BPS-14)  and  Sub-Librarian  (BPS-15)  in  the  F.D.E.  is  set  out  in 

the  said  notification  dated  30.03.2011.  The  method  of  appointment  to 

posts  in  BPS-16  and  above  in  the  F.D.E.  is  set  out  in  the  notification 

(S.R.O.  373(I)/2019)  dated  15.03.2019  issued  by  the  Ministry  of 

Federal  Education  and  Professional  Training  (the  successor  of  the 

Ministry  of  Capital  Administration  and  Development)  in  exercise  of 

the  powers  conferred  by  Rule  3(2)  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  and  Section  7 

(1)(b)(i)  and  (ii)  of  the  Federal  Public  Service  Commission  Ordinance,

In  the  said  notification  dated  15.03.2019,  it  is  provided  that  if 

no  suitable  person  is  available  for  promotion,  the  post  or  posts 

reserved  for  promotion  shall  be  filled  by  initial  appointment  and 

failing  that  by  transfer.  Paragraph  5  of  the  said  notification  provides 

that  appointment  by  transfer  shall  be  made  by  selection  from 

amongst  the  persons  holding  appointment  on  regular  basis  under 

the  Federal  Government  in  the  same  basic  pay  scale  in  which  the 

post  to  be  filled  exists,  provided  that  the  person  concerned 

possesses  the  qualifications  and  experience  prescribed  for  initial 

appointment  to  the  post  concerned.  Since  none  of  the  petitioners 

are  “holding  appointment  on  regular  basis  under  the  Federal 

Government”  they  are  not  eligible  for  appointment  by  transfer  to any 

of the posts in BPS-16  and above  in the  F.D.E.   

38.  Appointments  to  posts  in  BPS-16  and  above  in  the  F.D.E.  can 

be  made  only  in  accordance  with  the  method  of  appointment 

prescribed  in  the  said  notification  dated  15.03.2019  and  no  other.  In 

the  case  of  Muhammad  Ali  VS  Province  of  KPK  (2012  SCMR  673),  it 

has  been  held  inter alia  that  the  principles  of  good  governance 

required  every  appointment  in  government  service  to  be  made  in 

accordance  with  the  relevant  rules  and  completion  of  codal 

formalities.  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  Syed  Mubashir  Raza  Jaffari 

VS  Employees  Old-Age  Benefits  Institution  (2014  SCMR  949),  it  has 

been  held  inter alia  that  appointments  to  public  offices  were  to  be 

made  strictly 

in  accordance  with 

the  applicable  rules  and 

regulations.  Recently,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Dr. 

Shamim  Tariq  VS  International  Islamic  University,  Islamabad  (2020 

PLC (C.S.)  499) held as follows:-

“Adherence to the statutory rules and procedures for selection 
of public jobs is the only surest method to objectively select the 
best out of the best from a competing lot; it is rooted into the 
fundamentals of equal opportunity, equal treatment and equal 
protections; any deviation therefrom would rock the bottom of 
the Republic, resting upon equiponderance. State authority in 
every sphere of life is a sacred trust to be exercised fairly and 
justly  by  the  functionaries  to  accomplish  the  purposes 
assigned to them by law; it is their bounden duty to do right to 
the all manner of people, without any distinction. It is most 
important that right people are selected for official positions to 
serve the Republic as it is imperative to survive and sustain 
into  today's  competitive  World;  deviation  would  be 
treacherously seditious. Constitutionally recognized principle 
of  equal  opportunity  is  strengthened  by  divine  affirmation, 
upheld and followed by every modern constitution of the day.”

In  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  section  10  of  the 

Federal  Public  Service  Commission  Ordinance,  1977,  the  Federal 

Government  made 

the  Federal  Public  Service  Commission  

(Functions)  Rules,  1978.  Rule  3(1)  of  the  said  Rules  provides that the 

F.P.S.C.  shall  conduct  tests  and  examinations  for  recruitment  to  all 

posts  in  connection  with  the  affairs  of  the  Federation  in  BPS-16  and 

above  or  equivalent.  In  the  said  notification  dated  15.03.2019,  there 

is  no  quota  reserved  for  appointment  by  transfer  to  any  of  the  posts 

in  BPS-16  and  above.  Appointment  to  civil  posts  in  BPS-16  and 

above 

fall  within  the  purview  of  the  Federal  Public  Service 

Commission  (“F.P.S.C.”).  Appointment  by  transfer  to  posts  in  BPS-

16  and  above 

in  the  F.D.E.  can  be  made  only 

if  either  the 

department/F.D.E.  certifies  that  there  is  no  person  eligible  for 

promotion  or 

the  departmental  promotion  committee,  after 

considering  the  persons  eligible  for  promotion,  does  not  find  them 

fit  for  promotion  (where  the  post  is  to  be  filled  by  promotion),  and  if 

the  competitive  process  for  initial  appointment  initiated  by  the 

Federal  Public  Service  Commission  does  not  result 

in 

the 

appointment  of  a  suitable candidate (where the post is to be filled by 

initial  appointment).  An  appointment  by  transfer  made  to  a  post  in 

BPS-16  and  above  without  the  departmental  promotion  committee 

considering  candidates 

for  promotion  or  without  the  F.P.S.C. 

carrying  out  a  competitive  process  for  initial  appointment,  as  the 

case  may  be,  would  be  in  violation  of  the  method  of appointment set

out  in  the  said  notification,  and  therefore  unlawful.  In  holding  so,  I 

derive guidance  from  the law laid down in the following case law:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Sharif  Tareen  VS  Government  of 

Balochistan  (2018  SCMR  54),  it  was  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  that  a  post  which  is  required  by  the  rules to be 

filled  by  initial  recruitment  cannot  be  filled  by  promotion, 

transfer,  absorption,  or  by  any  other  method  which  is  not 

provided  by  the  relevant  law  and  rules.  Furthermore,  after 

making  reference  to  the  law  laid  down  in  the  case  of  Ali  Azhar 

Khan  Baloch  VS  Province  of  Sindh  (2015  SCMR  456),  it  was 

held as follows:- 

“8.   The quintessence of the paragraphs reproduced above 
is that the appointments made on deputation, by absorption 
or by transfer under the garb of exigencies of service in an 
outrageous  disregard  of  merit  impaired  efficiency  and 
paralyzed the good governance and that perpetuation of this 
phenomenon, even for a day more would further deteriorate 
the state of efficiency and good governance.” 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Sudhir  Ahmed  VS  The  Speaker,  Balochistan 

Provincial  Assembly  (2017  SCMR  2051),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  held 

that  since  under  the  Balochistan  Provincial 

Assembly  Secretariat  (Recruitment)  Rules,  2009,  the  post  of 

Liaison  Officer  could  not  be  filled  except  by  promotion  of  an 

Assistant  Liaison  Officer  with  5  years  of  service, 

the 

appointment  to  the  said  post  by  deputation  or  by  absorption 

being against  the law could not be maintained. 

(iii)  This  Court,  vide  judgment  dated  14.02.2018  passed  in  writ 

petition  No.324  of  2017,  titled  “Haseeb  Iftikhar  Ahmad  VS  The 

Secretary,  Law  and  Justice  Division,  Government  of  Pakistan” 

allowed  the  said  petition  challenging  respondent  No.2‟s 

appointment  by  transfer  to  the  post  of  Assistant  Registrar  (BS-

16) 

in  the  Customs  Appellate  Tribunal,  Peshawar  on  the 

ground  that  the  appointment  was  contrary  to  the  method  of 

appointment  to  the  said  post  prescribed 

in  notification 

S.R.O.747(I)/98  dated  01.07.1998  issued  by  the  Ministry  of 

Law,  Justice  and  Human  Rights.  The  said  notification provided 

that  the  post  of  Assistant  Registrar  shall  be  filled  by  initial

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212,

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

appointment  and  failing  that  by  transfer.  In  the  said  judgment, 

it was held as follows:- 

“12.  There is no dispute as to the qualifications of respondent 
No.2  for  appointment  as  Assistant  Registrar,  Customs 
Appellate  Tribunal.  The  sole  question  that  needs  to  be 
determined is whether respondent No.2‟s appointment has 
been made in compliance with the method of appointment 
prescribed in the said notification dated 01.07.1998. The said 
notification provides that the post of Assistant Registrar shall 
be filled in by initial appointment and failing that by transfer. 
The import of the said requirement is that if the process for the 
initial appointment does not result in the selection of a suitable 
person with the requisite qualifications for appointment as 
Assistant Registrar,  only  then  can  the post of Assistant 
Registrar be filled by transfer. Since it is an admitted position 
that no steps, whatsoever, were taken to fill the post of 
Assistant  Registrar  by  initial  appointment,  therefore, 
appointment of Assistant Registrar could not be made by 
transfer. The employment of the words “failing that”, in the said 
notification implies that an appointment by transfer can only be 
made if the process initiated for filing the post of Assistant 
Registrar by initial appointment is not successful. Indeed, 
paragraph-4 of the said notification provides the procedure for 
the appointment by transfer, but the same does not override 
the  explicit  requirement  in  the  said  notification  that  an 
appointment by transfer can be made only if an appointment by 
initial appointment cannot be made. If the contention of the 
learned counsel for the respondents is to be accepted then the 
words “the post of Assistant Registrar shall be filled in by initial 
appointment”  in  the  said  notification would  be  rendered 
redundant. Since no effort was made by the Ministry of Law, 
Justice and Human Rights to fill the post of Assistant Registrar, 
Customs  Appellate  Tribunal,  by  initial  appointment,  the 
appointment of respondent No.2 to the said post by transfer is 
contrary to the requirements of the said notification dated 
01.07.1998, and therefore, unlawful.” 

40.  As  mentioned  above,  paragraph  5  of  the  notification  dated 

15.03.2019  (laying  down  the  method  of  appointment  to  posts  in  BPS-

16  and  above  in  the  F.D.E.)  provides  inter alia  that  appointment  by 

transfer  shall  be  made  by  selection  from  amongst  the  persons 

“holding  appointment  on  regular  basis  under  the  Federal 

Government.”  The  deputations  serving  in  the  F.D.E.  against  posts  in 

BPS-16  and  above,  are  certainly  not  holding  appointment  on  regular 

basis  under  the  Federal  Government.  The  appointment  on  deputation 

is  temporary 

in  nature.  Civil  Service  Regulation  No.77  (Revised 

Edition  2014)  provides  that  an  officer is said to be on deputation when 

he  is  detached  on  special  “temporary  duty”  for  the  performance  of 

which 

there 

is  no  permanently  or 

temporarily  sanctioned

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 &

appointment.  Therefore,  the  deputationists  appointed  to  posts  in 

BPS-16  and  above 

in 

the  F.D.E.  cannot  be  considered 

for 

appointment  by  transfer  in  the  F.D.E.  since  they  do  not  hold  an 

appointment  on  regular  basis  under  the  Federal  Government.  As  per 

the  information  provided  by  the  F.D.E.,  these  deputationists  are 

permanent  employees  of  Provincial  education  departments  or  the 

employees  of  the  education  department  of  the  Azad  Government  of 

the State  of Jammu and Kashmir  or  Gilgit-Baltistan.   

WHETHER  APPOINTMENT  BY  TRANSFER  RESERVED  FOR  10% 
POSTS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER (BPS-14) IN THE F.D.E. 
IS  TO  BE  MADE  ONLY  BY  ABSORBING  THE  DEPUTATIONISTS 
SERVING AGAINST THE SAID POST :- 

41.  Section  5  of  the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  provides  that 

appointment  to  an  All-Pakistan  Service  or  to  a  civil  service  of  the 

Federation  or  to  a  civil  post  in  connection  with  the  affairs  of  the 

Federation,  including  any  civil  post  connected  with  defence,  shall 

be  made  in  the  prescribed  manner  by  the  President  or  by  any 

person  authorized  by  the  President  in  that  behalf.  Section  2(1)(g)  of 

the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  defines  “rules”  to  mean  rules  made  or 

deemed  to  have  been  made  under  the  said  Act.  Section  25(1)  of  the 

said  Act  provides  that  the  President  or  any  person  authorized  by the 

President  in  this  behalf  may  make  such  rules  as  appear  to  him  to  be 

necessary  or expedient  for carrying  out  the purposes  of this Act.   

42. 

In  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  Section  25  of  the  said 

Act,  the  President  made  the  APT  Rules.  The  three  modes  of 

appointment  provided  in  Section  3(1)  of  the  said  Rules  are  (i)  by 

promotion, 

(ii)  by 

transfer,  and 

(iii)  by 

initial  appointment. 

Appointments  by  transfer  are  required  to  be  made  in  accordance 

with  Part-II  of  the  said  Rules  titled  “Appointments by Promotion or 

Transfer.”  Rule  7  which  finds  its  place  in  Part-II  of  the  said  Rules 

provides  that  promotions  and  transfers  to  posts  in  BPS-02  to  BPS-18 

and  equivalent  shall  be  made  on  the  recommendation  of  the 

appropriate  departmental  promotion  committee,  and  promotions 

and  transfers  to  posts  in  BPS-19  to  BPS-21  and  equivalent  shall  be 

made  on  the  recommendation  of  the  selection  boards.  Rule  8 

provides  that  only  such  persons  as  possess  the  qualifications  and 

meet  the  conditions  laid  down  for  the  purpose  of  promotion  or 

 
 
20 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

transfer  to  a  post  shall  be  considered  by  the  departmental 

promotion  committee  or  the  Central  Selection  Board,  as  the  case 

may  be.  Rule  9  of  the  said  Rules  provides  that  appointments  by 

transfer  shall  be  made 

from  amongst 

the  persons  holding 

appointment  on  a  regular  basis  in  posts  in  the  same  basic  pay  scale 

or equivalent  to or  identical with the  posts to be filled.  

43.  Although  the  APT  Rules  do  not  expressly  provide  for  the 

absorption  of  a  deputationist  to  be  one  of  the  modes  of  an 

appointment  by  transfer,  in  the  case  reported  as  2013 SCMR 1752 

(In  the  matter  of  contempt  proceedings  against  Chief  Secretary, 

Sindh  and  Others),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  after  making 

reference  to  the  three  modes  for  the  appointment  of  civil  servants 

prescribed  in  the  APT  Rules,  held inter alia that  „absorption‟  itself  is 

an appointment  by transfer.   

44. 

It  is  an  admitted  position  that  the  absorption  of  a deputationist 

is  not  the  only  mode  for  appointment  by  transfer.  As  mentioned 

above,  paragraph  6  of  the  notification  (SRO  338(I)/2011)  dated 

30.03.2011  (laying  down  the  method  of  appointment  to  posts  of  EST 

(BPS-14)  and  Sub-Librarian  (BPS-15)  in  the  F.D.E.)  provides  that 

appointment  by  transfer  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions  of  Rule  7  and  9  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules.  The  A.P.T.  Rules  do 

not  make  absorption  of  deputationists  to  be  the  only  mode  of 

appointment  by  transfer.  Therefore,  the  10%  quota  reserved  for 

appointment  by  transfer  to  the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14)  under  the 

F.D.E.  is  not  to  be  filled  only  by  the  absorption  of  deputationists. 

Against  the  said  10%  quota,  persons  holding  appointment  on  a 

regular  basis  in  posts  in  the same basic pay scale or equivalent to or 

identical  to  the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14)  and  who  possess  the 

qualifications  and  meet  the  conditions  laid  down  for  the  purpose  of 

transfer  to  the  said  post  can  also  be  considered  for  appointment  by 

transfer  by  the  departmental  selection  committee.  Therefore,  a 

deputationist  in  the  F.D.E.  who  does  not  hold  a  post  equivalent  to 

that  of  EST  (BPS-14) 

in  his/her  parent  department  cannot  be 

considered  for  appointment  by  transfer  to  the  said  post  in  the  F.D.E. 

The  deputationists  in  the  F.D.E.  (whether  or  not  appointed  under  the 

wedlock  policy)  do  not  have  an  exclusive  right  to  have  the  10% 

21 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

quota  for  appointment  by  transfer  to  the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14)  to  be 

filled  by  their  absorption.  Other  persons  eligible  in  terms  of  Rules  7 

and  9  of  the  APT  Rules  are  also  eligible  to  be  appointed  by  transfer 

to  the  post  of  EST  (BPS-14).  Therefore,  the  deputationists  serving  as 

EST 

(BPS-14)  cannot  be  considered 

for  absorption  without 

considering  other  persons  eligible  in  terms  of  Rules  7  and  9  of  the 

APT  Rules  for  appointment  by  transfer  to  the  said  posts  by 

subjecting  both  categories 

to  a  process  of  selection.  An 

appointment  by  transfer  ought  to  be  distinguished  from  an  ordinary 

transfer  in  the  exigency  of  service  for  which  a  process  of  selection 

is  not  mandatory.  It  is  well  settled  that  appointment  by  transfer  is  a 

regular  appointment  in  a  particular  department  as  a  result  of 

transfer  from  another  one,  and  that  for  such  an  appointment  one 

has  to  go  through  the  process  of  selection.  The  deputationists 

serving  the  F.D.E.  cannot  be  given  a  priority  or  preferential 

treatment  over  the  other  candidates  who  may  be  eligible  for 

appointment  by  transfer  in  terms  of  Rules  7  and  9  of  the  APT  Rules. 

Both  categories  will  have  to  compete  for  appointment  by  transfer 

and  the  best  out  of  the  best  will  have  to  be  selected  through  a  duly 

advertised  competitive  process  of  appointment  by  transfer  against 

the  10%  of  the  quota  reserved  for  appointment  by  transfer  to  the 

posts  of  EST  (BPS-14)  in  the  F.D.E.  This  is  of  course  subject  to  the 

caveat  that  a  deputationist  in  the  F.D.E.  would  be  considered  for 

appointment  by  transfer  to  the  said  post  only  if  his/her  appointment 

on deputation  was the  result  of a process  of selection.   

45.  For  the  absorption  or  confirmation  of  any  deputationist  in 

the  borrowing  department,  the  Esta  Code  prescribes  a  procedure. 

Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.1(28)/75-D.II  dated  06.03.1975 

provides  that  where  there  is  an  intention  to  permanently  absorb  a 

deputationist  in  the  cadre  or  department  where  he  is  serving  on 

deputation  and  the  recruitment  rules  for  the  post  provide  for  such 

a  course,  in  such  cases  the  consent  of  a  deputationist  to  the 

suspension  or  termination  of  lien  on  his  permanent  post  in  the 

parent  department  as  well  as  the  agreement  of  the  parent 

department  should  be  obtained.  With  the  completion  of  these 

formalities,  a  deputationist  will  be  treated  as  a  regular  member  of 

22 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

the  establishment  of  the  borrowing  department.  As  early  as  1952, 

it  was  stated  in  Ministry  of  Finance‟s  letter  No.600-RIII/52,  dated 

06.03.1952  that  permanent  officers  belonging  to  a  Government  or 

Department,  while  on  deputation  to  another  Government  or 

Department,  should  not  be  confirmed  in  the  latter  without  the 

prior  formal  concurrence  of  the  former  and  the  consent  of  the 

officer  concerned.  This  instruction  has  been  formally  recognized 

in Establishment  Division‟s O.M.  No.8.7/64-E.I  dated 19.10.1964.    

46.  Now,  the  procedure  for  the  absorption  of  a  deputationist in the 

borrowing  department  prescribed  in  the  said  O.M.  dated  06.03.1975 

cannot  override  the  method  of  appointment  prescribed  in  the 

recruitment  rules,  and  in  particular  the  procedure  for  appointment 

by  transfer  prescribed  in  the  recruitment  rules.  A  deputationist 

serving  in  the  F.D.E.  cannot  be  absorbed  if  he/she  does not meet the 

eligibility  criteria  for  appointment  by  transfer  prescribed  in  the 

recruitment  rules.   

WHETHER A PERSON CAN BE APPOINTED ON DEPUTATION TO 
ANY  POST  IN  THE  F.D.E.  WHICH  THE  RECRUITMENT  RULES 
REQUIRE  TO  BE  FILLED  BY  PROMOTION  OR 
INITIAL 
APPOINTMENT:- 

47.  The  practice  of  making  appointments  on  deputation  to  posts, 

which  under  the  recruitment  rules  of  the  organization  where  such 

appointments  are  made  are  required  to  be  filled  by  promotion  or 

initial  appointment,  warrants  condemnation  in  the  strongest  terms. 

It  is  a  judicially  recognized  fact  that  appointments  on  deputation 

have  created  unrest  and  a  sense  of  deprivation  in  the  organization 

where  such  appointments  are  made.  Such  appointments  cannot  be 

permitted  to  continue  and  deprive  the  employees  of the organization 

of  their  right  to  be  considered  for  promotion  to  the  posts  over  which 

deputationists  are  appointed.  Equally  abhorrent  is  the  practice  of 

appointing  deputationists  to  posts  which  under  the  recruitment 

rules  are  reserved  for  appointment  by  direct  recruitment.  In  the 

case  of  Zubair  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2016  PLC  C.S.  259),  the 

Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh,  after  making  reference  to  Serial  No.21-

A  of  the  Esta  Code  (Edition  2007)  Volume-I,  observed  that  the  filling 

of  a  post  on  deputation  is  necessary  only  if  no  suitable  person  is 

available  for  appointment  to  a  particular  post  and  where  it  is  in  the 

 
23 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

public  interest  to  make  an  appointment  on  temporary  basis  or  by 

deputation.  It  is  my  view  that  public  functionaries  who  facilitate  or 

cause  such  appointments  of  deputationists  without  having  carried 

out  a  process  for  promotion  or  initial  appointment  to  fill  the  post  in 

question  are  not  just  guilty  of  inefficiency  and  misconduct  by 

violating  the  applicable  recruitment  rules,  but  also  of  misuse  of 

authority  by bestowing a service  advantage  on  the deputationists.   

48.  Letter  dated  08.04.2019 

from  the  F.D.E.  to  the  Deputy 

Secretary 

(Education),  Ministry  of  Federal  Education  and 

Professional  Training  shows  that  129  deputationists  were  working 

against  the  posts  of  TUGT  (BPS-16),  which  posts  are  reserved under 

the  recruitment  rules  for  promotion.  In  the  said  letter,  it  was  also 

mentioned  that  the  129  deputationists  working  against  the  posts  of 

TUGT  (BPS-16)  had  blocked  the  promotion  of  129  Elementary 

School  Teachers  (BPS-14)  to  said  posts.  As  per  the  information 

provided  by  the  F.D.E.,  presently  the  number  of  deputationists 

working against  posts  in BPS-14  and above  are  as follows:-

49.  The  Ministry  of  Federal  Education  and  Professional  Training 

and  the  F.D.E.  are  under  an  obligation  to  initiate  a  process  for 

promotion  or  direct  recruitment,  as  the  case  may  be,  against  all  the 

posts  in  BPS-15  and  above  which,  under  the  recruitment  rules 

(contained  in  the  notifications  (SRO  338(I)/2011)  dated  30.03.2011 

and  (S.R.O.  373(I)/2019)  dated  15.03.2019),  are  required  to  be  filled 

by  promotion  or  initial  appointment.  Appointment  on  deputation 

against  posts  in  BPS-15  and  above  in  the  F.D.E.  is  of  no  legal 

consequence  since  the  said  recruitment  rules  provide  for  the 

method  of  appointment  to  the  said  posts  to  be  through  promotion 

and  direct  recruitment.  In  holding  so,  reliance  is  placed  on  the 

following case law:-

 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Rashid  Gul  VS  Controlling  Authority,  Board  of 

Intermediate  and  Secondary  Education,  Mardan  (2017  PLC 

(C.S.)  Note  32),  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  Peshawar 

High Court held as follows:- 

“12.  Even otherwise the appointment of deputationists in 
another department is always discouraged by the Superior 
Judiciary of the country, as it has been time and again held 
that  by  inducting  outsiders  in  other  department,  the 
employees of that department who are already serving after 
qualifying the departmental examinations and going through 
the selection process, have been adversely effected and their 
reasonable expectation vis-a-vis their promotion, seniority 
etc, has been snatched away while importing the outsiders. 
By posting outsiders on the basis of deputation has also 
created an unrest and sense of deprivation having been 
created amongst the employees already working there and 
practice of such appointments on deputation basis has been 
declared against justice, equity and good governance. In this 
respect discretionary powers are not unbridled or unfettered, 
but said discretion required by law to be exercised in judicial 
manner which means that same must be exercised on sound 
judicial principles.” 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Zubair  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2016  PLC 

(C.S.)  259),  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of 

Sindh  declared  the  notification  for  appointment  on  deputation 

basis  to  the  post  of  Director  General,  Department  of  Plant 

Protection  to  be  without  lawful  authority  and  of  no  legal  effect 

since 

recruitment 

rules  provided 

for 

the  method  of 

appointment  to  the  said  post to be made by promotion or initial 

appointment.  In  the  said  case,  it  was  held  inter alia that “it is 

inexplicable  that  in  the  whole  hierarchy  and  or  chain  of 

command  of  the  civil  servants  not  a  single  person  is 

competent to be appointed or promoted on regular basis as 

Director General DPP.” 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Dr.  Altaf  Hussain  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan 

(2013  PLC  (C.S.)  1178),  this  Court  allowed  a  writ  petition 

against  the  appointment  of  respondent  No.3  as  Executive 

Director,  Pakistan  Institute  of  Medical  Sciences  (“PIMS”)  on 

deputation  basis  on  the  ground  that  the  recruitment  rules 

provided  the  method  of  appointment  to  the  said  post  through 

promotion.  Furthermore,  this  Court  directed  that  the  process 

of  promotion  to  the  post  of  Executive  Director  PIMS  be 

 
 
25 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

immediately  commenced  by  considering 

the  eligible 

candidates  for promotion  on the  basis of seniority-cum-fitness. 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Safeer  Hussain  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2013 

PLC  (C.S.)  28),  this  Court  held  that  “deputation  in  the 

government department have a very significant feature, which 

requiring to be hired under some special circumstances when 

there is no any expert person is available in such department 

in the relevant subject or field.” 

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Syed  Imtiaz  Ali  Shah  VS  Government  of  Sindh 

(2012  PLC  (C.S.)  1232),  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court  of  Sindh  observed 

that  as  a  result  of  making 

appointments  on  deputation  “those who are eligible and are 

likely to be promoted in the department are deprived of their 

lawful right to promotions which is a permanent cause of heart 

burning to the cadre officers.”  

(vi) 

In  the  case  of  Safdar  Ali  Sahito  VS  Province  of  Sindh  (2011 

PLC  (C.S.)  956),  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh  observed that 

the  authorities  had  created  unrest  and  a  sense  of  deprivation 

amongst  employees  already  working 

in  a  particular 

department  when  outsiders  are 

first  posed 

in  such  a 

department  on  deputation  basis,  and  then  subsequently 

absorbed.  The  Hon'ble  High  Court  noted  that 

if  such  a 

tendency  was  encouraged, 

it  would  create 

frustration 

amongst  the  employees  of  the  same  grade  and  cadres  and 

would  obstruct  and  hinder  the  right  of  promotion  of  deserving 

employees. 

50.  Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.1/28/75-D.II/R.3/R.I  dated 

11.04.2000  makes  it  clear  that “where a post proposed to be filled 

is  reserved  under  the  rules  for  departmental  promotion, 

appointment on deputation may be made only if the department 

certifies that no eligible person is available for promotion or the 

eligible person is found unfit for promotion by the appropriate 

DPC / Selection Board.”  Furthermore,  it  is  provided  that  “in such 

cases,  deputation may  be  approved  till  such  time  a  suitable 

person  becomes  available  for  promotion.”  The  said  O.M.  also 

provides  that  “in case of posts reserved for initial recruitment, 

26 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

appointment  on  deputation  may  be  made  only  as  temporary 

arrangement, pending joining of the nominee of the FPSC, and 

subject to the condition that such appointment shall be made only 

after a requisition has been placed with the FPSC.” Additionally, 

Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.1/28/75-R.I  dated  14.03.1995 

(Serial  No.29  of  the  Esta  Code)  provides  inter  alia  that  “no 

deputation  proposals  will  be  entertained  which  will adversely 

affect the method of appointment to the post as laid down in the 

recruitment  rules.”  Appointments  on  deputation  in  the  F.D.E. 

without  the  fulfillment  of  the  conditions  laid  down  in  the  said  O.M. 

would  be  unlawful  and  the 

incumbents  would  be 

liable  to 

immediate  repatriation  to  their  respective  parent  departments  so 

as  to  pave  the  way  for  appointment  by  promotion  or  initial 

appointment,  as  the  case  may  be,  strictly  in  accordance  with  the 

recruitment  rules.  The  mere  fact  that  the  post  required  by  the 

recruitment  rules  to  be  filled  by  promotion or initial appointment is 

occupied  by  a  deputationist  shall  not  pose  as  an  obstacle  in  the 

initiation  of  the  process  for  filling  up  the  post  in  accordance  with 

the method  of appointment  envisaged  by the recruitment  rules.  

WHETHER A DEPUTATIONIST IS LIABLE TO BE REPATRIATED TO 
HIS/HER PARENT DEPARTMENT UPON COMPLETION OF MAXIMUM 
DEPUTATION PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS:- 

51.  The  period  for  which  a  government  servant  could  be  sent  on 

deputation  was  initially  regulated  by  Establishment  Division‟s  O.M. 

No.1(28)/75-D.II/R.I  dated  18.02.1987  (Serial  No.27  of  the  Esta  Code). 

The  said  O.M.  provided inter alia  that  the  normal  period  of  deputation 

for  all  categories  of  government  servants  would  be  three  years,  and 

that  this  period  would  be  extendable  by  two  years  with  the  prior 

approval  of  the  competent  authority.  The  said  O.M.  further  provided 

that  on  completion  of  the  maximum  period  of  five  years,  both  the 

borrowing  and  the  lending  organizations  should  ensure  immediate 

repatriation  of  the  deputationist.  In  case 

it 

is  not  possible  to 

repatriate  a  person  to  his  parent  organization  for  compelling  reasons, 

the  case  should  be  referred  to  the  Establishment  Division  before  the 

expiry  of  the  maximum  period  of  five  years,  fully  explaining  the 

circumstances  due  to  which  immediate  repatriation  is  not  possible 

 
 
27 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

and  measures  taken  to  obtain  or  groom  a  replacement  as  early  as 

possible. 

52. 

Instructions  on 

the  subject  of  deputations 

issued  vide 

Establishment  Division's  O.M.  dated  18.2.1987,  were  modified  vide 

Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.1/28/75-D.2/R.I  dated  14.03.1995 

(Serial  No.29  of  the  Esta  Code)  by  providing  inter alia  that  in  future, 

the  deputation  period  will  be  limited  to  three  years  only;  that  a 

maximum  two  years  extension  in  the  deputation  period  will  be 

considered  only  in  exceptional  cases,  in  the  public  interest,  and  with 

the  prior  approval  of  the  Establishment  Division  in  all  cases  of 

Government  servants  in  BPS-17  and  above;  and  that  the  extension 

cases  shall  be  forwarded  to  the  Establishment  Division  at  least  six 

months  before  the  expiry  of  the  three-year  deputation  period  and with 

proper  justification  for  the  proposal.  The  said  modification  was 

necessitated  due  to  the  growing  tendency  to  resort  to  postings 

through  deputation  despite  the  fact  that  deputation  is  not  a  normal 

prescribed  method  of  appointment  under  the  A.P.T.  Rules.  It  was  also 

noted  in  the  said  O.M.  that  filling  up  the  posts  through  deputation,  if 

not  provided  so  in  the  recruitment  rules,  leads  to  the  following 

adverse  implications:- 

"(i)   In  case  of  promotion  posts,  the  promotions  of 
departmental personnel are delayed/stopped. 
(ii)  In case the post is required to be filled through initial 
appointment, quota of a particular province is affected." 

53. 

In  an  earlier  O.M.  No.1(28)/75-D.II  dated  06.03.1975,  the 

Establishment  Division  had  expressed  its  concern  with  regard  to 

officers  whose  services  were  obtained  on  deputation  for  a  specific 

period  were  not  returned  by  the  borrowing  department  when  the 

parent  department  asked  for  their  reversion.  Establishment  Division‟s 

O.M.  No.1(28)/71-D.II  dated  28.03.1972  provided  inter  alia  that 

officers  obtained  on  deputation  should  be  reverted  to  their  parent 

department  on the expiry of the period of deputation.   

54.  The  Esta  Code 

is  a  compendium  of 

laws,  rules  and 

administrative  instructions  pertaining  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of 

service  of  civil  servants,  and  is  said  to  have  served  as  a  standard 

reference  work  in  officialdom.  The  Esta  Code  contains  instructions 

and  policy  decisions  in  the  form  of  office  memoranda  issued  by  the 

 
28 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

Establishment  Division  regarding  appointment  by  deputation.  The 

said  Office  Memoranda  dated  28.03.1972,  06.03.1975  and 

18.02.1987  are  contained  in  the  Esta  Code.  In  the  interest  of  official 

administration,  the  said instructions  should be followed rigidly. 

55.  The  administrative 

instructions  and  the  policy  guidelines 

contained  in  the  Esta  Code  would  not  be  worth  the  paper  they  are 
written  on  if  they  are  allowed  to  be  flouted  with  impunity  by  the 

government  departments  or  public  functionaries  manning  such 

departments.  It  is  my  view  that  breach  of  such  administrative 

instructions  and  policy  guidelines  by  public  functionaries  amounts 

not  only  to  inefficiency  but  also  misconduct, and ought to expose the 

delinquent  officials  to  disciplinary  action.  In  the  case  of  Ghansham 

Das  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2017  PLC  (C.S.)  191),  while  making 

reference  to  the  law  laid  down  in  the  cases  of    Muhammad  Yousaf 

VS  Abdul  Rashid  (1996  SCMR  1297),  Azra  Riffat  Rana  VS Secretary, 

Ministry  of  Housing  &  Works  (PLD  2008  SC  476)  and  Fazali  Rehmani 

VS  Chief  Minister,  N.-W.F.P.  (PLD  2008  SC  769),  I  had  the  occasion 

to hold as follows:- 

“12.  Office Memoranda issued by the Establishment Division from 
time to time, consistent with the statute and statutory rules on the 
subject, is a matter of policy, which all government departments 
and public functionaries are expected to strictly adhere to. The 
Establishment Division is at liberty to improve or amend the policy 
set-out  in  such Office Memoranda  in  order  to bring them in 
complete  harmony  with  the  applicable  statute  or  statutory 
instrument.  As  long  as  the  policy  contained  in  such  Office 
Memoranda is there, the Government or its instrumentality is 
expected not to deviate therefrom. These Office Memoranda have 
acquired the force of rules on the strength of the language of 
Section 25(2) of the Civil Servants Act, 1973. Any deviation from 
such a policy by the state or its instrumentality can be corrected by 
the Service Tribunal at the instance of an aggrieved party/civil 
servant, and, if the bar contained in Article 212 of the Constitution 
is not attracted, such deviation can be subjected to judicial review 
in the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Courts.” 

56. 

In  the  case  of  Fazl-i-Qadir  VS  Secretary,  Establishment 

Division  (PLD  1988  S.C.  131),  the  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice  Shafi  ur 

Rehman  (as  he  then  was)  speaking  for  the  Full  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  with  reference  to  the  administrative  instructions 

contained  in  Serial  No.11  of  the  Esta  Code  (1983)  regarding  the 

formation  of Occupational  Groups,  held as follows:- 

“The contents of the Office Memorandum are general in character 
and contain all the necessary details for giving them the form and 

 
29 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

efficacy of a Service Rule. They appear in a printed volume of the 
Establishment Code governing the terms and conditions and the 
discipline  in  service.  Merely  because  they  did  not  bear  the 
appellation of Rules is not sufficient to reduce their legal status. 
There is abundant authority of decisions of this Court to treat such 
instructions as rules and fully capable of setting aside or modifying 
the rules.” 

57. 

In  suo  moto  case  No.24/2011  (PLD  2011  S.C.  277),  an  eight-

member  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  set-aside  the  re-

employment  of  a  retired  police  officer  on  contract  basis  due  to  non-

adherence  with  the  requirements  of  Section  14  of  the  Civil  Servants 

Act,  1973  as  well  as  the  instructions  contained  in  the  Esta  Code, 

Volume-I 

(Edition  2007)  under 

the  heading  “Re-employment.” 

Additionally,  in  the  case  of  Pir  Muhammad  Qureshi  VS  Chairman, 

P.O.F.  Board,  Wah  Cantt.  (1998  PLC  (C.S.)  476),  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  observed 

that 

the  Departmental  Promotion 

Authorities  must  strictly  adhere  to  the  instructions  contained  in  the 

Esta  Code while determining  the criteria  for  promotions. 

58.  Rule  20A  was  inserted  in  the  APT  Rules  through  Establishment 

Division‟s  notification  SRO  365(I)/2007  dated  03.05.2007.  The 

maximum  period  for  which  a  deputationist  can  be  appointed  is 

regulated  by  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules.  Rule  20A(1)  of  the  A.P.T. 

Rules,  titled “Appointment on deputation” provides  that “a person in 

the service of a Provincial Government or an autonomous, semi 

autonomous body or corporation or any other organization set-up, 

established,  owned,  managed,  or  controlled  by  the  Federal 

Government  who  possesses  the  minimum  educational 

qualifications,  experience  or  comparable  length  of  service 

prescribed for a post shall be eligible for appointment to the said 

post on deputation for a period not exceeding three years which 

may be extended for another period of two years on such terms and 

conditions  as  may  be  sanctioned  by  Federal  Government  in 

consultation with the lending Organization.” 

59.  There  was  no  scope  under  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  for  the 

deputation  period  of  a  deputationist  to  be  extended  beyond  five 

years.  Unlike 

the  Establishment  Division‟s  said  O.M.  dated 

18.02.1987,  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  does  not  provide  for  an 

extension  of  the  deputation  period  beyond  five years for “compelling 

 
30 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

reasons.”  Therefore,  upon  completion  of  the  maximum  permissible 

deputation  period  of  five  years,  it  is  obligatory  upon  the  borrowing 

department 

to 

repatriate  a  deputationist 

to  his/her  parent 

department.  Failure  on  the  part  of  the  borrowing  department  to 

repatriate  a  deputationist  who  completes  the  maximum  permissible 

deputation  period  of  five  years  would  be  an  actionable  wrong. 

Payment  of  salary 

to  a  deputationist  beyond 

the  maximum 

deputation  period  of  five  years  is  an  unnecessary  and  unjustified 

burden  on  the  exchequer  and  ought  to  be  made  good  from  the 

personal  coffers  of  the  public  functionaries 

in  the  borrowing 

department  who  are  derelict 

in  their  duty 

in  not  relieving  a 

deputationist  upon  completion  of  the  said  period.    In  cases  where  a 

deputationist 

is  not  relieved  by  the  borrowing  department,  a 

deputationist  should  nevertheless  resume  his/her  duties  in  her 

parent  department  on  completion  of  the  five  years,  failing  which  a 

deputationist  would  be 

liable 

to  be  proceeded  against 

for 

misconduct  by  the  parent  department.  At  this  stage,  it  is  apposite to 

refer  to  Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.1/28/75-D.II(CV)  dated 

04.11.1980  (Serial  No.28  of  the  Esta  Code),  paragraphs  (ii)  and  (iii) 

whereof  are  reproduced  herein  below:- 

“(ii)  If a person is on deputation to a Government organization, 
and has completed the maximum tenure of five years, he must 
revert  or  be  reverted  by  the  borrowing  office  to  his 
parent/lending  Organization  of  the  expiry  of  that  period, 
otherwise, the Audit Offices concerned shall not make payment 
of salary and allowances to him beyond the date of expiry of five 
years,  unless  specifically  authorized  by  the  Establishment 
Division. 
(iii)  If a person is on deputation to an autonomous organization/ 
corporation etc., and has completed the maximum tenure of five 
years, it will be obligatory for that person to report back to his 
parent/lending  Organization  on  the  expiry  of  that  period 
irrespective of his being relieved by the borrowing Corporation/ 
Body etc. Failure to report back unless specifically authorized 
otherwise by the Establishment Division will be construed as 
"Misconduct" and make him liable to disciplinary action under the 
Government Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 1973.” 

60.  The  only  exception  to  the  said  rule  is  that  where  the posting of 

a deputationist  is on  the basis of the  wedlock policy.   

THE WEDLOCK POLICY :-

faced  by 

husbands  and  wives  in  government  service  due  to  posting  at

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

different  stations  of  duty  was  taken  into  account  by  the  Government 

more  than  two  decades  ago  and  it  was  decided  to  prescribe 

guidelines  to  facilitate  posting  of  husbands  and  wives  at  the  same 

station.  These  guidelines  were  contained 

in  the  Establishment 

Division‟s  O.M.  No.10/30/97-R.II  dated  13.05.1998  which  provided 

inter alia  that  if  a  request  involves  temporary  deputation  to  another 

department,  it  may  be  processed  in  consultation  with  the  concerned 

department,  and  may  be  accepted  on  the  prescribed  term  of 

deputation  subject  to  the  availability  of  a  post  in  the  same basic pay 

scale.  It  was  also  provided  that  spouses  posted  at  the  same  station, 

including  those  posted  on  deputation  beyond  the  prescribed 

maximum  period,  may  normally  not  be  disturbed  without  compelling 

reasons  of  public 

interest,  and  that  requests  for  extension  of 

deputation  period  beyond  the  permissible  limit  may  be  considered 

with  compassion 

if 

interests  of  public  service  would  permit. 

Furthermore,  it  was  provided  that  when  a  request  is  made  for 

permanent  transfer  to  or  absorption  in  another  department  or 

agency,  the  request  may  be  processed  in  consultation  with  the 

department  concerned.  The  policy  guidelines  set  out  in  the  said 

office memorandum  came to be known as the  wedlock policy.  

62.  By  virtue  of  the  Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.10/30/97-R-2 

dated  17.12.1999,  the  guidelines  for  postings  under  the  wedlock 

policy  were  also  made  applicable  to  unmarried  female  government 

servants.  Furthermore,  it  was  also  decided  that  the  said  guidelines 

would  be  followed  by  autonomous  /  semi-autonomous  bodies  / 

corporations,  etc. under  the control  of the  Federal  Government. 

63.  With  the  view  to  facilitate  those  female  government  servants 

whose  spouses  are  not  in  government  service  or  employed  in  the 

private  sector  or  unemployed,  it  was  decided  to  extend  the  facility 

under  the  wedlock  policy  to  this  class  of  government  servants  also 

so  that  they  are  able  to  serve  at  the  place  of  residence  of  their 

spouses.  This  decision  is  contained  in  the  Establishment  Division‟s 

O.M.  No.10/30/97-R-2  dated 21.04.2006.   

64.  Under  Rule  20A  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  the  maximum  period  for 

which  a  deputationist  could  be  posted  was  five  years.  Vide 

notification  dated  16.04.2012  a  proviso  was  inserted  to  Rule  20A,

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

which  exempted  (i)  husband  and wife serving at the same station, (ii) 

unmarried  female  government  servants  serving  at  the  place  of 

residence  of 

their  parents/family,  and 

(iii)  married 

female 

government  servants  serving  at  the  place  of  residence/posting  of 

their  husbands  who  are  not  in  government  employment  from  the 

applicability  of  maximum  deputation  period  of  five  years  prescribed 

in  Rule  20A(1)  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules.  The  said  three  categories  of 

deputationists  shall  herein  after  be  referred  to  as  the  “exempted 

categories.”  

65.  Now,  the  vital  question  that  needs  to  be  answered  is  whether 

the  exempted  categories  of  deputationists  can  claim  a  vested  right 

to  remain  on  deputation  until  their  retirement  or  until  their 

spouses/family  members  continue 

to  reside 

in 

Islamabad  or 

indefinitely  regardless  for  the  fact  that  the  borrowing  department no 

longer  wants  to  retain  their  services  or  the  parent  department  is 

seeking  their  repatriation.  This  question  already  stands  answered 

by 

this  Court 

in 

the  case  of  Muhammad  Masroor-ul-

Haq VS Federation  of  Pakistan  through  Secretary,  M/o  Overseas 

Pakistan  and  HRD,  Islamabad  (2017  PLC  (CS)  1365)  in  the  following 

terms:- 

“17.  It is indeed not pleasant for a husband and wife with school 
going children to be working in different provinces. But the law 
cannot be circumvented to bring them to the same station. The 
question that crops up in the mind is that whether a person posted 
on deputation at a particular station can claim to remain so posted 
for all the period during which his or her spouse remains posted at 
such a station, regardless of decision of the borrowing department 
to repatriate the deputationist to the parent department. I would 
think not. To hold in favour of such a deputationist would be 
tantamount to disregarding the innumerable authorities from the 
Superior Courts that no legal or vested rights were available to a 
deputationist to serve his entire period of deputation in borrowing 
department. Interestingly, the petitioner was not sent on deputation 
for  any  specific  period.  In  the  case  of  Mst. Robia Ayub VS 
Federation of Pakistan, (2013 PLC (CS) 915), the petitioner had 
challenged the repatriation to the parent department on the ground 
that it was contrary to inter-alia the wedlock policy. The petitioner 
in that case had also prayed for a direction to the borrowing 
department to absorb her. This Court dismissed the writ petition by 
inter-alia holding that the petitioner's claim on the basis of the 
wedlock policy was not justifiable. Furthermore, it was held as 
follows:- 

"10.  The  law  on  the  subject  is  very much  clear.  The 
petitioner is a civil servant and remained on deputation for a 
fixed term and was returned to her parent department in 
consequence of terms and conditions of her deputation. A

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

deputationist cannot remain on deputation for an indefinite 
period or stipulated period in accordance with his/her own 
whims and wishes. While taking this view, I am fortified by a 
judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
Dr.  Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  v.  CDA  Islamabad  through 
Chairman and others (2010 SCMR 378)." 

18.  Additionally, in the case of Asma Shaheen VS Federation of 
Pakistan (2013 PLC (C.S.) 391, this Court spurned the plea that a 
deputation cannot be repatriated due to the wedlock policy. At 
paragraph 13 of the said judgment, it has been held as follows:- 

“13.       From the plain reading of above said wedlock policy, 
it is obvious that the word "may" has been used in the said 
letters and not "shall". It has never been stressed that all the 
deputationists whose spouses are working at Islamabad shall 
must be absorbed or will continue to serve at Islamabad. As 
regards the contention that some of deputationists have been 
absorbed, the same cannot be taken into consideration, for 
the simple reason that it was the discretion of the competent 
authority to absorb some of deputationists according to 
requirement  of  department,  capabilities,  know  how, 
performance, qualification, general reputation and on the 
basis of annual confidential reports. The others cannot claim 
the same treatment as of right. The deputation is a contract 
and if borrowing department does not need the services of a 
deputationist, he or she must go back to parent department 
and thus no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been 
infringed  and  no  provisions  of  Constitution  have  been 
violated. Learned counsel for the petitioners have failed to 
rebut the contention of learned Deputy Attorney-General that 
at present no deputationist is being absorbed. There appears 
no  political  element  with  regard  to  repatriation  of  the 
petitioners to their parent departments.”” 

66.  Vide  letter  dated  01.04.2019,  the  Elementary  and  Secondary 

Education  Department,  Government  of  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  vented 

its  anguish  at  the  omission  on  the  part  of  the  F.D.E.  to  repatriate  the 

deputationists  who  had  been  on  deputation  for  more  than  five  years 

in the following terms:- 

“I am directed to refer to the subject noted and to state that 
services of the employees of Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
are placed at the disposal of Federal Government on deputation 
basis. The deputation period in respect of most of the teachers 
whom deputation period beyond 05 years have already been 
expired and they are enjoying unauthorized / illegal deputation 
which tantamount to willful absence. This department intimated the 
Federal Government time and again to relieve the teachers who are 
on  unauthorized  deputation  to  report  back  to  their  parent 
department, but they failed to comply with the direction of the 
parent department which is misconduct on their part. It is also 
pertinent to bring it into your kind notice that this province has 
already a shortage of teachers which badly affects the school‟s 
children.  
Therefore, it is requested in your honor that all those teachers who 
have completed their 5-years deputation period and are enjoying an 
unauthorized deputation period beyond 5-years may be relieved

 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

from their duties and they should report back to parent department 
immediately.” 

67.  After  the  said  communication 

from  the  Elementary  and 

Secondary  Education  Department,  Government 

of  Khyber 

Pakhtunkhwa,  the  earlier  N.O.C.s  issued  by  the  said  Department  for 

the  absorption  of  the  deputationists  no  longer  hold  good.  In  the  face 

of  the  said  request,  the  conduct  of  the  public  functionaries  in  the 

F.D.E.  as  well  as  in  its  controlling  Ministry  in  not  repatriating  such 

deputationists  en  masse  bespeaks  of  a  sorry  state  of  affairs  and 

renders  them  liable  to  disciplinary  action.  The  salaries  paid  to  such 

deputationists  after  01.04.2019  has  been  a  wasteful  burden  on  the 

national  exchequer.   

68.  A  sine  qua  non  for  an  officer  to  continue  serving  as  a 

deputationist  is  the  consent  of  the  parent  department.  The  wedlock 

policy  and/or  the  proviso  to  Rule  20A  of  the  APT  Rules  cannot  operate 

to  stop  or  stall  the  reversion  of  a  deputationist  to  his  parent 

department  where  such  department  declines  to  extend  the  deputation 

period  or  asks  for  the  reversion  of  the  deputationist  to  his/her  own 

cadre.  Establishment  Division‟s  O.M.  No.10/30/97-R-II 

dated 

28.01.2020  provides 

that  where 

the  parent  department  of  the 

deputationist  does  not  agree  to  issue  an  N.O.C.  for  a  further  extension 

of  deputation  under  the  wedlock  policy,  the  incumbent  shall  be 

repatriated  to  the  parent  department.  Similarly,  a  deputationist, 

whether  or  not  sent  on  deputation  under  the  wedlock  policy,  cannot  be 

thrust  upon  a  borrowing  department  which  is  unwilling  to  retain  the 

services  of  such  a  deputationist.  This  is  moreso  where  the  recruitment 

rules  require  the  post  occupied  by  a  deputationist  to  be  filled  through 

promotion  or 

initial  appointment.  The  method  of  appointment 

prescribed  in  the  recruitment  rules  cannot  be  ignored,  and  merit 

cannot  be  given  a  go-bye  in  order  to  keep  spouses  at  the same station. 

An  order  for  the  repatriation  of  a  deputationist  would  imply  that  the 

process  initiated  for  the  permanent  absorption  of  the  deputationist  had 

been  brought  to  an  end.  In  the  case  of  Dr.  Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  VS 

CDA,  Islamabad  (2010  SCMR  378),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  that  a  deputationist  cannot  be treated as an 

“aggrieved  person”  because  he  has  no  vested  right  to remain on a post

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212,

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

as  deputationist  forever  or  for  a  stipulated  period  as  mentioned  in 

notification  and  can  be  repatriated  at  any  time.  The  mere  initiation  of 

the  process 

for  a  deputationist‟s  absorption 

in  the  borrowing 

department  or  the  issuance  for  an  N.O.C.  by  the  parent  department 

does  not  arm  the  deputationist  with  a  vested  right  to  be  absorbed.  In 

the  case  of  Mst.  Robia  Ayub  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2013  PLC 

(C.S.)  915),  this Court  held as follows:- 

“I have no hesitation to hold that “deputation” is an administrative 
arrangement  between  borrowing  and  lending  Authorities  for 
utilizing the services of an employee in the public interest and 
exigency of services against a particular post against which the 
deputationists cannot claim any right of permanent absorption.” 

69.  Furthermore, 

in  the  case  of  Syed 

Imran  Qadir  Gilani  VS 

Federation  of  Pakistan  (2020  PLC  (C.S.)  815),  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High 

Court  held inter alia as follows:- 

“The petitioner does not have any vested right to remain on the post 
as deputationist for an indefinite period or to get absorption in the 
other department. The parent department at any time without 
assigning any reason can pass orders in respect of repatriation of 
its employee. Reliance is placed on the case reported as S. Masood 
Abbas Rizvi v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2014 SCMR 799).” 

70. 

It  is  settled  law  that  a  deputationist  may  not  necessarily 

complete  the  tenure  for  which  he/she  was  sent  on  deputation,  and 

power 

is  vested  with  the  competent  authority  to  repatriate  a 

deputationist  without  assigning  any  reason.  In  case  of  transfer  on 

deputation,  no  vested  right  accrues  to  a  deputationist  to  continue 

for 

the  period  of  deputation.  The  competent  authority  was 

empowered 

to  repatriate  a  deputationist  as  and  when 

the 

exigencies  of service  required. 

71. 

In  the  event  the  borrowing  department  does  not  want  to 

repatriate  a  deputationist  appointed  under  the  wedlock  policy or the 

parent  department  is  inclined  to  extend  the  deputation  period  of 

such  deputationist  beyond  five  years,  such  deputationist  can 

continue  serving  for  a  reasonable  period  beyond  the  maximum 

permissible  period  of  five  years  by  virtue  of  the proviso  to  Rule  20A 

of  the  A.P.T.  Rules.  However,  neither  the  parent  department  nor  the 

borrowing  department  are  under  an  obligation  to  keep  the 

exempted  categories  on  deputation  for  the  complete  five  years  or 

beyond.  The  exempted  categories  cannot  be  insulted  from  the

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

application  of  the  law  laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the 

following cases:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  S.  Masood  Abbas  Rizvi  VS  Federation  of 

Pakistan  (2014  SCMR  799), it was held as follows:- 

“It is settled principle that a deputationist does not have any 
vested right to remain on the post as deputationist forever or 
for  the  stipulated  period,  he  could  be  ordered  to  be 
repatriated to the parent Department at any time without 
assigning any reason. This issue was raised in the case of Dr. 
Shafi-ur-Rehman  Afridi  v.  C.D.A.,  Islamabad  through 
Chairman and others (2010 SCMR 378) wherein this Court 
has held that a deputationist does not have vested right to 
continue for a stipulated period. We are of the considered 
view that petitioner being deputationist has no vested right to 
remain on a post as deputationist or otherwise and can be 
ordered  to  be  repatriated and or relieved at any time. 
Moreover, in terms of section 2(b)(i) of Civil Servants Act, 
1973 such person even loses his status as “Civil Servant” 
during the period he is on deputation. The parent Department 
of the petitioner is not obliged in law, to assign reasons for 
his repatriation.” 

(ii)  As  far  back  as  1959,  the  Hon'ble  Mr.  Justice  A.R. Cornelius (as 

he  then  was)  speaking  for  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the 

case  of  Pakistan  VS  Fazal  Rahman  Khundkar  (PLD  1959  SC 

82),  held  that  a  deputationist  had  no  vested  right  to  remain  on 

deputation  contrary  to  the  wishes  of  the  lending department or 

the  borrowing  department.  The  relevant  portion  of  the  said 

report  is reproduced  herein  below:- 

“It is sufficiently clear from this that where an officer of a 
Provincial cadre is occupying on deputation, a post in the 
central Government, he does not acquire any right in 
himself to hold that post. The right which he can claim to be 
vested in himself, as a member of his Service, is to be given 
a post appropriate to his grade in the Province to which he 
belongs. His occupation of the post at the Centre is at the 
option of the Central Government, and subject to the 
consent of the Provincial Government. Such posts are fairly 
often designated as "tenure posts", a maximum period of 
incumbency  being  prescribed  in  the  public  interest, 
perhaps in order that the services of such officers should 
not be lost to their parent Provinces indefinitely, or perhaps 
in order that no officer should make, as it were, a monopoly 
of a particular post in the Central Government. However 
that may be, what appears to us to be undeniable is that 
when a post is a deputation post, the occupant of that post 
being a person holding a substantive rank in his Service, 
relatable to a different territory and Government, he does 
not gain by such occupation any vested right to retain that 
post contrary to the wishes of the Government under which 
he is serving in that post, or to the wishes of his own parent 
Government.”

2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 &

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Abdul  Majeed  VS  Chief 

  Secretary,  Punjab 

(2015 PLC  (C.S.) 1381),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore 

High  Court  that  a  deputationist  did  not  have  any  vested  right  to 

remain  on  the  post  as  deputationist  forever  or  for  a  stipulated 

period.  A  deputationist  could  be  ordered  to  be  repatriated  to  his 

parent  department  at  any  time  without  assigning  any  reason.  The 

parent  department  of  appellant-employee  was  not  bound  to 

assign reason  for  his repatriation. 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Lal  Khan  VS Employees Old Age  Benefit Institution 

(2010 PLC  (C.S.) 1377),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court  of  Sindh  that  a  deputationist  had  no  vested  right  to  remain 

on  post  forever  or  for  a  stipulated  period.  A  deputationist  could 

not  challenge  the  order  of  his  repatriation  as  he  could  be 

repatriated  to parent  department  at any time. 

72.  The 

petitioners 

have 

brought 

on 

record 

office 

orders/notifications  dated  03.09.2005,  24.05.2007,  17.05.2011, 

05.09.2012,  10.09.2012,  10.01.2013,  09.12.2014,  13.02.2015  and 

22.09.2020  issued  by  the  F.D.E.  or  its  controlling  Ministry  whereby  a 

number  of  deputationists  were  absorbed  in  the  F.D.E.  These  office 

orders  were  referred  to  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  to 

demonstrate  that  a  policy  of  pick  and  choose  had  been  adopted  by 

the  decision  makers  in  the  F.D.E.  in  absorbing  deputationists.  Since 

the 

legality  of  these  absorptions  are  not 

in 

issue 

in  these 

proceedings  the  less said about  them  the better.   

WHETHER  THE  PETITIONERS‟  LIEN  WITH  THEIR  RESPECTIVE 
PARENT DEPARTMENTS HAD TERMINATED UPON THE ISSUANCE 
OF N.O.C. FOR THEIR ABSORPTION IN THE F.D.E.:- 

73.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners'  fall  back  position  was  that 

the  petitioners  were  not  in  a  position  to  rejoin  their  duties  in  their 

respective  parent  departments,  since  upon  the  grant  of  N.O.C.s  for 

permanent  absorption  in  the  F.D.E.  their  lien  with  their  parent 

departments  stood  terminated.  This  contention  does  not  espouse 

the  cause  of  the  petitioners  since  at  no material stage was any order 

issued for  their permanent  absorption  in the  F.D.E. 

74.  Rule  21(1)  of  the  A.P.T.  Rules  provides  that  persons  appointed 

by  initial  appointment,  promotion  or  transfer  shall  be  on  probation

 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

for  a  period  of  one  year  whereas  Rule  3  of  the  Civil  Servants 

(Confirmation)  Rules,  1993  (“the  1993  Rules”)  provides  inter alia 

that  a  civil  servant  initially  appointed  to  a  post,  on  probation, 

including  a  civil  servant  promoted  or  appointed  to  a  post on transfer 

shall,  on  satisfactory  completion  of  his  probation,  be  eligible  for 

confirmation  in  that  post.  Rule  5(1)(a)  of  the  1993  Rules  provides 

that  on  confirmation  in  a  permanent  post,  a  civil  servant  shall 

acquire  a  lien  in  that  post  and  shall  retain  it  during  the  period  when 

he  holds  a  temporary  post  other  than  the  post  in  the  service  or 

cadre  against  which  he  was  originally  appointed.  Rule  5(2)  of  the 

said  Rules  provides  that  a  civil  servant  acquiring  a  lien  under  Rule 

5(1)  shall  cease  to  hold  a  lien  acquired  previously  on  any other post. 

Fundamental  Rule  14-A(a)  provides  inter alia  that  “a government 

servant‟s lien on a post may in no circumstances be terminated, 

even with his consent, if the result will be to leave him without a lien 

or a suspended lien upon a permanent post.” 

75.  As  a  government  servant  on  deputation  retains  a  lien  on  the 

permanent  post  in  his  parent  office,  he/she  is  ordinarily  governed by 

the  rules  of  the  lending  government  in  matters  of  pay,  leave, 

pension,  etc.,  and  continues  to  be  under  the  rule-making  control  of 

the  lending  government  which  has  a  right  to  recall  him.  The  lien of a 

government  servant  holding  substantively  a  permanent  post  is 

terminated  on  his  appointment  substantively  to  a  permanent  post 

outside  the  cadre  on  which  he  is  borne.  Therefore,  a  government 

servant  on  deputation  from  a  Provincial  Government  retains  a  lien 

on  the  permanent  post  in  his  parent  office  till  his  confirmation  in  the 

borrowing  department.   

76.  By  operation  of  law,  a  deputationist‟s  lien  with  his/her  parent 

department  terminates  only  upon  confirmation  in  the  borrowing 

department 

i.e.  upon 

the  satisfactory  completion  of  his/her 

probation  period  after  appointment  by 

transfer/  permanent 

absorption  in the borrowing  department.   

77.  Since  none  of 

the  petitioners  have  been  permanently 

absorbed  or  appointed  by  transfer  in  the  F.D.E.,  their  lien  against 

their  respective  posts  in  the  parent  departments  is  intact.  As  along 

as  the  petitioners‟  status  in  the  F.D.E.  continued  to  be  that  of  a 

39 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

deputationists,  the  question  of  the  termination  of  their  lien  with  their 

respective  parent  departments  did  not  arise.  Refusal  by  the 

petitioners‟  parent  departments  to  take  them  back  on  duties  against 

the  substantive  posts  held  by  them  would  be  a  violation  of  the  law 

laid down by the Superior  Courts  in the following judgments:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Chief  Secretary,  Government  of  N.-W.F.P.  VS 

Zafarmand  Ali  (2005  SCMR  1212),  it  was  held  that  there  was 

no  justification  for  the  respondent‟s  parent  department  to 

have  terminated  his  lien  since  the  competent  authority  in  the 

borrowing  department  had  neither  passed  an  order  for  the 

respondent‟s  permanent  induction  or  appointment  by  transfer 

nor  were  any  terms  and  conditions  of  the  respondent‟s 

absorption  settled  between  the  borrowing  and  the  lending 

department.   

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Israrullah  VS  Assistant  Director, 

Manpower  (2005  SCMR  716),  it  was  held  inter alia  that  a 

deputationist  retains  his/her  lien  in  the  parent  department until 

he/she  is confirmed  in the  borrowing  department.   

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Executive  Engineer,  Provincial  Building  Circle, 

Lahore  VS  Muzaffar  Bil  Haq  (2000  SCMR  656),  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  did  not  interfere  with  the  findings  recorded  by 

the  learned  Punjab  Service  Tribunal  that  since  the  respondent 

had  never  been  permanently  absorbed 

in  the  borrowing 

department,  he  continued  to  be  on  deputation  and  therefore 

his lien could  not be terminated  in his parent  department. 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Secretary  Education  VS  Viqar-ul-Haq  (2000 

SCMR  1780),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  after  referring  to 

Fundamental  Rule  No.14-A(a),  held  inter alia  that  the  lien  of  a 

permanent  civil  servant  cannot  be  terminated  even  with  his 

consent,  and  that  the  same  could  be  terminated  only  when  he 

was confirmed  against  some  other  permanent  post. 

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Mazhar  Ali  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (1992 

SCMR  435), 

the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  after  making 

reference  Fundamental  Rules,  13,  14  and  14-A,  held  as 

follows:- 

40 

W.P.Nos.194, 932, 1146, 1158, 1212, 
 1425, 1471, 1486,1520, 1800 1851,  
2216, 2242, 2447, 2634 & 
 2677 of 2020 

“According to these, the lien of the permanent civil servants 
cannot be terminated, even with their consent. It can be 
terminated only when the civil servant is confirmed against 
some other permanent post. There is nothing on the record to 
suggest  nor  any  indication  or  plea  that  the  Federal 
Government  had  confirmed  him  on any post under the 
Federal Government. In the absence of such a material or 
evidence,  his  lien  will  be  retained  with  the  Punjab 
Government and notwithstanding the non-specification of the 
terms and conditions of his deputation, he will be deemed to 
be on deputation with the Federal Government.” 

78. 

In  view  of  the  aforementioned,  I  do  not  find  any  merit  in  any  of 

the  petitions  under  disposal  which  are  accordingly  dismissed  with 

no order  as to costs.
