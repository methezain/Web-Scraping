Order  with signature of Judge  and that of parties or counsel

petitioner.

Through the instant writ petition, the
petitioner,  Muhammad  Asad Hanif, impugns the
interlocutory order dated  21.O9.2O19  passed  by

the learned  Famlly Court, lslamabad,  whereby  his
right to defend  the suit for the recovery  of
maintenance allowance,  etc., was closed under
Section  17-A of the West Pakistan Family Courts
Act, 1964 ("the 1964 Act").
2.  Learned counsel for  the  petltioner
submitted that the impugned order dated
21.09.2019  was unduly harsh; that on 21.09.2019,
the  petitioner had  paid  Rs.20,000/- as
maintenance allowance  for the minor  (Moman
Asad); that the order dated  27.06.2019, whereby
the learned Family Court had ordered for
maintenance  allowance to be paid to respondent
No.1 (Nazish Fakhar)  had been assailed in a writ
petition before  this Court; and that even though
the said order dated 27.06.2019 had not been
suspended by this Court, the learned Civil Court
could not have invoked the penal measure  under
Section  17-A of the ,,|-964 Act. Learned counsel for
the petitioner  prayed for the writ petition to be
allowed in terms of the relief sought therein.
3. 
I have heard  the contentions  of the learned
counsel for the petitioner and have perused the
record  with his able assistance.

W.P. No.3669/2019

lt is not disputed that vide order dated
4. 
27.06.2019,  the learned Family Court  had directed
maintenance allowance  to be paid to respondents
No.1 and 2. The petitioner was also warned  by the
learned Family Court that af the  interim
maintenance was not paid to respondents  No.1
and 2 before the 14u of each month, orders under
Section'17-Aof the',964Act would be passed.
5.  Although  the said order dated 27.06.2019  is
said to have been assailed by the petitioner in a
writ petition filed before this Court, till date the
said order dated 27.06.2019 has not been
suspended. Consequently,  the petitioner  was
bound to show compliance  with the said order  by
paying maintenance  to respondents  No.1 and 2.
Order dated  21.O9.2O19  shows that the petitioner
did pay maintenance  for respondent No.2, but till
date the order for the payment of interim
maintenance for respondent No.1 has not been
complied  with. lt is well settled that mere filing of
a writ petition against  an order for the payment of
the interim  maintenance does not operate as a
suspension of such an order. Since the petitioner
did not show  compliance  with the order for the
payment of interim maintenance  to respondent
No.1, the learned Family Court did not commit any
jurisdictional error by  invoking the penal
provision of Section 17-A of the 1964 Act against
the petitioner.
6. 
ln view of the above,  the instant  petition is
dismissed  in /mrhe. Since the suit for recovery of
maintenance,  etc. is pending since 19.10.2018, it
is expected that the learned Trial Court would
decide the said suit

usly.
