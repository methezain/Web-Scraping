JUDGMENT 

SHAUKAT AZIZ SIDDIQUI, J.---Petitioner Syed Umer Hussain seeks bail in case registered 
vide F.I.R No.381, dated  2-7-2011, offence under section 489-F, P.P.C. at Police Station Margalla, 
Islamabad. 

2.  Briefly,  the  prosecution  story  as  gleans  out  from  the  F.I.R.  is  that  complainant  of  the  case 
namely,  Akhtar  Seth  moved  an  application  to  the  SSP,  Islamabad  with  the  assertion  that 
complainant  is  residing  at  Islamabad  since  long,  having  friendly  relations  with  Syed  Ummar 
Hussain, (present petitioner) since 1983-84. He further stated that petitioner was in dire need of 
Rs.8,00,000 and he while deposing trust upon him paid an amount of Rs.8,00,000 in cash, in the 
month of March, 2010. The petitioner promised him that, he would pay Rs.7,000 per one lac before 
15-8-2011.  The  petitioner  gave  three  cheques  amounting  to  Rs:900,000  which  contained  some 
amount of profit and further promised to pay Rs.7,40,000 later on. Description of cheques given 
in the F.I.R. is as under:-- 

(i) Cheque No.9708755, amounting to Rs.50,000, dated 20-9-2010. 

(ii) Cheque No.9708752, amounting to Rs.450,000 dated 15-3-2011. 

(iii) Cheque No.9708759, amounting to Rs.400,000 dated 15-8-2011. 

All cheques to be drawn at Standard Chartered Bank, Islamabad. 

3. The complainant further narrates that on presentation of two cheques both were  dishonoured 
and on contact, the petitioner refused to make the payment with profit and extended threats of dire 
consequences. 

            
            
  
            
  
  
  
  
  
  
4. The  petitioner  was  arrested  on  18-8-2011. He approached the "Allaqa Judicial Magistrate" 
for grant of bail but his request was declined vide order dated 24-8-2011. Feeling aggrieved, the 
peti-tioner approached learned Sessions Judge, Islamabad who entrusted the bail petition to learned 
Additional Sessions Judge, Islamabad but his petition met the same fate. Resultantly, petitioner 
approached this court for grant of bail after arrest. 

5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that only two cheques amounting to Rs.500,000 
were  presented    to    the    bank    which    according    to    the    sayings  of  the  complainant  were 
dishonoured. He further argued that  offence under section 489-F, P.P.C., does not fall within the 
prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C, therefore, the petitioner is entitled to the concession of 
bail. 

6. Conversely, the learned counsel for the complainant assisted by the learned Standing counsel 
opposed the bail petition, mainly on the ground that number of other cases either against the family 
members of the petitioner or on their behest are registered. He further submits that issuance of 
cheques is admitted, therefore, petition, is liable to be dismissed. 

7. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. The plain reading 
of section 489-F, P.P.C. which is being reproduced hereinbelow, makes it abundantly clear that 
three different punishments are provided which obviously in the facts and circumstances of the 
case can be inflicted as punishment upon any accused obviously on the strength of evidence and 
data available on the record. 

"Whoever dishonestly issues a cheque towards re-payment of a loan or fulfilment of an obligation 
which is dishonoured on presentation, shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend 
to three years, or with fine, or with both, unless he can establish, for which the burden of proof 
shall rest on him, that he had made arrangements with his bank to ensure that the cheque would be 
honoured and that the bank was at fault in not honouring the cheque". 

8. As is evident from above; 

(i) Imprisonment which may extend to 3 years. 

OR 

  
  
  
  
            
  
  
            
(ii) with fine 

OR 

(iii) with both. 

The provision  itself provides a right  to  an  accused to  get  himself  absolved from  the charge by 
adducing evidence, that he made arrangements with his bank to ensure that the cheque was to be 
honoured  and  it  was  the  fault  of  the  bank  not  honouring  the  cheque.  In  my  estimation,  on  the 
conclusion  of  trial  despite  finding  any  accused  guilty  of  the  offence,  there  is  every  likelihood/ 
probability/possibility  that  trial  court  may  impose  fine  of  a  meagre  amount  of  Rs.50  only,  as 
punishment. When asked from  the learned counsel  of the complainant that whether  above said 
possibility emerges from this provision itself or not? The learned counsel very frankly gave the 
answer in affirmative. In such an eventuality, to deprive any person from the concession of bail is 
simply harsh and unjust. 

9. It is well-settled law with the mandate of the dictums of the Superior Courts of the country that 
law has to be stretched in favour of accused and beneficial interpretation has to be made in his 
favour. When there is just a remote possibility that an  accused may not  be awarded imprisonment 
of even one month then propriety  demands that discretion has to be exercised in favour of the 
accused. Now, coming to the other extreme, that maximum punishment provided is up to 03 years, 
which does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C. The honourable Supreme 
Court of Pakistan through different authoritative pronouncements time and again held that when 
an offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause of section 497, Cr.P.C, bail is a rule and 
refusal an exception. In this regard, I seek guidance from 2009 SCMR  page 1488, Zafar Iqbal v. 
Muhammad  Anwar  and  others,  2009  SCMR  page  174,  Shameel  v.  The  State  and  others  2011 
SCMR page 1708, Riaz Jaffar Natiq v. Muhammad Nadeem Dar and others and 2011 SCMR page 
870 Sikandar Zaman v The State and others 

10. On enquiry, the I.O. informed the court that present petitioner has no criminal history and till 
to date even no F.I.R. is registered against him. As such there is no exceptional circumstance on 
the basis of which petitioners request of bail may be declined. Thus for the foregoing reasons, this 
petition is allowed. The petitioner is granted bail subject to furnishing of bail bond of Rs.500,000 
with one surety of like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court.
