Date of Decision:

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J: Through  this writ  petition,

the petitioner has prayed for the following relief:-

(i)

Direction  may  be  issued  to  Respondent  No.1,  to  issue  the

certificate for effectiveness of Divorce under Section 7 of the

Muslim  Family  Law  Ordinance,  1961 

in 

case

MFL/77/2020,  in  pursuance  of  the  irrevocable nature  of

divorce and the statement recorded by Respondent No.1 on

25.11.2020;

(ii)

Declare  that  Respondent  No.2  is  not  the  widow  of  the

Shahzeb  Khan,  the  deceased  son  of  the  petitioner,  and

(iii)

(iv)

accordingly, be declared a divorcee;

Award costs of litigation;

Grant any  other  relief  which  this  Hon’ble  Court  deems

appropriate  in  the  circumstances  of  the  matter,  in  the

interest of justice.

2.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  petitioner’s

real son Shahzeb Khan was married to respondent No.2 on 21.12.2018

and  subsequently  due  to  strained relations,  he  divorced  respondent

W.P. No.869/2021

2

No.2 on 02.07.2019, which has further been clarified through second

and third joint notice dated 14.11.2020; that petitioner’s son Shahzeb

Khan approached the office of Chairman Arbitration Council, UC-15

Lohi  Bher,  Islamabad  for  issuance  of  effectiveness  of  divorce

certificate on 25.11.2020, also recorded his statement on the said date

before  the  Chairman;  that  matter  was  adjourned  to  23.12.2020  and

then 27.01.2021 whereas respondent No.2 never put appearance and

in  the  meanwhile  petitioner’s  son  Shahzeb  Khan  died  on  19.01.2021

prior  to  the  issuance  of  effectiveness  of  divorce  certificate  by  the

Chairman  Arbitration  Council;  that  Chairman  Arbitration  Council

has  refused  to  issue  certificate  though  petitioner  claims  that  once

divorce  has  been  pronounced  the  same  could  not  be  withdrawn,

especially in this case when all three divorce have been pronounced,

even prior to the death of petitioner’s son Shahzeb Khan.

3.

Conversely,  respondent  No.2 has  never  put  appearance before

this Court despite notice and even after adopting substituted mode of

service.  Record  has  been  produced  by  the  Secretary  UC  Lohi  Bher,

Islamabad.

4.

5.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that petitioner’s  son  Shahzeb  Khan

married to respondent No.2 on 21.12.2018 and they were blessed with

one son born on 14.05.2020. Though petitioner’s son pronounced first

divorce  on  02.07.2019 as  per  his  claim  but  second  and  third  divorce

was  announced  on  the  same  date  on  14.11.2020  as  per  record.

Chairman  Arbitration  Council was  approached  on  25.11.2020  for

W.P. No.869/2021

3

issuance of certificate for effectiveness of divorce, who issued notice

to  respondent  No.2  for  23.12.2020 and  27.01.2021  through  registered

post but no one has put appearance on behalf of respondent No.2 and

in  the  meanwhile  petitioner’s  son  Shahzeb  Khan  died  prior  to  the

issuance  of  certificate  on  19.01.2021.  As  per  stance  of  petitioner

certificate  for  effectiveness  of  divorce  be  issued  accordingly,  which

was refused by the Chairman Arbitration Council.

6. When confronted, Secretary UC states that petitioner’s son died

prior  to  the  completion  of  timeline  provided  in  Section  7  of  the

Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961, which prescribed period of 90

days from the day on which notice under sub-section (1) of Section 7

was  delivered  to  the  Chairman. Admittedly,  executor  of  divorce  i.e.

Shahzeb  Khan  was  died  prior  to  the  completion  of  90  days’  time

provided  in  the  law,  therefore,  question  arises  as  to  whether

Chairman Arbitration Council can issue certificate for effectiveness of

divorce,  in  such  scenario,  this  court  has  been  guided  with  the

principles  settled  in  primary  source  i.e.  the  Holy  Quran, whereby

question of iddat, question of talaq has been explained in verse 230 of

Surah  Al-Baqarah  in  which  concept  of  three  divorces  has  been

mentioned. Similarly, last chance to husband for final decision before

expiry of waiting period either to retain or release the wife decently

has also been explained in Surah At-Talaq verse 2, which are the key

principles  for  every  Muslim  to  be  followed  in  letter  &  spirit. The

Quran  has  also  provided  the  mechanism  of  resolution  among  the

husband and wife in Surah An-Nisa verse 28.

W.P. No.869/2021

7. While considering these principles, this court is mindful of the

fact 

that  different  kinds  of

talaq have  been  explained 

in

Muhammadan Law including but not limited to Talaq Ahsan, Talaq

Hasan, Talaq-ul-Biddat, which is irrevocable. Learned counsel for the

petitioner  has  cited  judgments  reported  as AIR  1932  PC  25  (Saiyid

Rashid Ahmad and another VS Anisa Khatun and others), PLD 1982

Lahore 825  (Muhammad  Rafique  VS Ahmad  Yar  and  Another), 1992

SCMR 1273 (Allah Dad VS Mukhtar and another), 1994 SCMR 2098

(Mst.  Zahida  Shaheen  and  another  VS  The  State  and  another),  1996

MLD  1689  (Zubaida  Khatoon  VS  Administrator  UC  Uch  Gillani,

Tehsil  and  District  Bahawalpur  and  another),  PLD  1996  Lahore  65

(Mst. Anila VS Muhammad Munir and others), 2002 MLD 778 (Mst.

Ambreen  Shah  VS  Chairman,  Union 

(Arbitration)  Council/

Administrator,  Union  Committee  and  others),  2006  CLC  1525  (Mst.

Zarina  Begum  VS  Major  Aziz-ul-Haq  and  3  others),  2014  YLR  2315

(Ms.  Roheela  Yasmin  VS  Ms.  Neelofar  Hassan  and  6  others),  2018

CLC  1125  (Muhammad  Afzal  Khan  VS  Chairman  Arbitration

Council  and  another),  2022  SCMR  650  (Munir  Hussain  and  3  others

VS  Province  of  Sindh  and  others) in  order  to  explain  his  point  of

view.

8.

No  doubt  by  and  large  all  the  judgments  explain  qua  the

validity  and  effectiveness  of  divorce  based  upon  different

circumstances in each case even reiterated the stance that Talaq-e-Bain

becomes  irrevocable  at  once.  The  other  principle  highlighted  is  the

concept  of  Section  7  of  the  Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance, 1961,

W.P. No.869/2021

5

which provides a notice in writing by the husband who has divorced

his  wife,  to  the  Chairman and  its  copy  to  the  wife.  The  violation  of

this provision is punishable with simple imprisonment for a term of

one year and fine which may extend to five thousand rupees or with

both. Subsection (3) of this section speaks of talaq being effective until

the  period  of  ninety  days  expires  from  the  day  on  which  notice is

delivered  to  the  Chairman.  Shariat  Appellate  Bench  of  Supreme

Court of Pakistan has also highlighted the concept of notice of talaq to

the Chairman is not mandatory under the Injunctions of Islam in case

Allah Dad supra. Even in case Zahida Shaheen supra Supreme Court

acknowledges  the  failure  to  send  a  notice  to  Chairman  of  local

council does not render the divorce ineffective in Shariah. However,

primary question remains the same as to whether divorce certificate

be concluded if the person who claims for issuance of effectiveness of

divorce certificate dies prior to the completion of 90 days period. This

aspect has in some extent been considered in case Muhammad Afzal

Khan supra. The relevant portion is reproduced as under:-

The  purpose  of  Arbitration  Council  is  to  hold  reconciliation

proceedings between the spouses and if the matter is not reconciled,

the  Chairman  Arbitration  Council  has  to  issue  certificate  of

effectiveness  of  Talaq  after  expiry  of  90  days,  whereas  it  is

prerogative  and  authority  of  the  person,  who  files  the  application

along  with  notices  of  Talaq 

for 

issuance  of  certificate  of

effectiveness of Talaq to withdraw the same before expiry of the 90

days and if the said application is not withdrawn by the applicant

(whether  the  applicant  is  husband  or  wife),  the  Chairman

Arbitration  Council  cannot  refuse 

to 

issue  certificate  of

effectiveness of Talaq, especially in those cases, when the other side

does not appear for reconciliation proceedings. Similarly, if wife (in

W.P. No.869/2021

6

case  of  delegated  right  of  divorce)  has  approached  the  Chairman

Arbitration  Council  for  issuance  of  certificate  of  effectiveness  of

Talaq and notices have been issued to other side, whereas the other

side fails to appear before the Chairman Arbitration Council and in

the meanwhile the applicant (wife) or the person, who applied, dies

then  it  can  only  be  presumed  that  the  executor  of  the  notices  of

Talaq  had  intention  to  pronounce  Talaq  as  the  same  can  be

gathered  from  the documents  of  Talaq.  Reliance  is  placed  upon

Malik  Khalid  Riaz  v.  The  Administrator,  Arbitration  Council,

Hafizabad and another (2016 CLC 1522).

9.

Though  the  above  case  law  is  also  somewhat  different  in one

aspect that 90 days period in case Muhammad Afzal Khan supra has

already  been  elapsed/expired  when  the  person  who  applied  for

issuance  of  certificate  was  alive,  who  later  on  died much  after  the

expiry of the period but before issuance of certificate. This court has

also  gone  through  the  judgment  reported  as 2017  CLC  516  (Mst.

Roheela Yasmin VS Ms. Neelofar Hassan and 6 others), 1994 SCMR

1720 (Mushtaq Ahmed and another VS Mst. Sat Bharai and 5 others),

which  clearly  stipulates  that  time  frame  provided  in  Section  7  is

meant to cooling down the husband in which parties might reconcile

with each other, therefore, phrase used in subsection (3) of Section 7

of  the  Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961  has  great  significance

unless  revoked  earlier  expressly  or  otherwise  shall  not  be  effective

only  the  expiration  of  90  days  from  the  date  on  which  notice  under

subsection  (1)

is  delivered  to  the  Chairman,  therefore,  as  per

Mushtaq Ahmed supra from the facts narrated above the intervening

period of notice before the Chairman Arbitration Council is meant for

reconciliation and procedure provided under the law disseminate the

W.P. No.869/2021

7

intention  of  reconciliation  only  in  which  either  husband  can  revoke

the divorce or reconcile the matter, however, if husband died prior to

the completion  of  90  days  of  service  of  notice talaq had  not  become

effective in terms of Section 7 of the Ordinance.

10. Now  it  has  been  settled  that  in case  of death of  a  husband  or

wife  during  the iddah  period,  the talaq becomes  ceased.  Guidance

may  be  taken  from 2003  YLR  2623 (Sardar  and  3  others  VS

Muhammad Khan alias Malla and 06 others), whereby, the Hon’ble

Lahore High Court has also held that Talaq pronounced by Sultan Ali,

deceased followed by  written  notice  had  not  become  final  in

accordance  with  the  injunctions  of  the  Quran  and  Mst.  Dhami

continued  to  remain  widow  of  Sultan  Ahmad,  deceased,  entitled  to

inherit  his  estate.  Furthermore,  in  recent  judgment  reported  as PLD

2023  [Peshawar]  88 (Mst.  Musarat  VS  Aziz  Ahmad  and  others),

Peshawar High Court held that “in view of reproduction of the relevant

Islamic Law on the subject it is established that in case of Talaq Rajia (Talaq

Ahsan and Talaq Hassan) given during the days of, would have no effect on

the right of widow to have share in the legacy of her husband if her husband

dies before the completion of Iddat period of the wife. Similarly in case of or

which is given on the death bed would also have no effect upon the right of

widow  in  the legacy  of  her  husband  if  such  husband  dies  before  the

completion  of  her  Iddat  period  and  as  in  the  present  case divorce  deed  was

written on 27.08.2018, therefore, the Iddat period would have completed on

27.11.2018 but much before it, her husband died on 03.10.2018, therefore, in

view of the aforesaid exposition of Islamic Law on the subject on the date of

W.P. No.869/2021

8

her  husband death  (03.10.2018) she  was  entitled  for her  Shari share  in  the

legacy  of  her  husband”.  Presumption  is  attached  that  if  the  husband

was  alive, he  may  have  had  the  option  to  revoke  the talaq notice

submitted  to  the  Chairman  Arbitration  Council  before  the  expiry  of

Iddah  period.  Therefore,  such  divorce  ceased  after  the  death  of

husband during the Iddah period and it shall not be established.

11.

In  Pakistan,  the  Muslim  Family  Law  Ordinance,  1961,  has

abolished triple talaq. As per the procedure laid down in section 7, it

largely applied to one or two pronouncements only, excluding three

pronouncements.  However,  some  portions of  section  7  are  in  clear

contravention of the dictates of Islamic law, adding to the peculiarity

of  this  precarious  section.  Court  opinions  on  triple talaq are  split.

Moreover,  the  law  laid  down  in  the  Muslim  Family  Law  Ordinance

does not recognize triple talaq. In our neighboring country (India) the

concept of triple talaq has been abolished and criminalized under the

Muslim  Women  (Protection  of  Rights  on  Marriage)  Act,  2019,  came

into  force  with  retrospective  effect  from  the  19th day  of  September,

2018, followed  by  the  decision  of  Supreme  Court  of  India  in  Civil

No.118 of 2016. The Indian Courts view has always been against the

instantaneous pronunciation  of  triple talaq creating  immediate  and

irrevocable  effect.  In AIR  1979  All.  257 (Marium  VS  Md.  Shamsi

Alam),  Writ Petition No.45  of  1993 (Rahmatullah  VS  State  of  UP),

(1981) 1 GLR 358 (Jiauddin Ahmed VS Anwara Begum), and finally in

Writ  Petition  (Civil)  No.  118  of  2016 (Shayara  Bano  VS  Union  of

India  and  others), 

the 

Indian  Courts gave  verdict against

W.P. No.869/2021

9

pronouncement of triple talaq in creating immediate effect. In Shayara

Bano VS Union of India and others case supra, justice Josephin took the

view as follows:

“The  Holy  Quran  has  attributed  sanctity  and

permanence 

to  matrimony.  However, 

in  extremely

unavoidable  situations,

talaq is  permissible.  But  an

attempt for reconciliation and if it succeeds, then revocation

– are  the  Quranic  essentials  steps  before talaq attains

finality.  In  triple  talaq,  this  door  is  closed,  hence,  triple

talaq is  against  the  basic  tenets  of  the  Holy  Quran  and

consequently,  it  violates  Shariah.  ......  What  is  held  to  be

bad in the Holy Quran cannot be good in Shariah and, in

that sense, what is bad in theology is bad in law as well”

Moreover,  according  to  Ibn  Taimiyah,  Iban  al-Qiyam,  and  the

Shia  Imamiyah,  three pronouncements of  the  word talaq in  one

session  equals  only  one talaq.  Most  Arab,  as  well  as  many  Muslim

states  such  as  Egypt,  Syria,  Jordan,  Iraq,  Sudan,  Morocco,  Kuwait,

Yemen,  Afghanistan,  Libya,  Kuwait,  Qatar,  Bahrain,  and  the  United

Arab Emirates, have, while formulating their own laws, followed Ibn

Taimiyah’s and Ibn al-Qiyam’s positions on this issue.

12.

In view of above, instant writ petition is not made out and same

is hereby DISMISSED as respondent No.2 / Mst. Humera Kiyani, is

widow  of  Shahzeb  Khan  due  to death  of  Shahzeb  Khan  in  Iddah

period  before  conclusion  of  timeline  provided  for  effectiveness  of

divorce.
