Proceedings 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessary. 

05.12.2019  Mr. Sajid Raza Khan, Advocate for the petitioners 

Through 

the 

instant  writ 

petition, 

petitioner  No.1, Awish  Awan,  impugns  the  order 

dated  28.10.2019  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  whereby  her 

application  for  the  recall  of  the  orders  dated 

05.07.2019 and 19.07.2019 was dismissed and the 

matter  was  adjourned  for  final  arguments.  Vide 

order  dated 05.07.2019, petitioners  No.1 's right to 

produce  documentary  evidence  was  closed  and 

vide  order  dated  19.07 .2019,  her  right  of  cross  

examination was closed. 

2. 

The  record  shows  that  on  01.09.2018, 

petitioner  No.1 and  her  daughter  had filed  a suit 

for  "dissolution  of marriage  on the basis  of khula, 

maintenance  of minor  (plaintiff  No.2), recovery  of 

dowry  articles  and  gold  ornaments"  before  the 

learned  Family  Court, 

Islamabad.  The  private 

respondents  contested  the  said  suit  by  filing  a 

written  statement. From the divergent  pleadings of 

the  contesting  parties,  the  learned  Family  Court 

framed  the  issues on  12.12.2018. On 30.04.2019, 

petitioner  No.1 's oral  evidence was  recorded  and 

the  matter  was  adjourned  to  29.05.2019 for  the 

petitioners'  documentary  evidence.  Since  the 

petitioners  were absent on 29.06.2019, the matter 

was  adjourned  to  05.07.2019 on  which  date  they 

also  did  not  appear.  Consequently,  their  right  to 

produce  documentary  evidence  was  closed  and 

the  case  was  adjourned  to  12.07 .2019 on  which 

2 

W.P.No.4211/2019 

date 

the  private 

respondents  evidence  was 

recorded 

through  affidavit.  The  matter  was 

adjourned for the cross-examination of the private 

respondents.  Since 

the  petitioners 

failed 

to 

appear before the Court on 19.07.2019, their  right 

of cross-examination was also closed. The learned 

Family  Court  has  also  observed  that  even  on 

subsequent dates, the  petitioners  did  not appear. 

This  caused the  learned  Family Court  to  observe 

that  the  petitioners'  attitude  with  respect  to  the 

suit  was  casual.  Vide  the  impugned  order  dated 

28.10.2019,  the  learned  Family  Court  dismissed 

the petitioners'  application  for  the  recall  of orders 

dated 05.07.2019 and 19.07.2019. 

3. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioners 

submitted  that  the  petitioners'  absence from  the 

learned Trial Court was for justifiable  reasons and 

unavoidable  circumstances; 

that  the  impugned 

order 

dated 

28.10.2019 

is 

harsh 

and 

unreasonable;  and  that  in  the  interest  of justice, 

the petitioners  should be granted  one opportunity 

to  produce  their  documentary  evidence  and  to 

cross-examine  the  private  respondents.  Learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioners  prayed  for  the  writ 

petition  to  be allowed  in terms  of the  relief  sought 

therein. 

4. 

I  have heard the contentions of the learned 

counsel for  the  petitioners  and  have perused  the 

record  with  his able assistance. The facts  leading 

to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have been set 

out  in  sufficient  detail  in  paragraph  2  above  and 

need not be recapitulated. 

5. 

Since 

the 

impugned 

order 

dated 

28.10.2019  is  an  interlocutory  order,  I  am  not 

inclined to go into the merits of the case lest it may 

prejudice  the  petitioners'  case before  the  learned 

Family Court.

W.P.No.421112019 

6. 

As  Section  14  (3)  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act,  1964("the1964  Act")  expressly 

bars  a  right  of  appeal  or  revision  against  an 

interim  order  passed by a Family Court, the same 

cannot  be  circumvented  by  challenging  such  an 

interim  order  in  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction  of 

the  High  Court.  A  party  aggrieved  by  such  an 

interim  order  has  to  wait  until  a  Family  Court 

passes a  final  order  and then to  challenge  it  in an 

appeal. This  is  because  an  interim  order  merges 

into  the final  verdict.  The purpose  behind  barring 

an appeal or a  revision against an interim  order  of 

the  Family Court  is to  avoid  delays  in disposal  of 

the  cases  by  the  Family  Court.  Since  the  suit 

instituted  by  the  petitioners  is  for  dissolution  of 

marriage  on  the  basis  of  khula,  maintenance  for 

the  minor,  recovery  of  dowry  articles  and  gold 

ornaments, the final decree that may be passed by 

the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court  would  be 

appealable  under  Section  14  of  the  1964  Act. 

Reference  in  this  regard  may  be  made  to  the 

following  case law: 

(i) 

In the case of Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi VS 

Province of  Sindh (1996 SCMR 1165), it  has 

been held as follows:- 

"The statute  excluding a right  of appeal from 
the  interim  order  cannot  be  passed  by 
bringing  under  attack  such  interim  orders  in 
Constitutional jurisdiction.  The party  affected 
has to wait till it matures into a final order  and 
then to attack  it in the proper  exclusive forum 
created  for  the  purpose  of  examining  such 
orders. 11 

(ii) 

In the  case  Mumtaz Hussain alias  Butta  VS 

Chief  Administrator  of  Auqaf.  Punjab (1976 

SCMR 450), it has been held as follows:- 

"As  the  said  Ordinance  has  taken  away  the 
right  of  petitioner  to  interim  relief,  learned 
counsel  submitted  that  this  was  a  ground 
which  entitled  the  petitioner  to  prosecute  a 
writ  petition  despite  the  pendency  of  the 

4 

W.P.No.4211/2019 

proceedings  on 
the  District  Court.  The 
argument  is  misconceived  because  the  writ 
jurisdiction  of  the superior  Courts  cannot  be 
invoked  in  aid  of  injustice  and  in  order  to 
defeat the express provisions  of the statutory 
tew." 

(iii)  In  the  case  of  Mst.  Maham  Shabbir  VS 

Salman Haider  (2014  CLC  330),  this  Court 

held as follows:- 

"9. 
. . .  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its  writ 
jurisdiction  is not sitting  as a Court of appeal, 
or court  of revision. Its jurisdiction  to interfere 
on  the  point  of  fact  is  limited.  Interlocutory 
order  if  does  not  suffer  from  any  illegality, 
malaflde or  is  not  in  excess of jurisdiction  or 
lack of exercise of jurisdiction  or not based on 
misreading,  misconstruing  or  discarding  of 
the  evidence  and  material  on  record  cannot 
be  challenged  in  constitutional  jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, the facts of each case are to be 
considered  separately  and  no  uniform 
principle  can be determined for exercising the 
writjurisdiction.  ,, 

7. 

It 

is  my 

view 

that 

exceptional 

circumstances  which  could  justify  invoking  the 

jurisdiction  of the  High Court  under Article  199 of 

the Constitution would be when the order  or action 

assailed  was  palpably  without 

jurisdiction, 

malafide,  void  or  coram-non-jud/ce.  The  order 

impugned in this  petition  is clearly  interlocutory  in 

nature  and  does  not  dispose  of  the  entire  case 

before  the  Family Court.  The  impugned  order  is 

neither  without  jurisdiction,  nor  malafide,  void  or 

coram-non-judice  so as to warrant  interference  in 

the  Constitutional jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under 

Article  199 of the Constitution. 

8. 

The order  dated  28.10.2019 being  purely 

interlocutory  in  nature  could  not  be  subjected  to 

challenge by filing  a  Constitutional  petition  before 

this  Court  as  it  would  amount  to  defeating  the 

legislative  intent behind Section 14(3) of the 1964 

Act. Therefore, I  am not inclined to interfere  in the 

5 

W.P.No.4211/2019 

said  interlocutory  order  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge, Family Court. 

9. 

Since  I  do  not  find  the  pre-requisites  for 

interference  in  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction  of 

this  Court  with 

the 

impugned  order  dated 

28.10.2019 to be satisfied in the case at hand, the 

instant  writ  petition 

is  dismissed  as  not 

maintainable. The petitioners  will  be  at  liberty  to 

challenge  the  said  order  dated  28.10.2019 in  an 

appeal  against  the  final  order  passed  by  the 

learned Judge, Family Court, if the occasion arises 

for  doing so. There shall be no order  as to  costs.
