MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J:- Through this common 

judgment,  we  propose  to  dispose  of  the  Intra  Court  Appeals 

listed in Schedule-I to this judgment. Most of these appeals have 

been  instituted  by  the  Federation  of  Pakistan,  against  the 

composite  judgment dated  27.07.2015,  rendered  by  the learned 

Single  Bench  of  this  Court,  whereby  the  writ  petitions,  listed  in 

Schedule-II to this judgment, were disposed of.  

2. 

The  writ  petitioners  were/are  all  civil  servants  and 

aspirants  for  promotion  from  Basic  Pay  Scale-20  (“BPS-20”)  to 

BPS-21.  These  petitioners  were  primarily  aggrieved  by  the 

recommendations  made by  the Central  Selection  Board  ("CSB") 

to  the  Prime  Minister  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  ("the

Prime  Minister")  not  to  promote  them  -  they  were  either 

recommended to be superseded or deferred. The prayer clause 

of  Writ  petition  No.2033/2015  titled,  “Dr.  Muhammad  Arif  VS 

Federation of Pakistan” is reproduced herein below:-  

"In view of the above, it is most respectfully prayed that an 
appropriate writ may kindly be issued by this Honourable Court:- 
a)  To set aside impugned 5 marks contained under the so-
called structured formula/OM dated 10.02.2014 and the 
recommendations regarding deferment of the Petitioner 
by declaring as illegal and unlawful because the officers 
of  other  Groups  have  been  promoted  with  lower 
quantification.  

b)  The  official  Respondents  may  kindly  be  directed  to 
consider the Petitioner for promotion to BS-20 with effect 
from the date of occurring of BS-20 vacancy with all 
consequential benefits. 

c)  Any  other  relief  deemed  appropriate  under  the 

circumstances of the case may also be granted." 

3. 

Only a handful of the petitioners had assailed the 'Objective 

Assessment  Form'  annexed  to  the  Office  Memorandum  (“O.M.”) 

No.F.1/1/2012-CP-2,  dated 

10.02.2014, 

issued  by 

the 

Establishment  Division,  Government  of  Pakistan.  The  said 

Objective Assessment Form set out the criteria for the allocation 

of the fifteen (15) discretionary marks to be given by the CSB to 

each  candidate  for  promotion.  Out  of  these  fifteen  (15)  marks, 

upto  5  marks  could  be  given  to  the  officer  under  consideration 

for  promotion  for  his  “Integrity/General  Reputation/Perception” 

on  the  basis  of  his  Performance  Evaluation  Reports  (“PERs”), 

Training Evaluation Reports (“TERs”) and the Opinion of the CSB. 

An  officer  getting  less  than  three  (3) out  of  five  (5)  marks  could 

be  deferred  or  superseded  by  the  CSB  at  their  discretion  but 

with reasons to be recorded in writing. 

4. 

The  learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers,  vide  short  order 

dated 27.07.2015, allowed the said writ petitions. The said short 

order  was  followed  by  detailed  reasons.  For  ease  of  reference 

the said short order is reproduced herein below:-

well as connected writ petition Nos.1359, 1383, 1401, 1415,

2015, 3656 of 2014 and 1855 of 2013 are allowed by declaring 
that formula of award of 15 marks at the disposal of CSB with 
overriding effect of 05 marks and thereby placing the civil 
servants in categories A, B & C is against the dictums laid down 
by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Orya Maqbool 
Abbasi reported as 2014 SCMR 817 and Judgment passed by 
this Court in Iram Adnan's case reported as 2012 PLC (C.S.) 
1355, on the basis of which purportedly new policy was framed. 
The discretion of award of marks by the CSB cannot bring the 
ACRs/TERs evaluation into naught and CSB can only grant 
marks out of 15 at its discretion and marks of quantification to 
be added in making recommendations for promotion. The entire 
process carried out by CSB on the basis of formula introduced 
through Policy of 2012 resulting into deferment/supersession of 
petitioners  is  declared  as  illegal,  without  jurisdiction,  in 
violation of law laid down by the Superior Courts and offensive 
to the accrued valuable rights of civil servants.” 

5. 

The  learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers  also  directed  the 

Establishment Division to reframe the formula by taking away the 

overriding  effect  of  the  marks  to  be  awarded  by  the  CSB  and 

categorization into A, B & C and place the cases before the CSB 

in  the  light  of  the  judgments  of  the  Superior  Courts  within  one 

month. It was also directed that the assessment should be made 

on  the basis  of  the entire performance and  in  case any  tangible 

material questioning the integrity of the civil servant is available, 

he may  be confronted  with  the same, and  thereafter,  an opinion 

regarding  deferment or  supersession  could  be made but not on 

the basis of "hypothesis and reputation in air”. 

6. 

Through  several 

Intra-Court  Appeals  (“ICAs”),  under 

Section 3(2) of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, the Secretary, 

Establishment Division,  Government of  Pakistan,  challenged  the 

said  short  order  dated  27.07.2015.  Alongwith  the  ICAs,  the 

appellants  also  filed  applications  for  the  suspension  of  the  said 

order dated 27.07.2015. Vide interim order dated 02.09.2015, the 

learned  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  directed  status quo  to  be 

maintained  until  the  next  date  of  hearing.  Ever  since  then  a 

meeting of the CSB has not taken place.  

7. 

The  learned  Additional  Attorney-General  (“A.A-G”),  on 

behalf  of  the  Federation,  submitted  that  the  writ  petitions 

instituted  by  the  civil  servants  aspiring  to  be  promoted  to  BPS-

21, were all against the 'recommendations' of the CSB; that none 

of  the  petitioners  waited  for  the  decision  of  the  competent

authority/the  Prime  Minister  regarding  their  promotion;  that  the 

recommendations  of  the  CSB  to  supersede  some  of  the  writ 

petitioners had not been approved by the Prime Minister. All the 

recommendations 

for  supersession  were  converted 

into 

deferments,  and  the  recommendations  of  longer  deferments 

were  converted  into  shorter  deferments  by  the  Prime  Minister. 

Therefore, the petitioners had no cause to invoke the jurisdiction 

of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution 

against the recommendations of the CSB, which were no longer 

in the field.  

8. 

The  objections  to  the  maintainability  of  the  writ  petitions 

raised  by  the  learned  A.A-G  before  the  learned  Single  Bench 

were  reiterated  in  the  appellate  proceedings.  These  objections, 

which  have  been  set  out  in  paragraph  21  of  the  impugned 

judgment are for ease of reference reproduced herein below:- 

"21.  Learned Additional Attorney General next contended that 
in view of foregoing factual position the following are the 
implications for maintainability of the writ petitions: 
a.  Petitions  not  challenging  the  competent  authority's 
order/decision  are  not  maintainable  since  the  order 
holding field has neither been appended therewith nor 
assailed therein to begin with. Admittedly, none of the 
petitioners have sought amendment to their petitions or 
prayer  clauses  therewith  to  pose  challenge  to  the 
order/decision of the competent authority, nor have they 
placed the impugned order on record. All oral arguments 
addressed at the bar on behalf of the petitioners were 
also solely targeted at and challenging the merits of CSB's 
recommendations,  which  has  now  become  a  sheer 
academic exercise. In their present form, the petitions 
failing  to  challenge  the  competent  authority's 
order/decision are not maintainable.  

b.  Petitions challenging the CSB's recommendations which 
are no more holding field - having not been approved by 
the competent authority and having been nullified by the 
competent authority's order/decision of deferment for a 
short period till September, 2015 -- are not maintainable 
as they have become infructuous. 

c.  Even otherwise mere recommendations by the CSB do not 
afford an actionable cause to the petitioners whereby they 
could be considered "aggrieved" within the contemplation 
of  the  Article  199(1)(a)  of  the  Constitution. 
Recommendations alone do not constitute an adverse 
order unless approved by the competent authority and 
resulting in passing of an adverse order as envisaged to 
be passed and communicated to the concerned civil 
servant under paragraph 9 of the Promotion Policy of 
2007 (revised till date). Reliance is placed on 1995 SCMR 
876.

d.  That the superior Courts have been assuming jurisdiction 
in service matters of civil servants pertaining to promotion 
only  where  an  appeal  to  FST  is  not  allowed  under 
paragraph (b) of the proviso to Section 4(1) of STA 1973. 
On the other hand, Article 212(1)(a) of the Constitution 
read  with  Section  3(2)  of  STA  1973  vest  "exclusive 
jurisdiction" in FST "in respect of matters relating to the 
terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  civil  servants". 
Promotion is admittedly part of the terms and conditions 
of service of civil servants. Needless to state that the writ 
jurisdiction  of  this  Hon'ble  Court  invoked  by  the 
petitioners  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  is 
"Subject to the Constitution" as evident from the opening 
phrase of Article 199. Also the relevant Constitutional 
provisions  i.e.  (a)  Article  212(1)  vesting  exclusive 
jurisdiction  in  FST  being  an  administrative  tribunal 
established pursuant to the said Constitutional provision; 
and (b) Article 212(2) creating Constitutional bar on the 
jurisdiction of other Courts including this Hon'ble Court -- 
both  start  with  a  non  obstante  clause  i.e. 
"Notwithstanding  anything  hereinbefore  contained" 
thereby giving it an overriding effect over Article 199 
which is contained before Article 212 in the Constitution. 
This is besides the fact that remedy before FST would by 
definition be considered an alternate adequate remedy 
within  the  contemplation  of  Article  199(1)  of  the 
Constitution.  

e.  Petitioners  cannot  be  considered  "aggrieved"  of  the 
order/decision  of  deferment  made  by  the  competent 
authority, whereas a civil servant must be "aggrieved" of 
an order to be able to agitate the jurisdiction of both FST 
(under Section 4 of STA 1973) and this Hon'ble Court 
(under Article 199(1)(a) of the Constitution). Indeed, in the 
petitioners'  case,  the  competent  authority  has  not 
approved CSB's recommendations of supersession and 
longer  deferment  and  has  instead  passed  an 
order/decision of simple deferment for a short period till 
September, 2015. 
It is now well-settled that promotion cannot be claimed by 
the petitioners as a vested right and in the absence of a 
legal  grievance  as  discussed  in  the  preceding 
submissions, superior Courts of the country have always 
refrained from entertaining writ petitions in such cases. 
Reliance is placed on Government of Pakistan vs Hameed 
Akhter Niazi (PLD 2003 SC 110) which holds at para 22 as 
under: 

f. 

"22.  Section  9  of  the  Act  of  1973  deals with 
"Promotion". It may be regarding "selection post" 
or "non-selection post". In case of selection post as 
involved  in  these  matters,  the  criterion  for 
promotion is merit, while in case of non-selection 
post it is done on the basis of seniority cum fitness. 
No civil servant can ask for promotion as a right, 
and the giving or refusal of promotion is a matter, 
which  is  within  the  exclusive  domain  of  the 
government /executive authority. If a promotion is 
denied to a civil servant it could not be termed as

g.  Only a few petitioners have challenged the Establishment 
Division's Office Memorandum No.F.1/1/2012-CP-2 dated 
10.02.2014  ("OM")  annexed  therewith  the  Objective 
Assessment  Form  for  allocation  of  fifteen  (15) 
discretionary marks to be given by CSB to each candidate 
for promotion. What has been challenged is the provision 
made therein that should a civil servant score less than 
three (3) marks out of five (5) marks allocated to the head 
"Integrity/General  Reputation/Perception",  then  he/she 
may  be  superseded  or  deferred  by  the  CSB  as  its 
discretion with reasons recorded in writing. It may be 
mentioned that any challenge to the aforesaid OM would 
also be maintainable only before FST by way of an appeal 
in its exclusive jurisdiction vested under Article 212(1)(a) 
of the Constitution read with Sections 3(2) and 4(1) of STA 
1973. This is because the OM clearly pertains to the terms 
and conditions of service of civil servants in terms of 
affecting their prospects for promotion. It is now well-
settled that anything affecting prospects for promotion is 
not of itself a determination of fitness for promotion but a 
method  or  means  of  such  promotion  which  can  be 
agitated before FST as part of the right of an eligible 
officer to be considered for promotion. Hence, a writ 
petition would not be competent under Article 199 of the 
Constitution. This is besides the fact that appeal before 
FST would by definition constitute an alternate adequate 
remedy    envisaged  under  Article  199(1)  of  the 
Constitution. Reliance is placed on I.A Sherwani's case 
(1991 SCMR 1041), wherein the august Supreme Court 
authoritatively held at paragraph 10 thereof as under:- 

"10. From the above cited cases, it is evident that it 
has been consistently held inter alia by this Court 
that a civil servant if is aggrieved by a final order, 
whether  original  or  appellate,  passed  by  a 
departmental authority in respect of his terms and 
conditions, his remedy, if any, is by way of an 
appeal before the Service Tribunal even where the 
case involves vires of a particular Service Rule or a 
notification or  the question, whether an accused 
civil servant can claim the right to be represented 
by a counsel before the Enquiry Officer. We are 
inclined  to  hold  that  if  a  statutory  rule  or  a 
notification  adversely  affects  the  terms  and 
conditions of a civil servant, the same can be 
treated as an order in terms of subsection (1) of 
Section 4 of the Act in order to file an appeal before 
the Service Tribunal….. However, we may clarify 
that a civil servant cannot by-pass the jurisdiction 
of the Service Tribunal by adding a ground of 
violation of the Fundamental Rights. The Service 
Tribunal will have the jurisdiction in a case which is 
founded on the terms and conditions of the service 
even if it involves the question of violation of the 
Fundamental rights…" (Emphasis added]

h.  Even otherwise what the OM provides for is something 
belonging  to  the  domain  of  Promotion  Policy  of  the 
Government. It is the discretion of the Government to 
introduce and revise its promotion policy from time to time 
and the Court cannot substitute the policy decision with 
its  own  opinion.  Revised  Promotion  Policy  of  2007 
together with OM dated 10.02.2014 that allocates fifteen 
(15) marks to the discretion of the CSB and the manner in 
which it is done are policy decisions and it is the exclusive 
domain of the government to prescribe qualifications for a 
particular post which is not justifiable as a policy matter 
before this Hon'ble Court. If the Court ventures upon 
giving  its  own  policy  view,  there  will  be  no  end  to 
suggestions on how to structure the Promotion Policy in 
terms of weight assigned to the discretionary marks of 
CSB and the various components thereof. The collective 
wisdom of the members of CSB drawn from amongst 
senior-most  members  of  federal  bureaucracy  also 
including  two  Parliamentarians  (comprising  one 
Opposition member) are to be trusted since no perfect 
objective criteria could ever be made and an element of 
subjectivity based on trust will stay there. Indeed, this 
Hon'ble Court too would not venture upon giving its own 
assessment criteria.  

i)  Lastly, this Hon'ble Court's jurisdiction is governed by the 
Constitution and the law as discussed above. Having no 
jurisdiction in the matter and the petitions being not 
maintainable,  this  Hon'ble  Court  cannot  assume 
jurisdiction on the notion of simply applying its earlier 
judgment(s) to examine if the same were followed or not. 
These are neither contempt nor execution proceedings. 
Such  an  exercise  could  only  be  undertaken  by  the 
forum/Court of competent jurisdiction, which if at all is 
FST in the instant cases."

The  learned  A.A-G  further  submitted  that  there  was  no 

legal  constitutional  infirmity  with  the  O.M.No.F.1/1/2012-CP-2, 

dated  10.02.2014;  that  this  O.M.  was  issued  in  pursuance of  the 

directions to the Establishment Division by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in the case of Orya Maqbool Abbasi (2014 SCMR 817); that 

in  the  case  of  Aftab  Ahmed  Manika  (2015  SCMR  1006),  the 

Hon'ble Supreme  Court had  directed  that  the officers  should  be 

considered  “on  the  basis  of  the  criteria  already  set  for 

determining the fitness or otherwise of the civil servants for 

promotion”;  that  the  law  obligates  the  CSB  to  give  reasons  for 

the supersession or deferment of an officer under consideration 

for  deferment;  that  the  decision  whether  or  not  to  promote  an 

officer to BPS-20 or BPS-21 is based on the collective wisdom of 

the  members  of  the  CSB,  some  of  them  being  high  ranking  civil 

servants;  that  the  proceedings  of  the  CSB  are  carried  out  in  a

meticulous manner leaving no room for error; that the member of 

the  CSB  from  the  province  or  department  of  the  officer  under 

consideration  for  promotion  can  tell  the  other  members  about 

the  ability  and  integrity  of  such  an  officer;  that  the  Superior 

Courts have given the status of ‘rules’ to an O.M., and, therefore, 

the  same  should  not  be  lightly  interfered  with;  that  the  learned 

Single  Bench  had  set  aside  portions  of  the  O.M.  dated 

12.10.2012,  which  had  not  been  challenged  by  any  of  the  writ 

petitioners;  and  that  in  this  way,  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-

not exercise. 

10.  The  learned  A.A-G  apprised  the  Court  of  the  procedure

by  the Law  &  Justice Division,  Government of  Pakistan,  nor  is  it 

required  to  be published  in  the official  gazette.  He provided  the 

copies  of  the  Office  Memoranda  and  Policies  with  respect  to 

promotion of civil servants since 1982.   

11.  The  learned  A.A-G  submitted  that  as  the  law  did  not 

provide a right of appeal against the proceedings of the CSB, the 

ICAs  against  the  Impugned  Judgment  dated  27.07.2015  were 

maintainable. He submitted that the writ petitions challenging the 

vires  of  the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014  suffer  from  laches  and  were 

liable to be dismissed. He submitted that although the said  O.M. 

was  issued  on  10.02.2014,  the  writ  petitioners  challenged  it  in 

June,  2015,  only  when  it  was  made  applicable  to  them,  and  not 

before. He further submitted that in Aftab Manika’s case, the said 

O.M. dated 10.02.2014 was applied to the civil servants.

no  reply  to  the  same  was  given  by  the  Federation;  that  it  is  an 

admitted  position  that  some  of  the  Members  of  the  CSB  had 

boycotted  the  meetings;  that  prior  to  1982,  there  was  no  policy 

for the CSB to recommend promotions; that the Promotion Policy 

of  1982  was  very  comprehensive  and  objective;  that  the  said 

Promotion Policy provided a formula for the quantification of the 

Annual  Confidential  Reports;  that  the said  Promotion  Policy  has 

been substantially amended from time to time; that subsequently, 

the policy of promoting 'the best of the best' was introduced; that 

this policy was struck down by the Hon'ble Lahore High Court in 

Muhammad  Zafeer  Abbasi's  case  (2003  PLC  (C.S.)  503);  that

servant  is  superseded,  he  will  not  be  considered  for  promotion 

unless  he  has  earned  PERs  for  two  full  years,  and  that  if  he  is 

again  superseded,  he  shall 

lose  eligibility 

for 

further 

consideration;  that  paragraph  (a)(iv)  of  the  Revised  Promotion 

Policy/  O.M.  dated  24.10.2007  provided 

that  an  officer 

superseded  earlier  shall  be  considered  after  earning  a 

Performance  Evaluation  Report  for  one  full  year;  and  that  the 

said  O.M.  dated  24.10.2007  withdrew 

the  earlier  Office

supersession and loosing of eligibility for consideration after two 

supersessions.

in pursuance of the 2007 Promotion Policy have been challenged

that  in  all  these  three  cases,  the  decisions  made  on  the 

recommendations of the CSB were struck down and the need for 

structured  discretion  was  voiced;  that  the  critique

guidelines 

for 

the  CSB 

in  making  recommendations 

for 

promotion/supersession/deferment  of  civil  servants;  that  the 

deliberations of the CSB in accordance with the promotion policy 

as  amended  by  O.M.  dated  12.10.2012,  were  also  set  aside  by 

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in Orya Maqbool Abbasi's 

case,  and  the  Government  was  directed  to  undertake  an 

exercise to outline an objective criteria for promotions; that this 

led  the  Establishment  Division  to  issue  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014, 

whereby  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed  to  the 

promotion policy was changed; that as per Serial No.8 of the new 

Objective Assessment Form, the CSB could award upto 5 marks 

for  an  officer's  Integrity/General  Reputation/Perception  on  the 

basis  of  PERs/TERs/Opinion  of  the  Board.  Furthermore,  it  was 

clarified  that  an  officer  under  consideration  getting  less  than 

three out of five marks under this parameter may be deferred or 

superseded by the CSB at their discretion but with reasons to be 

recorded in writing.  

14.  He further contended that the provision of upto five marks 

for  Integrity  etc,  of  a  civil  servant  in  the  Objective  Assessment 

Form is most irrational; that if there is an allegation of dishonesty 

or corruption against a civil servant, he is liable to be proceeded 

against  under 

the  Government  Servants 

(Efficiency  and 

Discipline)  Rules,  1973 ("the  E&D  Rules,  1973");  that  if  there  is 

no such allegation against an officer, but any Member of the CSB 

feels  that  he is  dishonest  or  corrupt,  it is  essential  that  such  an 

officer  should  be  called  and  confronted  with  any  material 

available  with  the  Members  of  the  CSB;  that 

it 

is  not 

understandable  as  to  why  upto  five  marks  have  been  provided 

for different levels of an officer's integrity; that either an officer is 

dishonest  or  he  is  not  dishonest;  and  that  dishonesty  does  not 

have levels.  

15.  He  further  submitted  that  under  the  new  Objective 

Assessment Form, upto five marks can be awarded to an officer, 

inter-alia,  on  the  'Opinion  of  the  Board';  that  this  makes  the 

formula more subjective than objective;  that  the issuance of  the

new  Objective  Assessment  Form  cannot  be 

termed  as 

compliance with  the directions  of  the  Hon'ble Supreme  Court in 

the  case  of  Orya  Maqbool  Abbasi;  that  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  had  directed  for  the  criteria  to  be  more  objective  and 

transparent;  that  this  was  not  done  by  the  Establishment 

Division;  that  the  new  Objective  Assessment  Form  does  not 

reflect  the  true  spirit  of  the  directions  of  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court in Orya Maqbool Abbasi's case; that for the promotion of a 

civil servant, there has to be a subjective evaluation on the basis 

of an objective criteria; that Section 9 of the CSA, 1973, requires 

the  promotion  of  officers  to  BPS-20  and  BPS-21  to  be  made  on 

the basis of the recommendations of the CSB in accordance with 

prescribed  conditions;  that  these  conditions  are  prescribed  in 

Rules 8 and 8-A of the APT Rules, 1973; that earlier the eligibility 

threshold 

for  promotion 

to  BPS-21  was  70  marks,  but 

subsequently it was raised to 75 marks; that the eligibility criteria 

for the promotion of an officer to BPS-21 in the Promotion Policy 

dated  31.10.1982  is  different  from  the  one  set  out  in  the  O.M. 

dated 24.10.2007; that the eligibility criteria under the Promotion 

Policy  of  1982  was  more  objective;  that  under  the  latest  Policy, 

upto 70 marks can be given for PERs, and upto 15 marks can be 

given  for  TERs,  and  15  marks  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  CSB; 

that  the  Objective  Assessment  Form,  which  was  issued  in  an 

effort  to  structure  the  discretion  of  the  CSB  in  awarding  the  15 

marks,  lacks  objectivity;  that  the  overriding  effect  which  the 

award of marks for the integrity of an officer under consideration 

is  to  be  given  by  the  CSB  is  irrational  and  unconstitutional;  and 

that the award of upto 5 marks on the basis of the 'Opinion of the 

Board' brings in arbitrariness in the proceedings of the CSB. 

16.  He  further  submitted  that  the  adverse  remarks  about  an 

officer 

in  his  Annual  Confidential  Report  have 

to  be 

communicated  to  him  within  a period  of  one  month;  that  if  such 

adverse remarks  are not communicated to the officer within the 

said  period,  they  cannot  be  used  against  the  officer;  that  the 

Promotion  Policy  of  2007  provides 

that 

if  disciplinary 

proceedings  are  pending  against  the  civil  servant,  he  is  to  be

deferred;  that  the  Federation  cannot put  every  thing  behind  the 

'collective  wisdom'  of  the  members  of  the  CSB,  because  the 

result  of  such  collective  wisdom  has  been  set  aside  by  the 

Superior  Courts  on  more  than  three  occasions;  and  that  the 

Members  of  the  CSB  cannot  place  reliance  on  the  report  of 

Intelligence  Agencies  in  forming  an  opinion  about  an  officer 

under consideration.  

17.  He further submitted that the writ petitions instituted by the 

petitioners  were  competent,  because  the  CSB  did  not  pass  'an 

order'  which  could  be  challenged  before  the  Federal  Service 

Tribunal;  that  the  CSB  is  a  statutory  authority,  because  it  has 

been  constituted  under  Section  9  of  the  CSA,  1973,  and 

exercises  statutory  function;  that  if  an  appeal  to  the  Federal 

Services Tribunal lay against the issuance of an O.M., then under 

the provisions of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972, the appeals 

filed by the Federation would be rendered incompetent; and that 

where  a  question  of  eligibility  of  a  civil  servant  for  promotion  is 

involved,  he  has  to  seek  his  remedy  before  the  Federal  Service 

Tribunal, however, where the question of suitability or fitness  of 

a  civil  servant  for  promotion  is  involved,  his  remedy  lies  before 

the  Hon'ble  High  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution.  In 

conclusion,  Mr.  Abdur  Rehman  Siddiuqui,  learned  ASC  prayed 

for the appeals to be dismissed.      

18.  Mr.  Muhammad  Shabbir  Bhutta, 

learned  ASC 

for 

respondents No.1 in I.C.A.Nos.368, 372 & 385 of 2015, submitted 

well prepared compendium of case law on the subject. He drew 

our attention to various portion of the judgments in Tariq Aziz-ud-

Din and Muhammad Zafeer Abbasi's case to bring home the point 

that  seniority  is  to  be  given  with  due  consideration  when  an 

officer  is  being  promoted  to  BPS-21  and  that  any  material 

adverse  to  officer  under  consideration  has  to  be  confronted  to 

him by the CSB before drawing a conclusion about his integrity. 

He 

further  submitted 

that  Dr.  Muhammad  Arif 

in  his 

W.P.No.2033/2015  had  also  challenged  the  overriding  5  marks 

for  the  integrity  of  the  officer  under  consideration  brought  in 

through O.M. dated 10.02.2014.

represented  respondent  No.1  in  I.C.A.Nos.391  and  392  of  2015, 

which  arose  from  W.P.No.1511/2015,  submitted  that  the  said 

petitioner had been recommended to be deferred for a period of 

one  year,  but  subsequently,  the  competent  authority  reduced 

this  period  until  the  next  meeting  of  the  CSB,  which  was 

scheduled  to  be  held  in  September,  2015;  that  due  to  the  stay 

order in the appellate proceedings, the meeting of CSB could not 

take  place;  that  the  said  petitioner  had  not  challenged  O.M. 

dated  10.02.2014;  that  the  CSB  had  not  adequately  and 

meaningfully  considered  the  said  petitioner  for  promotion, 

because  his  Objective  Assessment  Form  was  not  filled;  that  as 

per Serial No.157, Volume 1 of the Esta Code (2007), importance 

has been given to seniority to the posts in BPS-21; that in Serial 

No.156,  Volume  1  of  the  Esta  Code  (2007),  the  process  for  the 

quantification  of  confidential  reports  is  provided,  and  incorrect 

quantification  identified  during  the  course  of  inspection  or  re-

verification  entails  a penalty  under  the E&D  Rules,  1973 as  well 

as the liability under the criminal law; that 12 years of service is 

required    for  the  promotion  of  an  officer  to  BPS-19,  17  years  is 

required  for  promotion  to  BPS-20,  and  22  years  is  required  for 

promotion to BPS-21; that during the probationary period of one 

year, the integrity of an officer is carefully watched; that officers 

with  doubtful  integrity  are  not  confirmed;  that  under  Section  11 

of  the  CSA,  1973,  the  services  of  a  probationary  can  be 

terminated without notice; that under Section 9 of the CSA, 1973, 

a  department  is  required  to  see  that  a  civil  servant  possesses 

minimum  qualifications  for  promotion;    that  under  Rule  8  of  the 

Civil  Servants  (APT)  Rules,  1973,  the  department  has  a  vital 

responsibility 

for 

forwarding  a  civil  servant's  name 

for 

promotion; that under Rule 7-A of the Civil Servants (APT) Rules, 

1973,  the competent authority may approve the promotion of an 

officer from the date on which the recommendations of the CSB 

was  made;  that  withholding  of  a  promotion  is  a  penalty  under 

Rule  4(1)(a)(i)  of  the  E&D  Rules,  1973,  whereas  Rules  5  and  6 

provide  the  procedure  for  imposing  such  a  penalty;  that  at  no

petitioner communicated to him; that the competent authority did 

not  agree  with  the  recommendations  of  the  CSB  to  defer  the 

promotion  of  the  writ  petitioner  for  one  year,  and  reduced  the 

same  to  the  next  meeting  of  the  CSB;  and  that  the  discretion 

exercised by the CSB was not structured and was  in violation of 

Article  10-A  of  the  Constitution  as  well  as  the  law  laid  down  by 

the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  cases  of  Abdul  Wahab  & 

another  VS  Secretary,  Government  of  Balochistan  and  another

and  another  (2010  SCMR  442).  The  learned  counsel  gave  to  us 

the list of the several Office Memoranda that were issued by the 

Establishment  Division  from  31.10.1982  to  29.01.2013.  He 

concluded his submissions with the prayer that the Federation's 

appeals should be dismissed.

respondent  No.1 

in  I.C.A.Nos.405,  413,  and  419  of  2015, 

submitted  that  the  recommendations  of  the  CSB  can  be 

challenged  before  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  in  proceedings  under 

Article  199  of  the  Constitution;  that  the  recommendation  of  the 

CSB  is,  in-fact,  an  order  which  can  be  challenged  in  writ 

jurisdiction;  that  under  the  proviso  to  Section  22(2)  of  the  CSA, 

1973,  no  representation 

lies  on  matters  relating  to  the 

determination of fitness of a person to hold a particular post or to 

be  promoted  to  a  higher  post  or  grade;  that  under  the  second 

proviso  to  Section  4(1)  of  the  Service  Tribunals  Act,  1973,  no 

appeal lies to the Federal Services Tribunal, against an order or 

a decision of a departmental authority determining the fitness or 

otherwise  of  a  person  to  be  promoted  to  a  higher  grade;  that 

under  the  second  proviso  to  Section  4(1)(d)(ii)  of  the  Civil 

Servants  (Appeal),  Rules,  1977,  no  appeal  or  review  lies  on 

matters relating to the determination of fitness of a person, who 

hold  a  particular  post  or  to  be  promoted  to  a  higher  post  or

that he was not eligible, then his remedy lies before the Federal

the  ground  that  he  is  not  fit  for  promotion  due  to  his  doubtful 

integrity,  then  his  remedy  lies  before  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  in 

writ  jurisdiction;  that  tangible  and  cogent  material  had  to  be 

available  before  the  CSB  in  order  to  disagree  with  the  views  of 

the Reporting Officer and the Countersigning Officer in the ACRs 

of  an  officer,  who  was  being  considered  for  promotion  by  the 

CSB.  In  making  his  submissions,  the  learned  counsel  placed 

reliance on the law laid down in  Mrs. Iram Adnan and others VS 

Federation of Pakistan and others (2012 PLC (C.S.) 1355), Liaqat 

Ali  Chugtai  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (PLD  2013  Lahore  413), 

Orya  Maqbool  Abbasi  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2014  SCMR 

817),  and  Secretary,  Establishment  Division  VS  Aftab  Ahmed 

Manika (2015 SCMR 1006). 

21.  The  other  learned  counsel  representing  the  respondents  / 

officers  deferred  by  the  competent  authority  adopted  the 

arguments of Mr. Abdur Rehman Siddiqui, learned ASC.  

22.  During the course of the hearing, it was decided that ICAs 

Nos.410 & 427 of 2015, which pertain to the promotion of officers 

from BS-21 to 22 would be heard separately. Therefore, the said 

ICAs were de-clubbed.  

23.  We  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  contesting 

parties and have perused the record with their able assistance.  

24.  We  propose  first  to  deal  with  the  objection  taken  by  the 

learned  A.A-G  as  to  whether  a  petition  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution,  by  a  civil  servant,  is  maintainable  against  the 

recommendations made by the CSB to the Prime Minister.  

25.  Barrister  Masroor  Shah,  learned  counsel  for  respondent 

No.1  in  I.C.A.Nos.376,  377,  383,  387,  415  &  433  of  2015, 

submitted that the recommendations of the CSB were justiciable 

and  a  petition  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  was 

maintainable  against  such  recommendations.  In  support  of  this 

contention, the learned counsel referred to the case of Liaqat Ali 

Chugtai  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (PLD  2013  Lahore  413), 

wherein  the  recommendations  of  the  CSB  were  declared  as 

offensive  to  Article  14  of  the  Constitution.  Furthermore,  the

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  set  aside  the  selection  process 

carried  out  by  the  CSB  by  declaring  it  unconstitutional  and 

illegal. The learned counsel further submitted that in the case of 

Orya  Maqbool  Abbasi  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2014  SCMR 

817), the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held the CSB to 

be a 'semi judicial forum' authorized to examine the cases of the 

officers justly and fairly. Drawing support from the observations 

made in the said two judgments, learned counsel submitted that 

the learned Single Bench did not commit any jurisdictional error 

by  entertaining  writ  petitions  against  the  recommendations  of 

the CSB. 

26.  Be that as it may, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the recent 

case  of  Secretary,  Establishment  Division  VS  Aftab  Ahmed 

Manika  (2015  SCMR  1006)  quoted  with  approval  the  law  laid 

down  in  the case of  Dr.  Habibur  Rehman  VS  The West Pakistan 

Public Service Commission, Lahore (PLD 1973 SC 144), in which 

the appellant had challenged before the Hon'ble High Court, the 

recommendations  of  West  Pakistan  Public  Service  Commission 

and the list in which the name of the appellant was not included 

for promotion. In the said case, it was held as follows:- 

"Yet another aspect of the matter may also be noticed, 
viz.  that  the  recommendations  of  the  Public  Service 
Commission being only advisory in nature and it being open to 
the appointing authority under Article 188 of the Constitution 
not to accept its advice, it is difficult to see how a petition of this 
nature can be maintained. The grievance of the candidate 
would rise only when the Government has made an appointment 
in contravention of the rules; until that time the advice tendered 
by the Commission remains confidential and inchoate and 
cannot give rise to a grievance or a cause of action within the 
meaning of Article 98 of the former Constitution." (Emphasis is 
ours)"  

27.  As  the  judgment  in  the  case  of  Aftab  Ahmed  Manika  is  an 

authority  of  recent  vantage,  we  find  ourselves  bound  to  hold  in 

terms  of  Article  189  of  the  Constitution  that  the  writ  petitions 

against the recommendations simpliciter made by the CSB to the 

Prime Minister were not justiciable and could not be subjected to 

judicial review in terms of Article 199 of the Constitution. Hence, 

the  writ  petitions  challenging  the  recommendations  of  the  CSB

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

allowed.  

28.  Having  said  that  we  feel  that  the  petitions  in  which  O.M. 

dated  10.02.2014  and  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed 

thereto  has  been  challenged,  stand  on  a  different  footing.  This 

O.M.  which  has  the  force  of  law,  has  to  be  examined  on  the 

touchstone  of  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution  as  well  as  the 

Statute  i.e.  the  CSA,  1973,  and  the  law  laid  down  in  the 

judgments  of  the  Superior  Courts.  The  Hon'ble  Superior  Courts 

in the cases of (1) Mrs. Iram Adnan and others VS Federation of 

Pakistan  and  others  (2012  PLC  (C.S.)  1355),  (2)  Liaqat  Ali 

Chugtai  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (PLD  2013  Lahore  413),  and 

(3) Orya Maqbool Abbasi VS Federation of Pakistan (2014 SCMR 

817),  directed  the  Establishment  Division  to  restructure  the 

formula for the award of 15 marks (which were to be awarded at 

the  discretion  of  the  CSB  to  an  officer  for  consideration  for 

promotion), so as to make it more objective, in accordance with 

the  guidelines  provided  by  the  Superior  Courts.  In  all  the  said 

cases  the  Government  had  taken  the  objection  that  exercise  of 

jurisdiction  of  the  Hon'ble  Superior  Courts  under  Article  199 

and/or Article 184(3) of the Constitution was barred under Article 

212 of the Constitution. The Hon'ble Courts had spurned the said 

objection and had examined the manner in which discretion was 

exercised  by  the  CSB  to  award  15  marks  to  an  officer  under 

consideration  for  promotion.  We  are  of  the  view  that  since  the 

Establishment Division  had  been  directed  time and  again  by  the 

Hon'ble Superior Courts to formulate an objective criteria for the 

award of 15 marks by the CSB to an officer under consideration 

for  promotion,  this  Court  does  have  the  jurisdiction  to  examine 

the  vires  of  the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014  and  its  annexure,  which 

according  to  the  A.A-G,  was  issued  in  compliance  with  the 

directions  contained  in  the  said  judgments,  and  to  determine 

whether such directions were, in-fact, complied with.  

29.  Now  it  is  not  disputed  that  BPS-21  is  a  selection  post, 

promotion  whereto  is  made in  accordance with  Section  9 of  the 

CSA, 1973, which is reproduced herein below in its entirety:

said  statute  and  rules,  by  themselves  were  not  enough  to  meet 

the functional requirements, and needed to be supplemented by 

a  comprehensive  and  consistent  set  of  policy  guidelines,  the 

Establishment  Division,  vide  D.O.No.10(2)/81-CP-I(Pt),  dated 

31.10.1982,  framed,  with  the  approval  of  the  President  of 

Pakistan,  comprehensive  guidelines 

for 

the  Departmental 

Promotion  Committees/Central  Selection  Boards  ("the  1982 

Promotion Policy").  

32.  The  qualifications  which  an  officer  in  BPS-20  has  to 

possess, and conditions he has to meet in order to be considered 

to promotion to BPS-21 are set out in the 1982 Promotion Policy, 

as amended from time to time. The qualifications and conditions 

so prescribed are set out herein below:-  

(a)  Qualifying Service: possess 22 years service as an officer 
subject  to  the  provisions  contained  in  Establishment 
Division's O.M. No.1/9/80-R-II (A), dated 2-6-1983. 

(b)  Eligibility threshold: attain a minimum score of 70 marks in 
CRs  in  accordance  with  the  formula  given  in  the 
Addendum. 

(c)  Qualifications: as are prescribed by relevant recruitment 

rules.  

(d)  Relevance of Experience: possess experience relevant to 

the functions of the post being filled by promotion. 

(e)  "Quality  and  Output  of  Work"  and  "Integrity"  marks 
calculated  in  accordance  with  the  formula  in  the 
Addendum shall be a crucial factor in determining the 
comparative merit of an officer.  

(f)  Variety of Experience: the Selection Board should give 
careful consideration to the nature of duties, duration and 
location of posts previously held by the officer. At this 
level,  a  proper  assessment  under  the  criterion  may 
require  some  distinction  between  hard  or  taxing 
assignments (on account of work load or its complexity) 
viz-a-viz  relatively  routine  duties  particularly  in  the 
secretariat. Depending on the posts to be filled, an officer 
possessing  well  rounded  experience  with  adequate 
exposure  to  difficult  assignments  should  normally  be 
preferred.  

(g)  Training: should have successfully completed a regular 
course  at  the  Pakistan  Administrative  Staff 
College/National Defence College. This requirement will 
be waived for officers who: 
(i)  have served as head of a training institution for at  

least one year; or  

(ii)  have served on the directing staff of a training 

institution for at least two years; or  
(iii)  have exceeded the age of 56 years.  

(h)  Top Management Potential: since officers promoted to this 
level may be called upon to hold independent charge of a

33.  The  1982  Promotion  Policy  was  sent  to  the  Chairman, 

Central  Selection  Board,  and  all  Federal  Secretaries,  and  Chief 

Secretaries  of  the Provincial  Governments,  and  was  required  to 

be  kept  in  view  while  processing  promotion  cases.  The  1982 

Promotion Policy was reviewed vide D.O.No.10(3)/84-CP-1, dated 

30.04.1984. It was emphasized that the score for 'integrity' in the 

Annual  Confidential  Report  will  be  a  crucial  factor,  along  with 

'quality and output of work' in determining the comparative merit 

of  officers  for  promotion  to  selection posts.  While considering  a 

civil  servant 

for  promotion, 

the  Departmental  Promotion 

Committee/CSB  was  required  to  clearly  indicate  whether  an 

officer  has  been  cleared  for  promotion,  recommended  for 

supersession  or  the  consideration  of  his  case  was  deferred.  In 

the  Revised  Promotion  Policy,  marks  for  'integrity'  calculated  in 

accordance with the prescribed formula were to be an important 

factor in determining the comparative merit of an officer.  

34.  Vide  O.M.  No.1/1/2001-CP.II,  dated  03.09.2005,  issued  by 

the  Cabinet  Secretariat  (Establishment  Division)  the  'Guidelines 

for  Departmental  Promotion  Committees/Central  Selection 

Boards/the  1982  Promotion  Policy’  were  further  amended  so  as 

to  provide  that  if  a  civil  servant  is  superseded,  he  will  not  be 

considered  for  promotion  unless  he  has  earned  Performance 

Evaluation  Report  for  two  full  years,  and  that  if  he  is  again 

superseded he shall lose eligibility for further consideration.  

35.  Apparently,  from  the  year  2000  onwards,  the  columns  for 

'quality and output of work' and 'integrity' from the Performance 

Evaluation  Report  Forms,  were  omitted.  The  Establishment 

Division,  with  the  concurrence  of  the  Central  Selection  Board, 

also omitted the said columns from the panel performance to be 

considered  by  the  CSB  in  its  meetings  to  be  held  in  the  year 

2003. As such only the quantified score of an officer in the overall 

assessment  was  to  be  taken  into  account  while  considering  the 

promotion of officers to the next grade.

vide  O.M.No.1/3/2007-CP-II,  dated  24.10.2007,  issued  by  the 

Establishment  Division  (“the  2007  Revised  Promotion  Policy”). 

These amendments were made on the basis of recommendations 

made  by  a  Committee  on  Promotion  Policy,  which  was 

constituted to develop a comprehensive criteria for the selection 

for promotion/deferment/supersession which was measurable to 

the extent possible, comparable with regard to the performance 

of  each  officer  on  the  panel,  and  was  based  on  tangible  record 

duly  placed  on  dossier,  and  also  redefine  the  discretion  of  the 

members of the CSB, and to lay down as to how more objectivity 

could be brought in the recommendations of the CSB.

"6…..Presently, the policy for promotion from Grade-20 to 
Grade-21 is that names of three persons are sent to the Central 
Selection Board for consideration for promotion. According to 
the  policy,  70%  marks  are  allocated  to  the  Performance 
Evaluation Reports. Quantification of these 'PERs' is made on 
the basis of reports in previous grades as well as the present 
grade. 15% marks are allocated to Training Evaluation Reports 
and then 15% marks are given by the Central Selection Board. 
As far as marks obtained through Performance Evaluation 
Reports and Training Evaluation Reports are concerned, those 
are always available and can be looked into. As far as marks 
given by the Central Selection Board are concerned, these are 
exclusively discretionary. These marks are to be given with 
reference to Service Record and having been examined the 
comparative marks as well as the performance of the officer in 
the Training Reports. The officer concerned does not appear 
before the Central Selection Board; there is no interview and 
there is every possibility that the Selection Board may not be 
knowing the person, whose case for promotion is before them, 
so some criteria is required to be evolved as these marks can 
not be given simply on the basis of whims. The order of 
Selection  Board  is  required  to  be  based  upon  proper 
reasons….. 
7…..In the present case, no reasons have been given and it is 
not known as to what sort of criteria was adopted by the Central 
Selection Board, for assessing the performance of the officer. 
In  absence  of  any  criteria,  it  would  become  unfettered 
discretion  of  the  Central  Selection  Board  to  recommend 
promotion of one person and refuse the same to another 
similarly placed officer….. 
In the circumstances, I accept this petition; the order of 
8. 
supersession is converted into deferment and the case is sent 
back to the Central Selection Board with the direction to 
determine 'Specific Criteria' for assessing the officer and pass 
a just and fair order, based on reasons."

In the case of Mrs. Iram Adnan and others VS Federation of

Hon'ble  Islamabad  High  Court  against  the  decision  of  the 

competent authority, based on the recommendations of the CSB

the

the  judgment  dated  22.07.2006,  passed  by  the  Federal  Service 

Tribunal, Islamabad. The learned Federal Service Tribunal in the 

said  judgment dated  22.07.2006  had  directed  the Establishment 

Division  to  bring  more  objectivity  in  the  criteria  for  excellence 

and  comparative  merit  by  defining  it  further  and  give  more 

specific, detailed and well argued reasons for denying promotion 

to  an  officer,  who  is  eligible  and  fulfills  the  requisite  criteria, 

length of service, training requirements, relevant experience etc. 

The  said  judgment  of  the  learned  Federal  Service  Tribunal  was 

upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, vide judgment 

dated  25.09.2006,  passed  in  C.P.Nos.836  and  837/2006.  In  this 

judgment, it was held as follows:- 

"2.  Learned D.A.-G., despite our repeated question, could not 
satisfy us on this aspect of the case, therefore, we are of the 
opinion that decision with regard to promotion of the Officer 
cannot be left on the discretion of Members of the Board. There 
must be some criteria to judge the performance of a candidate 
because promotion was denied to the officer on the ground that 
he does not fulfill the criteria. When there is no criteria, then 
how a person can be denied promotion, therefore, the Service 
Tribunal has rightly observed that the Board must bring more 
objectivity in the criteria." 

41. 

In  Iram  Adnan's  case,  this  Court  set  aside  the  formula  for 

the  award  of  the  15  marks  at  the  discretion  of  the  CSB  and 

declared  the  same  as,  inter-alia,  illegal  and  unconstitutional. 

Furthermore, 

the  Establishment  Division  was  directed 

to 

restructure the formula for the award of 15 marks. This judgment 

was  rendered  by  the  Hon'ble 

Islamabad  High  Court  on

superseded  by  the  CSB,  which  had  considered  them  for 

promotion  under  the  2007  Revised  Promotion  Policy  dated

15  discretionary  marks,  taken  in  its  meetings  held  in  November 

2007  and  December  2009,  held  that  "the CSB had consciously 

adopted a policy to place reliance on the personal views and 

impressions  of  the  Members  regarding  the  integrity  and 

reputation of the officers under consideration."  Furthermore,  it 

was held that the process  adopted by the CSB negates  the very 

purpose of a CSB, which was expected to form a collective view 

after 

independent  application  of  mind 

to 

the 

facts  and 

circumstances  of  each  case.  The  CSB  was  required  to 

meticulously  review  the  service  dossier  of  the  officers  under 

consideration  and  formulate  a  collective  opinion.  The  reliance 

placed  by  the  CSB  on  the  personal  opinions  of  the  Members  of 

the  CSB  in  making  recommendations  for  the  supersession  of 

officers  under  consideration  to  the  competent  authority,  was 

held  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  to  be  an  affront  to 

fairness,  due  process  and  Article  10-A  of  the  Constitution.  The 

criteria  that  had  been  developed/evolved  by  the  CSB  for  the 

award  of  the  15  discretionary  marks  was  held  to  be  not 

sufficiently structured or elaborately tailored to reflect thorough 

deliberation  and  proper  analytical  assessment  of  the  officers  to 

be  considered  for  promotion  by  the  CSB.  The  Hon'ble  Lahore 

High  Court  set  aside  the  selection  process  carried  out  by  the 

CSB  in  its  meeting  held  in  September  and  October,  2011  and 

declared  the  same  as  illegal  and  unconstitutional.  Furthermore, 

the  CSB  was  directed  to  formulate  a  well  thought-out  objective 

criterion in accordance with the 2007 Revised Promotion Policy. 

This  judgment  was  rendered  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

on  17.02.2012.  Before  moving  on,  it  is  pertinent  to  reproduce 

herein  below  the  guidelines  given  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High 

Court for the evaluation process by the CSB:- 

"(i)  CSB is free to formulate its opinion on the basis of the 
evidence  before them  which is  the  complete  service

over 15 years and Training Evaluation Reports.  

(ii)  CSB is bound to confront the same to the officer under 
consideration and only after granting an opportunity of 
defence to the said officer regarding the new evidence 
being introduced, place reliance on it and not otherwise.  

(iii)  There is no room for CSB to blindly rely and pass an 
adverse order on the basis of impressions nurtured and 
opinion harboured by Member(s) of CSB. Without the 
Member(s) first tabling the tangible evidence against an 
officer before the Board and then confronting the said 
evidence to the officer under consideration, the Board 
cannot place reliance on the said evidence."  

44.  After  the  judgments  in  Iram  Adnan’s  case  and  Liaqat 

Chugtai’s  case,  the  Establishment  Division,  Vide  Notification 

No.1/1/2012-CP.II, dated 15.08.2012, constituted a Committee to 

consider restructuring the formula for the award of 15 marks by 

the  CSB.  The  main  task  of  this  Committee  was  to  bring  more 

objectivity in the criteria for the award of 15 marks by the CSB in 

the  light  of  observations  made  by  the  Hon'ble  High  Court.  The 

Chairman of this Committee was a member of the Federal Public 

Service  Commission.  He  was  of 

the  view 

that  since 

approximately  900  officers  were  considered  in  each  meeting  of 

the CSB, extending personal hearing to each such officer by the 

CSB  was  not  practicable.  On  the  basis  of  the  recommendations 

of 

this  Committee, 

the 

'Guidelines 

for 

the  Departmental 

Promotion  Committee/Central 

Selection 

Board' 

dated 

31.10.1982,  the  1982  Promotion  Policy,  and  the  2007  Revised 

Promotion Policy dated 24.10.2007, was revised yet again.   

45.  Through  O.M.  No.F.1/1/2012-CP.II,  dated  12.10.2012,  the 

Establishment  Division  revised  and  restructured  the  criteria  for 

the award of the 15 marks reserved for the CSB. The changes so 

made were as follows:- 

"a.  The existing parameters/attributes namely 1) Quality & 
Output of Work; 2) Variety and Relevance of Experience; 
3) Top Management Potential contained in the Guidelines 
for CSB attached with Promotion Policy, 1982 read with 
Revised Promotion Policy, 2007 shall continue to apply 
for  consideration  of  civil  servants  for  promotion, 
deferment and supersession. 

b.  New parameters/attributes namely 1) Integrity /General 
Reputation/Perception  2)  Personality  Profile;  and  3) 
Conduct, discipline & Behavior are added in the said 
Guidelines attached with 1982 Policy.

the Guidelines attached with 1982 Policy as well as 
relevant boxes in the PER Forms, deleted in 2003, are

separately.  

d.  A  new Objective  Assessment  Form (Annexure-A) for

is hereby introduced.  

e.  The said Objective Assessment Form shall be placed 
before the CSB along with panel proforma of every 
officer for his/her objective evaluation by the CSB. The 
Board shall assess each officer on the panel on the basis 
of  said  parameters/attributes.  After  assessment/

f.  Sub Para-b of Para 4 of Revised Promotion Policy, 2007 
provides that the offices securing requisite percentage of 
marks viz: 70 and 75 will be promoted to BS-20 & 21 
respectively. The said para, is modified as under: 

"(b)  The Selection Board shall recommend the 
officers on the penal securing requisite % and 
above in the efficiency index for promotion unless 
deferred (in order of seniority, depending upon the 
number  of  vacancies).  An  officer  meeting  the 
aggregate threshold shall also be superseded if 
CSB places him in Category-C. The senior officers, 
if not recommended for promotion on account of 
low threshold, shall be superseded whereas the 
junior officers if not recommended for promotion 
for want of vacancies shall be deemed not to have 
been considered." 

g.  The aforementioned criteria for award of 15 marks by the 
CSB shall henceforth be treated as part of the Guidelines 
for  Selection  Board  attached  with  Promotion  Policy, 
1982."

47.  Now  it  needs  to  be  seen  whether  the  revision  in  the 

promotion  policies  by  the  Establishment  Division  brought  in 

objectivity  in  the  criteria  for  the  award  of  the  15  discretionary 

marks,  in  compliance  with  the  directions  issued  by  the  Hon'ble 

High  Courts  in  Iram  Adnan’s  case and  Liaqat  Chugtai’s  case.  In 

the  case  of  Orya  Maqbool  Abbasi  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan 

(2014  SCMR  817),  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "Orya  Maqbool’s 

case")  the  petitioner  along  with  other  officers  in  BPS-20,  were 

considered  for  promotion  to  BPS-21  by  the  CSB  in  its  meetings 

held  on  11.02.2013  to  14.02.2013  and  27.02.2013,  and  were 

recommended  to  be  deferred/not  recommended  for  promotion.

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  under  Article  184(3)  of  the 

Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights involving 

questions  of  public 

importance  pertaining  to  outlining  an 

objective  criteria  for  promotion  so  as  to  make  the  civil  service 

rewarding for honest officers and free from political pressures. It 

was  held  that  although  promotion  was  not  a  right,  but  a  civil 

servant, fully qualified for promotion, has a right to claim that his 

case  must  be  considered  for  promotion  strictly  following  the 

eligibility  criteria  laid  down  by  the  Government;  and  that  the 

officers  who  were  not  qualifying  the  eligibility  criteria  for 

promotion  could  be  deferred  but  not  on 

the  basis  of 

discriminatory  reasons,  particularly,  where  such  elements  are 

not  visible  on  the  record.  In  paragraph  43  of  the  said  report,  it 

was held as follows:-  

"43.       As it has been discussed hereinabove the petitioner and 
others  were  subjected  to  arbitrariness  by  the  CSB  while 
considering  their  cases  in  the  months  of  September  and 
October, 2011 and in the meetings of CSB held twice in the 
month of February, 2013, it did not support to its adverse 
decision against the petitioner and others and on having seen 
their record concluded that PERs are fully supporting them and 
in view of the subject reports in their favour, they are eligible to 
be considered for promotion. However, it failed to take into 
consideration such reports for the reasons not tenable in law 
and their such findings were clear violation and departure from 
the promotion policy because once the officers have fulfilled the 
criteria, their cases have to be considered, to assess the fitness 
and suitability to share higher responsibility, mostly based on 
objective criteria, instead of denying promotion to them for the 
subjective consideration, as exactly has happened in this case 
in view of the background which has been noted hereinabove, 
he should have been reconsidered for promotion. Thus, such 
findings, which are whimsical, in violation of the policy and are 
also based on subjective consideration, cannot be endorsed in 
the public interest as well as for the good governance, relating 
to the welfare of the citizens. The officers, if have not been 
considered for promotion on merit against a selection post from 
BS-20 to 21, it would have direct impact on good governance, 
which is necessary to provide for smooth running of affairs in 
the country including protecting the rights of citizens under 
Articles 3 and 9 of the Constitution." 

48.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  in  Orya  Maqbool's  case,  set 

aside the notifications for promotions of all the officers issued in 

pursuance  of  the  recommendations  of  the  CSB.  The  competent 

authority was directed to undertake the process of promotion of 

all the officers strictly according to merit and in accordance with

APT  Rules,  1973,  and  the  Promotion  Policy  as  amended.  The 

Government  was  also  directed  to  undertake  the  exercise  of 

outlining  an  objective  criteria  for  promotion  to  make  the  civil 

servant an honest officer and free from political pressure. It was 

also  observed  that  it  would  be  a  great  achievement  if  it  was 

added  in  the  Policy  to  hold  an  inquiry  of  the  civil  servant  while 

sending  his  case  for  promotion  and  also  examine  his  family 

assets at the time when he joined the service including life style, 

expenses  on  children's  education,  expenses  on  children's 

marriage,  foreign  tours  as  well  as  to  ascertain  the  political 

affiliation of such a candidate to make the bureaucracy free from 

political  affiliation  as  observed  in  the  speech  of  the  Quaid-e-

Azam.   

49.  The  mere  fact  that  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  in  Orya 

Maqbool’s case, directed the Establishment Division to outline an 

objective  criteria  for  promotion,  shows  that  the  Establishment 

Division  had  not  been  able  to  frame  an  ‘objective  criteria’ 

through  O.M.  dated  12.10.2012  for  promotion  process  of  senior 

civil  servants.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  giving  the  said 

direction to the Establishment Division was fully cognizant of the 

directions  given  to  the  Establishment  Division  by  the  Hon'ble 

High  Courts  in  Iram  Adnan’s  case and  Liaqat  Chugtai’s  case,  in 

purported compliance whereof the Establishment Division claims 

to have issued O.M. dated 12.10.2012.

out  of  5  marks  could  be  deferred  or  superseded  by  the  CSB  at 

their discretion but with reasons to be recorded in writing. 

52.  On  05.05.2015,  a  meeting  of  the  CSB  took  place  in  which 

officers  of  BS-19  and  BS-20  were  considered  for  promotion  to 

BS-20  and  BS-21.  After 

the  meeting, 

the  CSB  made 

recommendations to the competent authority/the Prime Minister. 

Several  officers  were  recommended,  superseded  and  deferred. 

Before  the  Prime  Minister  could  take  a  decision  on  CSB’s 

recommendations,  57  writ  petitions  were  filed  before  this  Court 

by  officers,  who  were  either  recommended  to  be  deferred  or 

superseded by the CSB. One of such officers was Dr. Muhammad 

Arif,  Director  General 

(current  charge)  Department  of 

Archaeology  &  Museums,  Government  of  Pakistan,  whose 

promotion  had  been  recommended  to  be  deferred  by  the  CSB. 

He  filed  W.P.No.2033/2015  against  the  recommendations  of  the 

CSB. Furthermore, he had also prayed for the setting aside of the 

five marks for Integrity/General Reputation/Perception contained 

in  the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014.  The  prayer  clause  of  his  writ 

petition has been reproduced hereinabove. As mentioned above, 

vide  short  order  dated  27.07.2015,  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-

Chambers  allowed  all 

the  writ  petitions  challenging 

the 

recommendations  of  the  CSB.  Furthermore,  in  the  detailed 

judgment, the following directions were given:-  

“65.  In this view of the matter, the Establishment Division is 
directed to reframe the formula by taking away the overriding 
effect of the marks to be awarded by CSB and categorization 
into A, B & C and place the cases before CSB in the light of the 
judgments mentioned above, within one month. The assessment 
shall be made on the basis of entire performance and in case 
any tangible material asking question about integrity of civil 
servant is available, he may be confronted with the same and 
then any opinion of deferment or supersession may be made 
but not on the basis of hypothesis and reputation in air. The 
cases of employees of BS-21 for promotion to BS-22 be placed 
before the High Powered Selection Board within one month.”

annexed  to  the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014,  to  the  extent  of  award

examine the vires thereof on the touchstone of law laid down by 

the  Superior  Courts  in  the  cases  of  Iram  Adnan,  Liaqat  Chugtai 

and Orya Maqbool. The directions given by the Hon'ble Superior 

Courts  to  the  Establishment  Division  in  the  said  judgments  to 

frame  an  objective  criteria  for  the  award  of  marks  at  the 

discretion  of  the  CSB  to  an  officer  under  consideration  for 

promotion, have already been referred to above.  

54.  Before we  examine the vires  of  the O.M.  dated  10.02.2014 

and the Objective Assessment Form annexed thereto, especially 

the ‘overriding’ 5 discretionary marks which the CSB can award 

to  an  officer under  consideration  for promotion  for  his  Integrity, 

General Reputation and Perception, we are keen to see how the 

parameters  and  criterion  for  determining  the  fitness  and 

suitability  of  an  officer  for  promotion  is  determined  through 

Office  Memoranda  issued  by  the  Establishment  Division  every 

now and then. We have employed the term ‘overriding’ because 

as  per  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed  to  the  O.M. 

dated 10.02.2014, and as explained by the learned A.A-G, in the 

event the civil servant is given less than 3 marks by the CSB for 

this  Integrity,  General  Reputation  and  Perception,  he  cannot  be 

recommended  to  be  promoted  even  if  he  satisfies  the  threshold 

of achieving more than 75 marks for promotion to BPS-21. Some 

of  the  respondents  before  us  did  achieve  more  than  75  marks, 

but were not recommended to be promoted, because they were 

given  less  than  3  marks  by  the  CSB  for  their  Integrity,  General 

Reputation and Perception.  

55.  Now, Section 9 of the CSA, 1973, inter-alia, provides that a 

civil servant possessing such minimum qualifications “as may be 

prescribed”  shall  be eligible for  promotion  to  a higher  post.  The 

term  “prescribed”  has  been  defined  in  Section  2(f)  of  the  CSA, 

1973,  to  mean,  “prescribed  by  rules”.  And  the  term  “rules”  has 

been  defined  in  Section  2(g)  of  the  said  Act  as  “rules  made  or 

deemed  to  have  been  made  under  this  Act”.  Section  25  of  the 

CSA, 1973, empowers the President or any person authorized by 

the  President,  to  make  such  rules  as  appear  to  him  to  be 

necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of the said

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

Act.  One  of  the  purposes  of  the  CSA,  1973,  is  to  cater  and 

provide  for  the  promotion  of  civil  servants  to  the  next  higher 

grade.  The  conjoint  reading  of  the  said  provisions  of  the  CSA, 

1973,  brings  home  the  conclusion  that  mandate  of  the  said 

statute  was  that  the  minimum  qualifications  required  for  a  civil 

servant  to  be  considered  for  promotion  had  to  be  prescribed  in 

the rules made in exercise of  the power under Section 25 of the 

CSA,  1973.  Therefore,  the  CSA,  1973  does  not  contemplate  the 

prescription for such minimum qualification through an executive 

fiat.  

56.  Section 25 of the CSA, 1973, provides as follows:-  

“25.  Rules. -- (1) The President or any person authorized by the 
President in this behalf, may make such rules as appear to him 
to be necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of 
this Act.  
(2)  Any rules, orders or instructions in respect of any terms 
and conditions of service of civil servants duly made or issued 
by  an  authority  competent  to  make  them  and  in  force 
immediately before the commencement of this Act shall, in so 
far as such rules, orders or instructions are not inconsistent 
with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to be rules made 
under this Act.” 

57.  Office  Memoranda  issued  by  the  Establishment  Division 

prescribing or varying the minimum qualifications required to be 

possessed  by  a  civil  servant  in  order  to  be  considered  for 

promotion,  are  certainly  not  “rules”  framed  under  Section  25  of 

the  CSA,  1973.  Under  Section  25(1)  of  the  CSA,  1973,  the 

President “or any person authorized by the President” can make 

the  rules.  Even  if  the  President  were  to  have  authorized  the 

Establishment  Division  to  make  rules  which  prescribe  the 

minimum  qualifications  for  a  civil  servant  to  be  considered  for 

promotion,  there  is  no  escape  from  the  conclusion  that  such 

minimum qualifications had to be contained in the Rules and not 

in Office Memoranda. It appears that through Rule 8-A of the APT 

Rules, 1973, the power/responsibility to prescribe such minimum 

qualifications 

(completing  of  minimum 

length  of  service, 

attending  training  and  passing  departmental  examination)  has 

been  further  delegated.  Simply  providing  that  promotion  cannot 

be  made  unless  the  officer  concerned  “has completed such

minimum length of service, attended such training and passed 

such departmental examination” does not fulfill the requirements 

of  Section  9(1)  of  the  CSA,  1973.  What  Section  9(1)  had 

mandated was that the “minimum qualifications” for the eligibility 

of a civil servant for promotion should be prescribed by the rules. 

We have not been able to find the minimum qualifications for the 

eligibility of a civil servant for promotion in the APT Rules, 1973, 

or for that matter any other rules framed under Section 25 of the 

CSA,  1973.  Therefore,  the  Federation  would  be  well  advised  to 

consider  prescribing  such  minimum  qualifications  in  the  Rules 

framed under Section 25 of the CSA, 1973. 

58.  Now an O.M. is not issued by the Establishment Division in 

exercise  of  powers  conferred  by  the  CSA,  1973.  Even  the  APT 

Rules, 

1973, 

do 

not 

expressly 

authorize 

the 

Executive/Establishment  Division  to  prescribe  the  minimum 

qualifications for the promotion of a civil servant, through Office 

Memoranda.  An  O.M.  setting  out  the  promotion  policy  or 

guidelines  for  the  Departmental  Promotion  Committees/Central 

Selection  Boards  cannot  be  termed  as  primary  or  delegated 

legislation. At best it is an executive order which has been given 

the  status  of  a  ‘law’  by  virtue  of  judgments  of  the  Superior 

Courts,  including  but  not  limited  to  Orya  Maqbool  Abbasi  VS 

Federation of Pakistan (2014 SCMR 817), Fazli Rehmani VS Chief 

Minister  N.-W.F.P.  (PLD  2008  SC  769),  Sajjad  Ahmad  Javed 

Bhatti  VS  Secretary,  Establishment,  Islamabad  (1996  SCMR 

628),  Secretary  to  the  Government  of  Punjab  VS  Abdul  Hamid 

Arif  (1991  SCMR  628),  Khan  Faizullah  Khan  VS  Government  of 

Pakistan  (PLD  1974  SC  291),  and  Liaqat  Ali  Chugtai  VS 

Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2013 Lahore 413). Although, an O.M. 

has  been  given  the  status  of  'law'  it  is  certainly  not  primarily 

legislation  or  delegated  legislation.  It  does  not  come  within  the 

ambit of a statutory instrument because it is not made in exercise 

of a specific statutory power conferred by the CSA, 1973. 

59.  We were also anxious to know as to why Office Memoranda 

issued after the enactment of the CSA, 1973, have been given the 

status of ‘rules’ in several dicta of the Superior Courts. By virtue

of Section 25(2) ibid, the Office Memoranda which were in force 

immediately  before  the  commencement  of  the  CSA,  1973,  are 

deemed  to  be  rules  made  under  the  said  Act.  This  is  a  saving 

provision  in  the  statute  which  affords  protection  inter-alia  the 

Office  Memoranda  issued  by  a  competent  authority  prior  to  the 

enactment  of  the  CSA,  1973.  Section  25  (2)  is  not  an  enabling 

provision for making Office Memoranda. It also does not give the 

status  of  rules  to  Office  Memoranda  issued  after  the  enactment 

of the CSA, 1973. 

60. 

In  the  case  of  Khan  Faizullah  Khan  VS  Government  of 

Pakistan (PLD 1974 SC 291), it has been held as follows:- 

“This  Court  has  stated  on  several  occasions  that  even 
instructions contained in Memoranda issued by the appropriate 
Government  could  be  regarded  as  being  in  the  nature  of 
statutory rules provided they are expressed with precision and 
yet possess generality so as to be capable on application to a 
large number of cases-See Pakistan v. Abdul Hamid (PLD 1961 
SC 105), Province of West Pakistan v. Din Muhammad (PLD 1964 
SC 21), Government of West Pakistan v. A. A. Aziz (PLD 1966 
SC188) and Habibur Rehman v. West Pakistan Public Service 
Commission (PLD 1973 SC 144). The Resolution issued by the 
Central Government on the 8th November 1950 regarding the 
creation of the Civil Service of Pakistan amply fulfils these 
requirements.” 

61.  Furthermore, in the case of Secretary to the Government of 

Punjab  VS  Abdul  Hamid  Arif  (1991 SCMR  628),  it has  been  held 

as follows:-  

“In this connection, however, it needs to be pointed out that this 
Court  has  held  in  several  decisions  that  where  an  office 
memorandum is expressed in precise terms, which are capable 
of being applied with particularity to a great variety of cases and 
in particular those instructions can be applied with exactness in 
number of cases, the terms of such memorandum should be 
deemed to amplify and adapt the statutory rules in the relevant 
respect  and  be regarded  as  supplementing  them.  See  for 
example Pakistan v. Abdul Hamid (PLD 1961 SC 105)” 

62. 

In the cases of Khan Faizullah Khan and Abdul Hamid Arif, 

the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  holding  that  Office  Memoranda 

issued  by  the  Government  could  be  regarded  as  being  in  the 

nature  of  statutory  rules,  has  placed  reliance  on  the  law  laid 

down  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  judgments  prior  to  the 

enactment of the Civil Servants Act, 1973. Perusal of Section 25 

of  the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973,  does  not  give  the  status  of

statutory  rules  of  the  Office  Memoranda 

issued  after  the 

enactment  of  the  said  Act.  Therefore,  Office  Memoranda  issued 

by  the  Establishment  Division  is  given  the  status  of  law  on  the 

basis of Judge made law. Many other judgments of the Superior 

Courts,  while  treating  the  Office  Memoranda  issued  by  the 

Establishment Division,  as  ‘rules’,  place  reliance on  the law laid 

down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khan Faizullah 

Khan  VS  Government  of  Pakistan  (supra).  For  instance,  in  the 

case  of  Muhammad  Afzal  VS  Government  of  Balochistan  (1995 

PLC  (C.S.)  567),  it  was  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Balochistan  High 

Court as follows:- 

“Before proceeding ahead, it is to be observed that the Policies, 
instructions issued from time to time by the Government could 
be equated with statutory Rules, because it possess generality 
and covers large number of cases on the subject. In following 
this principle, we are fortified by the judgment of Hon'ble 
Supreme Court in Faizullah Khan V. Government of Pakistan 
PLD 1974 SC 291.” 

63.  On the other hand, the Hon'ble Superior Courts in a number 

of  cases  have  given  Office  Memoranda 

issued  by 

the 

Establishment  Division  the  status  of  ‘rules’  in  accordance  with 

the mandate of Section 25 (2) of the CSA, 1973. For instance, in 

the  case  of  Muhammad  Yousaf  VS  Abdul  Rashid  (1996  SCMR 

1297),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  after  making  reference  to 

Section 25 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973, held as follows:-  

“By virtue of subsection (2) of section 25 (ibid), all existing rules, 
orders or instructions in respect of any terms and conditions of 
service of civil servant duly made or issued by a competent 
Authority, in so far it is not inconsistent with the provisions of 
the Act are saved and are to be treated as rules made under the 
Act. The validity of the General Principles of Seniority issued by 
Establishment Division on 31-12-1970 was examined in the light 
of provisions of the Act in Azam Ali's case (supra) and it was 
held that these guidelines not being in conflict with any of the 
provisions of the Act, acquired the force of rules on the strength 
of  the  language  of  section  25(2)  of  the  Act.  The  precise 
observation of this Court in this regard in Azim Ali's case 
(supra), are as follows:-- 

“As the contents of the Circular of December, 1970 are 
not found to be inconsistent with any provision of the Act, 
they acquire force of rules under the Act on the strength 
of section 25, subsection (2) of the Act which provides: 
Any rules, orders or instructions in respect of any terms 
and conditions of service of civil servants duly made or 
issued by any authority competent to make them and 
enforced immediately before the commencement of this

64.  Now,  coming  back  to  the  executive  orders  through  which 

inter alia minimum qualifications for promotion of the senior civil 

servants  to  BPS-20  and  BPS-21,  were  prescribed,  the  first  two 

paragraphs  of  the  cover  letter  (D.O.  No.10(3)/81-CP-I(Pt),  dated 

31.10.1982) 

from 

the  Establishment  Secretary,  Cabinet 

Secretariat  (Establishment  Division),  Government  of  Pakistan, 

through  which  the  1982  Promotion  Policy  was  issued,  read  as 

follows:- 

"The legal frame-work for promotion and its procedures has 
been provided in the Civil Servants Act, 1973 and the Civil 
Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfers) Rules, 1973, 
The Law and Rules, by themselves, are not enough to meet the 
functional requirement and need to be supplemented by a 
comprehensive and consistent set of policy guidelines.  
2.  Comprehensive guidelines for Departmental Promotion 
Committees/Central  Selection  Boards have,  therefore,  been 
framed with the approval of the President. A copy is enclosed."  

65.  This shows that the promotion policy and the guidelines for 

the  CSB  were  issued  in  the  form  of  Office  Memoranda  by  the 

Establishment  Division  so  as  to  supplement  and  meet  the 

functional  requirements  of  the  CSA,  1973,  and  the  APT  Rules, 

1973.  This  was  done  because  the  statute  and  rules  were 

considered 

to  be  ‘not  enough’ 

to  meet 

the  ‘functional 

requirements’. No reference was given to any statutory power in 

exercise  of  which  the  Office  Memoranda  prescribing  the 

minimum  qualifications  for  promotion of  a senior  civil  servant to 

the next higher grade, was given.  

66.  The  Section  Officer  (Career  Planning),  Establishment 

Division  explained  to  us  that  an  O.M.  is  a  mode  through  which 

communication  takes  place  between  all  Ministries  and  Divisions 

of 

the  Government. 

It 

is  a  mode  of 

inter-departmental 

communication.  O.M.  supplementing  the  provisions  of  a  Civil 

Servant  Act,  and  the  APT  Rules,  are  said  to  have  been  made 

under  the  provisions  of  the  Rules  of  Business,  1973,  which  are 

made in  exercise of  the powers  conferred  by  Articles  90 and  99 

of  the  Constitution.  Rule  3(iii)  of  the  Rules  of  Business  provides

It  was  explained  to  us  that  the  process  of  issuing  an  O.M. 

which  is  supposed  to  supplement  the  legal  framework  for 

promotion and its procedure provided in the CSA, 1973, and the 

APT  Rules,  1973,  is  initiated  by  a  Note  from  the  Secretary, 

Establishment Division, requiring a draft to be put up. (Rule 4(2) 

of the Rules of Business, 1973, provides that the Secretary, shall 

be the official head of the Division and shall be responsible for its 

efficient administration and discipline and for the proper conduct 

of business assigned to the Division under Rule 3(iii) for the due 

execution of sanctioned policy). The Section Officer (Policy), and

them  goes  up  the  ladder  to  the  Joint  Secretary  (Policy)  for 

approval,  whereafter  it  goes  to  the  Additional  Secretary,  and 

then  to  the  Secretary  (Establishment  Division).  Thereafter,  a 

summary  with  respect  to  the  issuance  of  an  O.M.  on  the  said 

subject is put up before the Prime Minister. Rule 5(1) of the Rules 

of  Business,  1973,  provides  that  no  important  policy  decision 

shall be taken except with the approval of the Prime Minister, and 

Rule 5(4)  provides  that  no  decision  of  policy  taken  by  the Prime 

Minister  shall  be  varied  or  reversed  or 

infringed  without 

consulting him.) Once the Prime Minister approves the summary 

sent  by  the  Secretary,  Establishment  Division,  regarding  the 

issuance  or  modification  of  an  O.M., 

it 

is 

issued  by  the 

Establishment  Division.  Such  an  O.M.  is  then  circulated  to  the 

other  Divisions  of  the  Government.  Rule  11  of  the  Rules  of 

Business,  1973,  provides  that  no  Division  shall,  without  the 

previous  consultation  of  the  Establishment  Division,  issued,  or 

authorized  the  issuance  of,  any  orders,  other  than  orders  in 

pursuance  of  any  general  or  special  delegation  made  by  the 

Establishment Division, which involves, inter-alia, the following:- 

"appointment to a post in BS-20 and above and equivalent 
whether by initial appointment or promotion  or transfer."

within  the  business  domain  of  the  Establishment  Division  under 

Rule  3(3)  read  with  Entry  No.8(i),  Item  No.11,  of  Schedule-II  to 

the Rules of Business, 1973. Rule 5(15) of the Rules of Business, 

1973,  provides  that  detailed  instructions  for  the  manner  of 

disposal of business in the Federal Secretariat shall be issued by 

the Establishment Division in the form of Secretariat Instructions. 

Paragraph  55  of  the  Secretariat  Instructions  issued  by  the

69. 

In  the  case  of  Tariq  Aziz-ud-Din  reported  as  2010  SCMR 

1301,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  has  emphasized 

that  due  weight  was  required  to  be  given  to  Rules of Business, 

1973,  which  had  a  constitutional  sanction.  And  in  the  case  of 

Amin  Jan  VS  Director-General,  T&T,  reported  as  PLD  1985 

Lahore 81, it has been held that Rules of Business are based on 

public  policy  and  designed  to  effectively  safeguard  State 

interests.  To  act  in  consonance with  these Rules  is  a clear  duty 

cast  on  all  the  Divisions  and  Ministries  of  the  Federal 

Government.  

70. 

In  the  judgment  dated  03.02.2016,  passed  by  Division 

Bench  of  this  Court  in  I.C.A.  No.281/2015,  titled,  “Azra  Jamali 

and  others  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan,  through  Secretary,  M/o 

Commerce and another”, has held that the consistent view taken 

by  the  Superior  Courts  in  Pakistan  has  been  that  the  Courts 

would not interfere in the policy making domain of the executive 

unless the policy was in violation of the Constitution, smacked of 

arbitrariness,  favoritism  and  a total  disregard  of  the mandate of 

law. 

71.  We  now  proceed  to  examine  the  vires  of  the  O.M.  dated 

10.02.2014,  and  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed 

thereto to see whether it satisfies not just the test of legality and 

constitutionality  on  the  touchstone  of  the  law  (including  judge-

made  law)  and  the  Constitution,  but  also  that  of  rationality  and 

reasonability. 

72.  As  per  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed  to  O.M. 

dated  10.02.2014,  the  CSB  can  award  upto  5  marks  for  an 

officer’s  “Integrity/General  Reputation/Perception”  on  the  basis 

of  his  PERs/TERs/Opinion  of  the  Board.  An  officer  getting  less 

than 3 marks out of 5 may be deferred or superseded by the CSB 

at their discretion but with reasons to be recorded in writing. The 

O.M. dated 10.02.2014 does not make it clear as to how many out

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

of  the  5  marks  are  to  be  attributed  to  the  officer’s  PERs,  how 

many  to  his  TERs,  and  how  many  to  the  ‘Opinion  of  the  Board’. 

The said O.M. also does not clarify as to the material /information 

on  which  the  CSB  can  base  its  opinion  on.  In  this  respect  it  is 

vague  and  ambiguous  and  leaves  the  CSB  with  unfettered  and 

unbridled discretion. In the absence of a specific criterion on the 

basis  of  which  the  CSB  is  to  form  its  opinion  about  an  officer’s 

integrity,  there  was  no  way  of  knowing  how  an  officer  was 

assessed by the CSB. As the discretion of the CSB to give marks 

to an officer for his integrity is not structured and is unfettered, it 

leaves the CSB to dish out marks at its sweet will. This is more so 

when  the  marks  for  integrity  are  given  on  the  basis  of  the 

‘Opinion of the Board’ as well as the PERs/TERs of an officer. In 

the  case  of  Babar  Sattar  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2016  CLD 

134)  the  Hon'ble  Islamabad  High  Court  has  held  that  “the 

concept  of  absolute,  unfettered  or  unguided  exercise  of 

discretion by public authorities is treated as alien to the essence 

of the rule of law”.  

73.  A  glance at  how  this  discretion has  been  exercised  by  the 

CSB would be apposite. Before we do this, it is pertinent to bear 

in  mind  that  the  CSB  is  required  to  record  reasons  for  its 

decisions. Paragraph 9 of the O.M. dated 24.10.2007 provides as 

follows:- 

“The officers superseded by the CSB be informed about the 
reasons for his/her supersession/ deferment to enable such 
officers to improve their performance and to complete their 
record/any other deficiency, as the case may be.” 

74.  Vide  O.M.  No.1/3/2007-CP-II,  dated,  19.01.2012, 

the 

Cabinet  Secretariat,  (Establishment  Division)  clarified  that  the 

officers 

who 

have 

been 

recommended 

for 

supersession/deferment  may  be  informed  about  reasons  of  the 

said 

supersession/deferment 

immediately 

after 

the 

recommendations  of  the  DPC/DSB/CSB  have  been  approved  by 

the competent authority.

Messrs  Airport  Support  Services  VS  The  Airport  Manager, 

Quaid-e-Azam  International  Airport  Karachi  and  others  (1998

78.  The vital question that needs to be answered is whether the 

‘reasons’,  as  mentioned  above,  would  satisfy  any  reasonable 

mind  as  to  their  adequacy,  appropriateness  and  sufficiency. 

Furthermore,  do  these  ‘reasons’  carry  any  element  of  clarity  or 

inform the superseded officer about the grounds which prevailed 

over  the  CSB  to  make  a  recommendation  detrimental  to  the 

officer.  “Integrity”  has  been  defined  in  Words  and  Phrases, 

Volume  21B, 

to  mean  “moral  soundness, 

freedom 

from 

corrupting influence or practice”. It is also used as a synonym for 

probity, fidelity and honesty. Do the ‘reasons’ make reference to 

any  material  which  caused  the  CSB  to  conclude  that  the  officer 

lacks  moral  soundness  or  honesty.  Certainly  not!  This  casts  a 

shadow on the manner in which discretion was exercised by the 

CSB.  This  eventuality  could  have  been  averted  had  the 

Establishment  Division  acted  in  accordance  with  the  directions 

contained 

in  the 

judgments 

in  Iram  Adnan’s  case,  Liaqat 

Chugtai’s  case  and  Orya  Maqbool’s  case  and  structured  an 

objective  criteria  on  the  basis  of  which  the  CSB  could  have 

exercised  discretion.  Is  it  not  a  paradox  that  on  the  basis  of  an 

officer’s  PERs  and  TERs,  etc.,  he  obtains  qualifying  marks  for 

promotion, but on the basis of the ‘opinion’ of the CSB regarding 

his  integrity  etc.,  he  is  given  less  then  3  marks  and  denied 

promotion.  

79.  An  officer  against  whom  there  is  nothing  adverse  in  his 

PERs  and  TERs,  cannot  without  sufficient 

tangible  and 

convincing  material  be  relegated  by  the  CSB  by  giving  him  less

than 3 marks for his integrity, as the same  would go against the 

age-old  maxim  "nemo  firut  repente  turpissimus"  (no  one 

becomes dishonest all of a sudden). If any of the members of the 

CSB disagree with the positive remarks about the integrity of an 

officer  in  his  annual  confidential  reports,  they  must  specifically 

record as to why they are not satisfied with the remarks in such 

reports with specific reference to the material which contradicts 

the remarks in such reports. 

80.  An  adverse  opinion  formed  by  the  members  of  the  CSB 

about a particular officer under consideration has to be based on 

tangible material, which would lead any reasonable mind to form 

the  same  opinion.  The  minutes  of  the  meetings  of  the  CSB  and 

the  recommendations  of  the  CSB  to  defer  or  supersede  a 

particular  officer  must  make  explicit  reference  to  the  material 

which  caused  them  to  become  doubtful  about such  the officer’s 

integrity. However, if such material has not, at any material stage 

been, disclosed to the officer, he must first be confronted with it. 

If  such  a process  is  adopted,  the officer  in  question  may  satisfy 

the  members  of  the  CSB  as  to  inaccuracy  or  falsity  of  such 

material/information.  If  the  officer  concerned  is  not  confronted 

with  such  material/information,  it  would  be  a  violation  of  the 

principles of natural justice - audi alteram partem (no one should 

be condemned unheard). The violation of this principle would be 

enough  to  vitiate  even  the  most  solemn  proceedings.  This 

principle  has  been  held  to  have  originated  from  the  Islamic 

Principles of Justice and would be read / considered as a part of 

every  statute.  Audi alteram partem  has  to  be  applied  in  all 

judicial and non-judicial proceedings notwithstanding that a right 

of  hearing  has  not  been  expressly  provided  by  the  statute 

governing  the  proceedings.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  be 

made  to  the  law  laid  down  in  the  cases  of  Hazara  (Hill  Tract)

81. 

In  the  deliberations  of  the  CSB  there  is  no  room  for 

hearsay,  rumors,  generalizations  or  gossip  about  an  officer 

under  consideration  for  promotion.  Any  member  of  the  CSB 

cannot tell the others that a particular officer is known to him and 

that he thinks that the officer’s integrity or reputation is such that 

makes him undeserved for promotion. To immerse an officer into 

the  abyss  of  doubtful  integrity,  it  is  not  enough  that  the  doubt 

fringes on a mere intuition. Mere possibility is hardly sufficient to 

assume 

that 

it  would  have  happened.  There  must  be 

preponderance of probability for the reasonable man to entertain 

the  doubt  regarding  that  possibility.  Only  then,  there 

is 

justification  to  ram  an  officer  with  the  label  'doubtful  integrity'. 

Collective  wisdom  implies  that  the  tangible  information  and 

material on the basis of which such a member of the CSB formed 

an  adverse  opinion  about  an  officer  under  consideration  should 

be placed  before all  the other  members  of  the CSB  so  that  they 

can,  with  an 

independent  application  of  mind,  form  their 

respective  opinions  about  the  integrity  or  reputation  of  such  an 

officer.  At  this  stage,  it  is  apposite  to  refer  to  Liaqat  Chugtai’s 

case, wherein it has been held as follows:-  

“16.  …CSB  comprises  12  members  belonging  to  different 
provinces.  It  is,  therefore,  difficult  to  imagine  that  all  the 
Members knew about the inefficiency and performance of the 
petitioners, hence, personal opinion of some Members seems to 
have been casually adopted by the rest of the Members without 
independent  application  of  mind  and  without  carrying 
out a punctilious  review  of  the  service  record  of  the  petitio-
ners. The process adopted by CSB negates the very purpose of 
a central selection board which is expected to form a collective 
view after independent application of mind to the facts and 
circumstances of each case.” 

82. 

In  the  event,  no  such  material  or  information  is  made 

available, the officer in question cannot be penalized by denying 

him a recommendation for promotion. On the other hand if such

material  or  information  is  available,  the  officer  in  question  must 

be  called  and  confronted  with  it  before  an  opinion  is  formed  by 

the members of the CSB.   

83.  Again  in  Liaqat  Chugtai’s  case,  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High 

Court held as follows:- 

“22. In case, CSB relies on any other evidence collected 
through  its  own source (Promotion Policy does not specifically 
provides for this) in addition to the service dossier of the 
officers, CSB is bound to confront the same to the officer under 
consideration and only after granting an opportunity of defence 
to  the  said  officer  regarding  the  new  evidence  being 
introduced, place reliance on it and not otherwise. …” 

84.  Vide Order dated 01.04.2015, passed in Civil Appeal No.66 

of  2009  titled  Secretary,  Establishment  Division,  Islamabad  VS 

Abdul Ghaffar Mian, the Hon'ble Supreme Court  in paragraphs 2 

and 3 held as follows:- 

"2.  However, since this is the second round of litigation and 
the respondent had retired on 23.07.2009 after superannuation, 
we have no desire to remand the case to the High Court once 
again. We had required the Federation to show us the reasons 
why the respondent was not promoted. The relevant record has 
been produced before us. The ACRs signed and countersigned 
by the responsible senior Police Officers have stated that the 
respondent is a good officer who is also upright and honest. 
Nevertheless, the CSB has variously reported that he does not 
enjoy a good reputation. When we questioned the learned DAG 
to let us know the basis of this opinion formed by the CSB, he 
was not in a position to do so although the entire record of the 
Establishment Division relating to the respondent-officer has 
been produced before us. The same is also being returned to 
the Establishment Division. 
3.  Since there appears to be no apparent basis for the 
opinion formed by the CSB resulting in deferment/supersession 
of the respondent, we find that the opinion of CSB is unjustified. 
We may also state that the Establishment Division needs to look 
into this matter to improve its functioning so those senior 
officers of the Government who have spent more than 30 years 
in government service are not dealt with arbitrarily. If indeed the 
respondent did not enjoy a good reputation, perhaps this should 
have been documented or in the alternate those reporting 
officers should have been questioned who have stated that the 
respondent was a very diligent, competent, honest and good 
officer."  

85.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  Muhammad  Zafeer  Abbasi  VS 

Government  of  Pakistan  (2003  PLC  (C.S.)  503),  the  Division 

Bench of the Hon'ble Lahore High Court held at paragraphs 11 to 

12 of the report as follows:-

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

“11. …We are quite mindful that the Selection Board comprises 
of very high personage with variety of experience and wisdom 
yet they are human beings and cannot be said to be in fallible. 
Such  a  presumption  is  neither  warranted  by  reality  nor 
supported by the history. We are also mindful that we cannot 
substitute the opinion of the Selection Board with over own 
opinion yet we may observe here that if the opinion as to 
unsuitability of an officer for promotion is not based on any 
material the decision based thereon is rendered arbitrary and 
open to correction by this Court in exercise of Constitutional 
jurisdiction." 
12.   No doubt, the petitioner had no right to be promoted yet in 
accordance with section 9 of the Civil Servants Act (No. LXXI), 
1973 he was entitled to be considered for promotion. The right 
contemplated by section 9 aforesaid is neither illusionary nor a 
perfunctory ritual. Withholding of promotion is a major penalty in 
accordance  with  the  Government  Servants  (Efficiency  and 
Discipline) Rules, 1973 and therefore, before a Civil Servant is 
condemned, he has a right to insist that the material on the 
basis of which he is being deprived of promotion should be 
disclosed to him and he should be allowed an opportunity to 
clear himself. The consideration of an officer for promotion is, 
therefore, to be based not only on the relevant law and the rules 
but also on some tangible material which could be lawfully taken 
into consideration therefore, unless the opinion of the Selection 
Board was backed by some tangible material, it could not be 
said  that  the  case  of  the  petitioner  for  promotion  was 
considered in accordance with law. The expression "law" as 
employed in Article 4 of the Constitution is of wider import which 
includes the duty of every public functionary to act in the matter 
justly and fairly and in accordance with the principles of natural 
justice. (Emphasis added).  

86.  As  both  the  Hon'ble  Judges  who  heard  and  decided 

Muhammad Zafeer Abbasi’s case subsequently rose to grace the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan, the said judgment deserves 

the respect and reverence. 

87. 

In the case of Ahmed Saeed Siddiqui VS Pakistan through 

Secretary Establishment (2015 PLC (C.S.) 923), it has been held 

by the Hon'ble High Court of Sindh, as follows:- 

“31. Without 'disclosure' of 'adverse materials' and affording 
opportunity of defence, nevertheless, the petitioners herein 
were deprived of their promotion which act of the Central 
Selection Board [CSB] is not only 'unfair' but also against the 
principles of natural justice and spirit of Articles 4 and 10-A of 
the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as well. In 
this regard the relevant observation from the case of Tanvir 
Ashraf v. Riasat Ali and 5 others [2004 YLR 659] are reproduced 
herein below:--- 

 "… To arrive at a finding adverse to some person, not 
only cogent evidence is required but also that the affected 
person has to be confronted with the material sought to 
be  used  against  him  to  fulfil  the  duty  of  "adequate

opportunity of defense to rebut the material, to satisfy the 
requirement  of  the  principles  of  natural  justice  and 
fairness  to  obey  the  command  of  Article  4  of  the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973."" 

88.  The  principle  is  well-settled  that  an  adverse  report  in  an 

ACR  cannot  be  acted  upon  to  deny  promotional  opportunities 

unless it is communicated to the officer concerned so that he has 

an opportunity to improve his work and conduct or to explain the 

circumstances  leading  to  the report.  Such  an  opportunity  is  not 

an  empty  formality,  its  object,  partially,  being  to  enable  the 

superior  authorities  to  decide  on  a  consideration  of  the 

explanation  offered  by  the  officer  concerned,  whether  the 

adverse  report  is  justified.  The  decision  of  the  CSB  to  give  less 

than  three marks  to  an officer  for his integrity  in  the absence of 

any  adverse  remarks qua  the  integrity  of  such  an  officer  in  his 

PERs  and  TERs,  would  assume  the  character  or  an  “adverse 

remark” about his integrity and obligate the CSB to communicate 

the same to him as well as the material on which such a decision 

is  based,  so  as  to  enable  the  officer  to  offer  an  explanation, 

before  the  CSB  sends  its  recommendations  to  the  competent 

authority. 

89.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  Orya  Maqbool’s  case  has 

observed  that  “Civil Servants of BPS-21 who have to involve 

themselves  in  important  policy  making  and  extensive 

administrative jurisdictions, having possessed proven analytical 

competence, breadth of vision, emotional maturity and such 

other  qualities  as  determined  the potential  for  successfully 

holding posts in top management for achieving the goal for the 

welfare  of  the  general  public,  which  also  deals  with  their 

fundamental  rights  under  Articles  9  and  25  etc.  of  the 

Constitution.”  Therefore,  the  process  for  the  promotion  of  such 

officers  has  to  be  pristine  and  should  carry  no  impression  of 

arbitrariness. We are told that the CSB has to examine hundreds 

of  cases  in  a  few  days  after  every  few  months,  therefore,  each 

and  every  case cannot be given  more than  a certain  time.  Rush 

of  work  should  be  no  excuse  of  not  giving  a  meaningful  and

purposeful attention to each case.  

90. 

If a junior officer is to be promoted and the senior deferred, 

a  comparative  analysis  must  be  carried  out  between  the  two  or 

with  each  of  the officers  over  which  a  junior  is  being  promoted, 

and  reasons  should  be  given  which  would  satisfy  and  convince 

any  reasonable mind  as  to  the  causes  and  factors  due to  which 

the  seniors  are 

ignored.  Such  reasons  must  contain  the 

attributes which are possessed by a junior promoted officer and 

which  the  senior  deferred  or  superseded  officers  are  bereft  of. 

Where the senior officers are so ignored, it is their right to know 

about  their  deficiencies,  which  prevailed  over  the  minds  of  the 

members  of  the  CSB 

in  arriving  at  a  conclusion  not  to 

recommend him for promotion. 

91. 

In  Tariq  Aziz-ud-Din’s  case (2010  SCMR  1301),  it has  been 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as follows:-  

“22. … [T]o ensure justice and openness in view of rule of law it 
becomes obligatory upon the competent authority to decide 
each case on merit taking into consideration the service record 
of the officers BS-21 who were eligible for promotion to BS-22. 
This aspect of the matter requires application of mind based on 
consideration and determination of merit in the light of the 
material explicitly showing as to why the officers who have been 
left  out  were  not  found  to  be  competent/below  merit  in 
comparison to those promoted to BS-22. Such consideration of 
the case and determination of merit for parity of treatment 
becomes all the more necessary and in absence of considering 
the  candidature  of  the  left  out  officers  it  would  alone  be 
tantamount to pick and choose essentially leading us to hold 
that there was no transparency in the exercise of discretion by 
the competent authority.” 

92.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  a  number  of  cases  have 

emphasized  that  the  seven  instruments  that  are  most  useful  in 

structuring  of  discretionary  power  are  open  plans,  open  policy 

statements,  open  rules,  open  findings,  open  reasons,  open 

precedents  and  fair  and  informal  procedures.  The  CSB  in 

exercising its discretion whether to recommend the promotion or 

supersession  or  deferment  of  an  officer  must  bear  the  said 

instruments in mind.  

93. 

In  Aftab  Manika's  case  (2015  SCMR  1006),  it  is, inter-alia,

of the Board. Whether the reports of the Intelligence Agencies 
would be material and, if so, the weight that they deserve are 
matters within the power of the Board. Similarly, the competent 
authority also in its discretion may take into consideration any 
information  while  considering  the  recommendations  of  the 
Board. This power, however, is to be exercised sparingly and as 
mentioned in the Esta Code in exceptional circumstances….."  

94.  Although, it is the prerogative of the CSB whether or not to 

take  the  reports  of  the  Intelligence  Agencies  about  an  officer 

under  consideration  for  promotion,  the  law  laid  down  by  the 

superior courts as regards the veracity, strength and evidentiary 

value of such reports, must be borne in mind. A reference, at this 

stage, to case law on the subject is apposite:- 

(i) 

In  the case of  Muhammad  Akbar  Khan  Hoti  VS  Federation 

of  Pakistan  (2006  PLC  (C.S)  619),  the  writ  petitioner  was 

aggrieved of the decision of CSB to brush aside his annual 

confidential reports and based their decision regarding his 

integrity  on  the  reports  of  the  Intelligence  department.  In 

paragraphs 14 to 16 of the report, it was held as follows:-  

"14.  Anyhow, a report from the Intelligence Department 
with respect to a government servant touching upon his 
integrity  and  work  stands  at  an  inferior  position  as 
invariably this is written by a person of the lowest rank, 
who cannot have a perception which an immediate boss 
of a civil servant may have. Therefore, when ACRs are 
discarded, the intelligence report cannot take their place 
absolutely as this can lead to very dangerous results. At 
the most an overall picture can be drawn ' based on the 
statements in the ACRs and the intelligence reports. 
15.  The CSB in this case has not ascertained from the 
entire material  placed  before it as  to  what was  the 
integrity of the petitioner for purposes of consideration of 
his promotion case. It simply brushed aside the dossier on 
the basis of intelligence report even without asking the 
petitioner any question. It did not even ascertain who was 
the author of the report. If the report was given by a 
Grade IV Officer it would not be wise to depend on such a 
report. 
16.  Therefore, the CSB has not applied its mind to the 
case of the petitioner. As the CSB has not applied its 
mind, this Court has no hesitation in issuing a mandamus 
to the CSB to look into the entire record of the petitioner 
and  then  consider  the  reports  on  the  basis  of  their 
intrinsic value and determine whether this was a fit case 
for promotion or not." 

(ii) 

Similarly  in  the  case  of  Sameen  Asghar  VS  Federation  of 

Pakistan  (2010  PLC  (C.S.)  725),  it  has  been  held  by  the

"7.   The petitioners were superseded by the Central 
Selection Board merely because of the reports of the 
Intelligence  Agencies,  but  admittedly  neither  these 
reports  were  communicated  to  them  nor  were  they 
confronted with same. Even the details whereof were 
neither given in the proceedings of the Central Selection 
Board nor in the comments submitted by the respondents. 
In alike circumstances, this Court vide orders dated 21-3-
2006 and 19-3-2007 passed in Writ Petition No.195 of 2006 
and Writ Petition No. 11 of 2007, the reports of the 
intelligence agencies were declared as without lawful 
authority, supersession made on their basis was set aside 
and the Central Selection Board was directed to consider 
the case of the petitioner without being influenced by the 
report of any intelligence agency." 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Hanif  VS  Islamic  Republic  of 

Pakistan  (2001  YLR  834),  it  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Lahore High Court in paragraph 2 of the Report as follows:- 

"2.   It is the case of the petitioner, that the Government 
of  Pakistan,  has  conducted  a  thorough  investigation 
through the officials of the Intelligence Department for the 
candidates of Nazim and Naib-Nazim; and as per such 
reports, Haq Nawaz/respondent No.5, is found to be a 
police tout, therefore, he is disqualified to contest the 
election and hold the post. According to this plea, it may 
be held, that in law no reliance can be placed upon the so-
called intelligence reports, which are of hearsay nature, 
besides no such report has been placed on the record, 
therefore,  the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  is 
repelled." 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Abdul  Wadood  Khan  VS  Secretary, 

Establishment Division    (2009  PLC  (C.S.)  348),  it has  been 

held by the Hon'ble Islamabad High Court as follows:- 

"5.  The supersession of the petitioner in the meeting of 
the Central Selection Board on the ground of negative 
reports from the Intelligence Agencies particularly when 
petitioner was not confronted with the reports, is illegal. 
The supersession of the petitioner in the year 2005 is, 
therefore, declared to have been made without lawful 
authority having no legal effect. The supersession of the 
petitioner in the year 2005 shall be treated to be a 
deferment." 

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Ashraf  VS  Government  of 

Pakistan  (2007  PLC  (C.S.)  669),  it  has  been  held  by  the

"10.  As to intelligence report qua the integrity of the 
petitioner is concerned, the answer would be that a 
report from the intelligence department with respect to 
a Government servant touching upon his integrity and 
work stands at an inferior position as invariably this is 
written by a person of the lowest rank, who cannot have 
a perception, which an immediate boss of a civil servant 
may have. When ACRs of a civil servant are discarded 
the  intelligence  report  cannot  take  their  place 
absolutely and this can lead to very dangerous results. 
At the most an overall picture can be drawn based on 
the  statements  in  the  ACRs.  and  the  intelligence 
reports. 
11. The non-consideration of ACRs. of civil servant by 
Selection Board on the basis of adverse intelligence 
report "qua" his integrity without asking his explanation 
would mean that Board had not ascertained from entire 
material as to what was the integrity of civil servant for 
the purpose of consideration of his promotion case nor 
the Board has determined that as to who was the author 
of the report and it has been laid down in case of 
Muhammad Akbar Khan v. Federation of Pakistan 2006 
PLC (C.S.) 619 that intelligence report, if given by a 
Grade-IV officer could not be relied upon." 

(vi) 

In the case of High Court Bar Association Bahawalpur VS 

Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2015 Lahore 317), the Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court  set  aside 

the  decision  of  a 

Parliamentary  Committee  constituted  under  Article  175-A 

of  the  Constitution  which  had  based  its  decision  whether 

or  not  to  accept  the  recommendations/nominations  of  the 

Judicial Commission on Intelligence Reports. The reasons 

given by the parliamentary committee in not accepting the 

recommendations  of  the  Judicial  Commission  regarding 

the elevation  of  Judges  to  the High  Court were termed  as 

"frail and cosmetic".  

(vii) 

In  the  case  of  Government  of  Punjab  VS  S.  Tassadaq 

Hussain  Bokhari  (PLD  1986  Supreme  Court  162),  a 

magistrate was issued a show cause notice wherein it was 

alleged  that  he  had  a  persistent  reputation  of  being 

corrupt.  The  competent  authority,  after  affording  him  an 

opportunity of personal hearing, held inter-alia, as follows:-  

“I see no reason to disagree with the report of the 
Directorate  of  Anti-Corruption  Establishment  and  the 
Special Branch who have looked into the allegations 
against the accused officer, independently of each other, 
and have sent separate independent reports, with iden-
tical findings, holding him guilty of the charges spelt out in

422,  423,  424,  425,  426,  427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 

the show-cause notice.” 

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

95.  Consequently,  the  Magistrate  was  removed  from  service. 

Aggrieved by this, the Magistrate agitated the matter before the 

Punjab Service Tribunal, which held has follows:- 

"It is apparent from record without any dispute, that he had 
been removed from service on the basis of secret reports 
provided to the authority by the Special Branch of Police as well 
as by the Anti-Corruption Establishment. … We are of the 
considered opinion that the appellant has been condemned on 
secret reports of the Anti-Corruption Establishment and Special 
Branch  Police,  which  have  based  their  reports  without 
recording any evidence but only by probe at their own end. 
Without  associating  the  appellant  at  any  stage  of  these 
enquiries, submitting at the same time that the appellant was 
reportedly or allegedly or stated to be corrupt.” 

96.  After  holding  so  the  Punjab  Service  Tribunal  set  aside  the 

decision of the competent authority. The Hon'ble Supreme Court 

upheld  the  judgment  of  the  Punjab  Service  Tribunal,  by holding 

inter alia that there is no indication that the secret reports were 

shown  or  the 

factual  contents  thereof  disclosed  to  the 

Magistrate.  

97.  The prime responsibility of the CSB is to consider the cases 

of  the  eligible  civil  servants  in  order  of  seniority,  and  either  (i) 

recommend a civil servant for promotion to the next higher post, 

or  (ii)  recommend  a  civil  servant  for  supersession,  or  (iii)  defer 

the  consideration  of  promotion  of  a  civil  servant  provided  that 

the  consideration  of  a  civil  servant's  promotion  is  deferred  only 

for  the  reasons  set  out  in  the  Promotion  Policy/Guidelines  for 

Departmental Promotion Committees/CSB. 

98.  We noticed that some of the officers that were considered 

for promotion by the CSB were awarded specific marks for their 

PERs,  TERs  and  their  Integrity.  Such  marking  was  not  done  for 

officers, who were recommended by the CSB to be deferred. The 

learned  A.A-G  submitted  that  the  reason  why  marks  were  not 

given  to  the officers  recommended  to  be deferred  was  because 

prior to reaching the marking stage, it was decided by the CSB to 

watch  their  performance.  Now 

it 

is  within  the  realm  of 

possibilities  that  had  marks  for  PERs,  TERs  and  Integrity  being 

given to such officers some may well have satisfied the threshold

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

of 75 marks. The mere fact that they were deferred without being 

subjected  to  marking  on  the  basis  of  their  PERs,  TERs  and 

Integrity  by  the  CSB,  would  imply  that  the  deficiencies  in  their 

work  related  performance  were  so  wanting  that  they  did  not 

deserve  to  be  considered  any  further  in  the  process  underway. 

This makes the communication of the deficiencies in the officers 

along with the reasons for deferring them more imperative. 

99. 

Initially, when the 1982 Promotion Policy (i.e. Guidelines for 

Departmental  Promotion  Committee/CSB 

issued 

through 

D.O.No.10(3)/81/CP-1(Pt), 

dated 

31.10.1982, 

by 

the 

Establishment  Division),  the  CSB  could  defer  the  consideration 

of  promotion  of  a  civil  servant,  only  for  the  following  three 

reasons:- 

"(i)  the  CR  dossier  is  incomplete  or  any  other 
document/information  required  by  the  DPC/CSB  for 
determining a civil servant's suit- ability for promotion is 
not available; or  

ii)  disciplinary or departmental proceedings are pending 
against the civil servant whose promotion case comes up 
for consideration before the DPC /CSB; or  

(iii)  the civil servant is on deputation abroad to a foreign 
government  private  organization  or  international 
agency."  

100.  These  Guidelines  were  subsequently  changed,  vide 

D.O.No.10(3)/84/CP-1, dated 30.04.1984. Three more grounds on 

which a civil servant's promotion could be deferred were added. 

These were as follows:- 

"(iv)  the civil servant does not possess the requisite length of 

(v) 

service; or 
the  civil  servant  has  not  undergone  the  prescribed 
training or passed the departmental examination for 
reasons beyond his control ; or  

(vi)  the civil servant's inter se seniority is subjudice." 

101.  Vide  O.M.  No.1/3/2007-CP-II,  dated  24.10.2007, 

the 

Guidelines  for  Departmental  Promotion  Committees/CSB  were 

again  revised.  On  account  of  the  said  revision,  the  grounds  on 

which  the  CSB  could  defer  the  consideration  of  promotion  of  a 

civil servant, were as follows:- 

"(i)  Not  undergone  the  prescribed  training  or  passed 

departmental examination.  

(ii)  Non submission of Part-I and Part-II of the PER by the 
concerned officer to his reporting officer in respect of his 
service in the present grade and the preceding grade.

(iii)  When the Board considers the record as incomplete, or 
wants to further watch the performance of the officer or 
for any other reason to be recorded in writing.  

(vi)  Disciplinary or departmental proceedings are pending 

against the civil servant.  

(v)  The civil servant is on deputation abroad to a foreign 
government, private organization or international agency.  

(vi)  The civil servant's inter se seniority is subjudice." 

102.  The said O.M. dated 24.10.2007, inter-alia, clarified that the 

civil  servant  whose  promotion  has  been  deferred  will  be 

considered  as  soon  as  the  reason  on  the  basis  of  which  the 

deferment took place ceases to exist.  

103.  The learned Single Judge-in-Chambers had the occasion of 

going through the record of the CSB. The officers in BPS-19 and 

BPS-20  whose  promotion 

to  BPS-20  and  BPS-21  was 

recommended  to  be  deferred  by  the  CSB,  and  the  reasons  for 

such  deferral  are  listed  in  paragraph  35  of  the  impugned 

judgment.  For  ease  of  reference,  this  list  at  Schedule-III  to  this 

judgment.  

104.  Perusal of the said list shows that most of the officers were 

recommended  to  be  deferred,  because  their  work  related 

performance was to be watched/observed for periods extending 

from  six  months  to  one  year.  The  CSB  had  ascribed  the  said 

reason  on  the basis  of  paragraph  (b)(iii) of  the Promotion  Policy 

as  revised,  vide  O.M.  dated  24.10.2007.  The  said  paragraph 

(b)(iii) has been reproduced hereinabove. 

105.  We  are  of  the  view  that  simply  deferring  the  promotion  of 

an  officer  because  the  CSB,  in  its  collective  wisdom,  feels  that 

the  performance  of  an  officer  has  to  be  watched  further,  does 

not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  Section  24-A  of  the  General 

Clauses  Act,  1897.  If  an  officer  is  not  promoted  on  account  of 

some deficiency in his work related performance, it is his right to 

know,  with  sufficient  detail,  what  exactly  that  deficiency  is  and 

which  aspect  of  his  work  related  performance  he  needs  to 

improve upon.  Simply  deferring  an officer  by  telling  him  that  his 

work related performance needs to be watched for six months to 

one year  is  not just vague,  ambiguous,  imprecise and nebulous, 

but unacceptable in the service jurisprudence. The officer whose

promotion  is  deferred  for  such  reasons  would  have  no  way  of 

knowing how and where his work related performance has been 

wanting  or  scarce.  The  Superior  Courts  have  time  and  again 

emphasized  upon  the  requirement  of  reasons  being  given  for 

decisions  made  by  public  functionaries.  Such  reasons  have  to 

contain  the  basis  on  which  public  functionaries  arrive  at  a 

certain  decision,  especially  when  such  a  decision  is  to  the 

detriment  of  the  subject.  In  the  case  at  hand,  the  decision  to 

recommend the promotion of an officer to be deferred, is in-fact, 

a  decision  not  to  promote  him  at  a  particular  stage.  When  an 

officer  is  not  promoted,  when  his  similarly  placed  peers  are 

promoted,  this  is  detrimental  and  harmful  to  him.  The  assertion 

of the learned A.A-G that when such an officer is promoted after 

six  months  or  one  year  after  the  deferment,  he  will  regain  his 

seniority, is no consolation to such an officer and is no excuse for 

not  providing  him  reasons  with  specificity  and  detail  as  to  the 

areas or facets where his work related performance is deficient. 

The  decision  to  recommend  the  promotion  of  an  officer  to  be 

deferred  cannot be at  the whims  or  impulses  of  the members  of 

the CSB.  Such  a decision  has  to  be  backed  by  tangible material 

showing 

the  deficient  performance  of 

the  officer  under 

consideration for promotion.  

106.  We were told by the learned A.A-G that the writ petitioners, 

whose  promotion  had  been  recommended  to  be  deferred  could 

not  be  termed  as  aggrieved  persons,  because  the  competent 

authority  had  reduced  the  periods  of  their  deferral  to  shorter 

period  and  that  they  would  be  considered  for  promotion  in  the 

next  meeting  of  the  CSB.  This,  in  our  view,  is  a  self-defeating 

argument.  If  the  members  of  the  CSB  considered  that  the  work 

related performance of a particular officer needed to be watched 

for  one  year,  one  wonders  what  prevailed  over  the  competent 

authority to substantially reduce the period of deferral of such an 

officer.  

107.  The  law  laid  down  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan in Orya Maqbool's case that the "decision with regard to 

the promotions of the officers cannot be left on the discretion of

the Members of the Board; there must be some criteria to judge 

the performance of a candidate because promotion was denied 

to an officer on the ground that he does not fulfill the criteria." 

108.  We are of the view that this principle is squarely applicable 

to the officers, who are recommended to be deferred by the CSB. 

The  CSB  can  recommend  the  promotion  of  an  officer  to  be 

deferred only and only for the reasons set out in the  O.M. dated 

24.10.2007, under the heading "Conditions for Deferment". Now 

Clause (iii) of the "Conditions for Deferment" does not reflect any 

criteria  or  objectivity.  Just  like  the  superior  courts  had  earlier 

directed  to  restructure  the  criteria  for  the  award  of  the  15 

discretionary  marks  available  to  the  CSB,  we,  without  setting 

aside the same or making a declaration with respect to it, expect 

that the said Clause (iii) of the "Conditions for Deferment" would 

also  either  be  reworded  or  supplemented  by  the  Establishment 

Division  so  as  to  bring  in  more  objectivity  and  transparency  in 

the  process. 

In  expressing 

this  expectation,  we  remain 

conscious of the limitations on our jurisdiction under Article 199 

of the Constitution, especially in view of the law laid down by the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  Dr. Imran Khattak VS Ms. 

Sofia Waqar Khattak (2014 SCMR 122). 

109.   Paragraph  2  of  the  O.M.  dated  24.10.2007  provides  that 

"the civil servant whose promotion has been deferred will be 

considered  as  soon  as  the  reason  on  the  basis  of  which 

deferment took place ceases to exist."  Now  when  the  civil 

servant  is  not  informed  about  the deficiency  in  his  work  related 

performance with specific details, how is he to know which area 

of  his  performance  he  has  to  improve  upon.  Unless  there  is 

specific material  on  the basis  of  which  the members  of  the CSB 

feel that the work related performance is deficient and not up to 

the  mark,  and  needs  to  be  watched  for  another  year  or  so,  the 

decision of the CSB to recommend the promotion of an officer to 

be deferred cannot be termed as reasonable or rational.   

110.  Confining  the  reason  for  recommending  an  officer's 

promotion  to  be  deferred  so  as  to  "watching his work related 

performance"  for  six  months  or  one  year,  without  further  ado

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

leaves the door ajar to arbitrariness and abuse of discretion. The 

process  by  which  the  CSB  comes  to  the  conclusion  to  defer  an 

officer has to be purposeful and meaningful. 

111.  Some  of  the  reasons  on  which  an  officer's  promotion  can 

be  deferred  are  where  he  has  not  undergone  the  prescribed 

training  or  passed  departmental  examinations;  where 

disciplinary  or  departmental  proceedings  are  pending  against 

the civil servant; where the civil servant is on deputation abroad; 

where  the  civil  servant's  inter  se  seniority  is  subjudice.  This 

information about a civil servant ought to be in the knowledge of 

the department to which he belongs. We fail to understand as to 

why  the  case  of  an  officer,  suffering  from  the  disabilities 

mentioned  above,  is  sent  by  his  department  to  the  CSB  for 

consideration  for  promotion.  Regardless  of  these  disabilities,  if 

the  department  sends  the  case  of  such  an  officer 

for 

consideration  for  promotion  to  the  CSB,  and  the  CSB  comes  to 

know  about  such  disabilities,  then  obviously  such  an  officer 

cannot be considered for promotion. 

112.  The  learned  A.A-G  submitted  that  an  error  has  been 

committed  by 

the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers 

in 

paragraph  54  of  the 

impugned 

judgment  and  that  while 

reproducing 

the  O.M.  dated  12.10.2012, 

the  Objective 

Assessment  Form  which  had  been  issued  along  with  the  said 

O.M. has not been reproduced, rather the Objective Assessment 

Form  which  had  been  issued  along  with  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014, 

had been reproduced.  

113.  We  do  not  think  that  anything  turns  on  this  error  because 

the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014  other  than  replacing  the  Objective 

Assessment Form did not bring about any substantive change in 

the O.M. dated 12.10.2012. There is no denying the fact that the 

cases  of  the writ petitioners  were considered  by  the CSB  under 

the  promotion  policy  as  amended  by  the  O.M.  dated  12.10.2012 

and  the  Objective  Assessment  Form  issued  along  with  the  O.M. 

dated 10.02.2014.

the respondents impugning the O.M. dated 10.02.2014, were not

maintainable, because the petitioners could have filed an appeal 

before  the  Federal  Services  Tribunal  in  terms  of  Rule  4(1)(a)  & 

(b)  of  the  Civil  Servants  (Appeal)  Rules,  1977,  which  are 

reproduced herein below:- 

"4. (1)   A civil servant shall be entitled to appeal to the appellate 
authority from an order passed by an authority which -  

alters to his disadvantage, his conditions of service, 

(a) 
pay, allowances or pension; or  
(b) 
interprets to his disadvantage the provisions of any 
rules whereby his conditions of service, pay, allowances or 
pension are regulated; or "  

115.  Learned A.A-G submitted that if the writ petitioners were of 

the  view  that  the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014  and  the  Objective 

Assessment  Form  annexed 

thereto,  altered 

to 

their 

disadvantage,  their  conditions  of  service  or  interpreted  to  their 

disadvantage 

the  provisions  of  any  rules  whereby 

their 

conditions of service were regulated, they could have challenged 

the  vires  of  the  said  O.M.  and  its  annex  before  the  Federal 

Services  Tribunal.  This,  we  feel  is  a  self-defeating  argument, 

because  if  the  remedy  of  an  appeal  under  the  said  law  was 

available  to  the  writ  petitioners,  then  under  the  proviso  to 

Section  3(2)  of  the  Law  Reforms  Ordinance,  1972,  the  appeals 

filed by the Federation against the judgment dated 27.07.2015 of 

the  learned  Single  Bench  of  this  Court  would  be  liable  to  be 

dismissed  as  not  maintainable.  However,  since  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  contesting  parties  have  argued  their  cases  on 

merits  stretched  over  a  period  of  25  dates  of  hearing,  we  feel 

that a decision on merits is warranted. 

116.  We  are  of  the  view  that  the  requirement  for  marks  to  be 

given  to  an  officer  for  his  integrity/general  reputation  on  the 

basis  of  the  ‘Opinion  of  the  Board’,  went  contrary  to  the 

directions  given  to  the  Establishment  Division  by  the  Superior 

Courts  in  the  judgments  in  Iram  Adnan’s  case,  Liaqat  Chugtai’s 

case  and  Orya  Maqbool’s  case.  Furthermore,  the  same  was 

unguided  and  was 

likely 

to 

lead 

to  arbitrariness  and 

unreasonableness. Hence, judgment of the learned Single Bench 

to the extent of “declaring that the formula of award of 15 marks 

at the disposal of the CSB with overriding effect of 05 marks” is

                          432, 433 & 449 of 2015 

upheld.  Consequently,  the direction  made by  the  learned  Single 

Bench  to  the  Establishment  Division  to “reframe the formula by 

taking away the overriding effect of the marks to be awarded by 

CSB” is also upheld.  

117.  None of the writ petitioners had challenged the O.M. dated 

12.10.2012  or  the Objective  Assessment Form  annexed  thereto. 

Therefore,  the  judgment  of  the  learned  Single  Bench  to  the 

extent of making a declaration with respect to the said O.M. is set 

aside.  This,  we  hold  in  view  of  the law  laid  down  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Dr.  Imran  Khattak  VS  Ms.  Sofia 

Waqar  Khattak  (2014  SCMR  122). It  may,  however,  be observed 

that  in  the  presence  of  the  O.M.  dated  12.10.2012,  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court,  in  Orya  Maqbool’s  case,  had  directed  the 

Government  to  undertake  an  exercise  to  outline  an  objective 

criteria for the promotion.  

118.  For the foregoing reasons, we hold as follows:-  

(i) 

The  appeals  arising  from  the  impugned  judgment  dated 

27.07.2015,  whereby  the  writ  petitions 

in  which  the 

recommendations  of  the  Central  Selection  Board  were 

challenged, are allowed. Therefore, the writ petitions to the 

extent  of  challenging  the  recommendations  of  the  Central 

Selection Board, are dismissed as not maintainable.  

(ii) 

The appeals from impugned judgment dated 27.07.2015 to 

the extent of striking down the O.M. dated 10.02.2014, and 

the  Objective  Assessment  Form  annexed  thereto,  to  the 

extent of the five (5) overriding discretionary marks, which 

the Central Selection Board could grant to an officer under 

consideration  for  promotion  for  his  Integrity,  General 

Reputation and Perception, are dismissed.  

(iii)  The  impugned  judgment  dated  27.07.2015  to  the  extent  of 

striking down the O.M. dated 12.10.2012, is set aside.  

(iv)  The entire process  carried  out by  the  CSB  on  the basis  of 

the  O.M.  dated  10.02.2014  and  the  Objective  Assessment 

Form annexed thereto resulting in the recommendations of 

the  CSB  for  the  deferment/supersession  of  the  officers 

under  consideration  for  promotion,  is  declared  to  be
