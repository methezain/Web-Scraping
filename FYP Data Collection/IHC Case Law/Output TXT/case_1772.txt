MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI.  I:  The petitioner

through  this criminal  miscellaneous petition  has prayed  for his

post arrest bail in case  FIR No.118,  dated 29.03.2019,  under

Sections 324,337-F(iii)  PPC,  P.S. Bhara  Kahu,Islamabad.

2. 

Brief facts referred  in the instant FIR lodged on the

complaint  of Mst. Musarrat  Bibi/respondent  No.2 are that

the petitioner on 29.03.2019  fited upon  the complainant  and

caused iojrry on her left arm. Pursuant to lodging of the

aforesaid FIR against the petitioner, the petitioner moved

post  arrest bail petition before  the leamed Judicial Magistrate

(East), Islamabad,  which was dismissed on 27.09.2019.

The petitioner  thereafter  approached the learned Additional

Sessions  Judge (East),  Islamabad by filing of post  arrest  bail

petition, which  was dismissed  on 10.70.2019. Hence,  the

instant criminal miscellaneous  petition.

3. 

Leamed  counsel  for petitioner contended that the

petitioner  has falsely  been implicated  in the instant case by

the complainant  on the basis of family grudges;  that  the post

arrest bail to the co-accused  has been  extended  by the leamed

Additional  Sessions  Judge, therefore,  petitioner is also

entitled  for the same  relief; that no offence is made out

Crl.  Misc.N  o.6 I 6-8 201. I

l2l

against the petitioner and the case is one of the further

inqury and probe;  that  the investigation  of the  case has  been

completed  and the petitioner is no more required  for further

investigation,  therefore,  the petitioner may kindly be

admitted  to post arrestbail.

4. 

Conversely, learned counsel  for complainant  as well

as the learned State  Counsel while opposing  the instant  post

arrest bail petition contended  that the petitioner  is nominated

accused  in the FIR with specific  role and sufficient  material is

available on record to connect the petitioner with the

commission  of offence, that too is distinguishable  from  the

co-accused  who had  been granted bail by the lower Court,

therefore,  the petitioner  is not entifled  for concession  of bail.

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard,  record  perused.

Perusal of record reveals that petitioner  is nominated

in case FIR No.118. dated  29.03.2019,  under Section  324,

337-F(iii) PPC, P.S. Bhara  Kahu, Islamabad  lodged  on the

complaint  of Mst.  Mussarat  Bibi/respondent  No.2  with the

allegations  that on 29.03.2019,  at about 12:45  a.m. in the dghU

the petitioner  resorted  to firing using pistol and injured  the

complainant.

7. 

The tentative  assessment of record reveals that

complainant's  sister namely Sajida Hussain  is married with

petitioner, who deserted  her after  physical assault  as the

petitioner  wanted  to enter into another marriage,  which

constrained  Sajida  Hussain  to live with her sister  i.e.

complainant.

8. 

As per medical report the complainant  received

firearm injury  at medial aspect of left arm, midway  between

elbow  and shoulder joint,  which is close to heart.  The

complainant  was  treated in the Federal  Government  Services

Hospital at about 1.:25 a.m., on29.03.201,9, which reflects  that

she was immediately taken to hospital and  the FIR has been

Crl. Misc.N o.68 6-82.0L9

t3l

lodged promptly.  The motive is clear  at this stage  and  the

identity  of petitioner  is clearly established  from the record.

9. 

Besides the above referred position,  the conduct of

petitioner  has also been highlighted from record  as he

remained  absconder  and when the police  tried  to arrest  him

on 07.08.201.9,  he escaped by use of force with the help of

other 1.0 co-accused  persons nominated in another  criminal

case i.e. FIR No.545/2019,  dated 07.08.2019,  under Section

353, 186, ?24, 225, 382, 506,'1,47,  1,49  PPC,  P.S. Saddar  Beruni,

Rawalpindi. Such conduct of petitioner reveals  his desperate

character, although  the record  also  reflects the previous

involvement of  petitioner in  different  criminal cases.
The petitioner  intended  to  commit  murder of  the

complainant and injured the complainant by using firearm

weapon, and as such, the witresses  also corroborated  his

presence,  therefore,  no gtound of further  inquiry exists  in his

favour.  Moreover,  the offence  with which the petitioner has

been charged  falls within the prohibitory  clause of Section

497  Cr.P.C. and granting bail to the petitioner, at this stage,

would amount to trivialize and playdown  the gravity of

offence allegedly committed  by him.

10.  The claim of the petitioner  regarding benefit of the

rule of consistency  is not applicable  in this case as the

petitioner  has been nominated with specific role of causing

grievous  injury to the complainant through  fire-arm,

whereas the other co-accused  persons,  who have been

granted  bail after arrest have  not been assigned  with such

role  of fuir& hence applicability  of the rule of consistenry is

not seen in this regard.

11. 

In view of above, the petitioner is not entitled  for

concession  of post arrest bail. Resultanfly, the instant  bail

petition is hereby  DISMISSED.

with matter is directed to conclude the trial within the period

of six (06)  months,  under intimation  to

Court.
