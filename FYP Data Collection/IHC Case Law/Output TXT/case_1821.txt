S. No. of

proceedings

Order with signature of Judge and that of
parties or counse! where necessary.

Date of
order I
proceedings
L8.O7.2019.  Mr. Habib ur Rehman Chohan, Advocate

for the Petitioner.

Through the instant petition, the

Petitioner  seeks  direction to respondent  No.1

to produce  his minor  children.

2

The facts, in brief, are that the

petitioner is married  to respondent No.1 and

out of wedlock a child was born. Due to
differences between the  parties, the

relationship went sour. In  the  referred

backdrop, respondent No.1 filed an application

under Section 49L Cr.P.C seeking possession

of the minor child, which  was granted  by

learned Additional  Sessions Jude, Islamabad.

After the same, the petitioner  filed an

application under Section 491 Cr.P.C  against

respondent No.1, which was dismissed.

Meanwhile,  an application  was also filed by

the petitioner  under Sections 25 and 12 of

Guardian  and Wards Act.

W.P. No.2650  of 2019

2

3

Learned counsel for the petitioner,

inter-alia,  contends that the petitioner has not

seen  his child for long, hence  respondent No.1
be directed to produce him. It was further

contended  that though  proceedings under

Guardian and Wards Act are pending,  since

the Courts shall be closed, therefore, it  is

desirable that an order under  Section  49t

Cr.P.C.  be passed.

4

Arguments advanced  by learned

counse! for the petitioner have been  heard
and the documents placed on  record

examined  with his able assistance

5

Admittedly,  the proceedings before

the Family Court under the Guardian and

Wards Act are pending  between the petitioner

and respondent  No.1. The petitioner,  if desire

to  see his child, can always make an

application seeking the said relief. The order

passed by respondent  No.2 does not suffer

from any error of law or jurisdiction.

6

For the above mentioned  reasons,

the instant petition is without merit and is

dismissed in limine.
