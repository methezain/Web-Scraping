Proceedings 

01.11.2021  Mr.  Muhammad  Wajid  Hussain  Mughal, 

Advocate for petitioner.  
Mr.  Muhammad  Sadiq  Khan,  Advocate  for 
respondents No.3 to 5. 

The parties were heard at length and even 

the  result  was  announced,  however,  while 

dictating  the  judgment,  it  is  felt  that  further 

assistance is required in the matter, especially on 

the  issue  raised  by  the  petitioner  that  after 

divorce  became  absolute  between  the  parties, 

respondent  No.3  could  not  claim  maintenance 

from  the  petitioner  in  light  of  judgment  of 

Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court 

reported  as 

‘Muhammad  Zairaf  VS  Mst.  Safia  Bibi  and  3-

others’ (2000 MLD 1900).
