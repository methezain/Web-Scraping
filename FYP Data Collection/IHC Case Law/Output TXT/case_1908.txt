MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J:- Through the instant intra 

court  appeal,  the  appellants,  Chaudhry  Mohammad  Nawaz,  and 

his  son,  Chaudhry  Muhammad  Rizwan,  impugn  the  order  dated 

08.04.2015,  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers, 

whereby 

the  appellants’  writ  petition  No.3763/2013,  was 

disposed  of  with  the  direction  to  respondent  No.1  (Federal 

Government  Employees  Housing  Foundation)  to  abide  by  their 

commitment  regarding  allotment  of  category-II  plot  to  the 

appellants on availability.  

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted  that  the 

impugned order is not in accordance with the law; that appellant 

No.1  retired  on  14.05.1996  after  attaining 

the  age  of 

superannuation; that at the time of his retirement, appellant No.1 

was  serving  as  Project  Manager  (BPS-20)  in  WAPDA;  that 

appellant  No.1  applied  to  respondent  No.1  for  the  allotment  of 

category-I  plot  (600  square  yards)  in  Phase-III  of  respondent 

No.1’s  Housing  Scheme  at  Sector  G-13,  Islamabad;  that  in  his 

application form, appellant No.1 represented that he was holding 

BPS-20  position  on  regular  basis  and  not  by  move  over;  that 

appellant No.1 submitted an affidavit deposing  therein that he or 

any  of  his  family  members  do  not  have  a  plot  or  house  in 

Islamabad;  that  on  02.09.1999,  respondent  No.1  provisionally 

offered allotment of a plot in Phase-III, Sector G-13, Islamabad to 

appellant  No.1;  that  on  22.04.2002,  appellant  No.1  was  allotted 

plot  No.34,  Street  No.49,  Sector  G-13/2,  Islamabad  measuring 

                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
2                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

500  square  yards;  that  vide  letter  dated  12.09.2006,  respondent 

No.1  called  upon  appellant  No.1  to  clear  the  outstanding  dues 

amounting  to  Rs.1,94,678/-;  that  the  said  amount  was  deposited 

by  appellant  No.1  through  pay  order  dated  12.09.2006;  that  on 

24.06.2013, appellant No.1 transferred the said plot to his son i.e. 

appellant No.2; that after a period of more than eleven years after 

the allotment of the said  plot,  respondent No.1,  vide  letter  dated 

09.09.2013,  cancelled  the  said  allotment  on  the  ground  that 

appellant No.1 was a regular BPS-19 officer on the cut off date of 

the  scheme  i.e.  01.04.1996;  that  the  transfer  of  the  said  plot  in 

favour of appellant No.2 was also cancelled by respondent No.1; 

and that aggrieved by the cancellation of the allotment of the said 

plot,  the  appellants,  on  01.10.2013,  filed  W.P.No.3763/2013 

before  this  Court;  and  that  vide  the  impugned  order  dated 

08.04.2015, the said writ petition was dismissed.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  further  submitted  that 

allotment of the said plot in the appellants’  favour was cancelled 

by  respondent  No.1  without  issuing  a  show  cause  notice  and 

without affording an opportunity of hearing to the appellants; that 

the appellants had not made any misdeclaration in the application 

form  for  the  allotment  of  a  category-I  plot;  that  respondent  No.1 

cancelled the allotment only so as to allot the plot to the petitioner 

in W.P.No.753/2012; that respondent No.1 allotted the appellants’ 

plot  to  the  petitioner  in  W.P.No.753/2012  before  cancelling  the 

allotment  from  the  appellants’  names;  and  that  respondent  No.1 

could  have  allotted  some  other  plot  to  the  petitioner  in  writ 

petition No. 753/2012 instead of cancelling the allotment from the 

appellants’ names. Learned counsel for the appellants prayed for 

the  appeal  to  be  allowed  and  for  respondent  No.1’s  impugned 

letter dated 09.09.2013 to be set aside.  

4. 

On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 

3  submitted  that  appellant  No.1  in  his  application  form  for  a 

category-I plot had misrepresented that he was a regular BPS-20 

officer;  that  in  the  verification  process,  it  was  confirmed  by 

appellant  No.1’s  employer  that  appellant  No.1’s  original  scale 

was BPS-19 and he was moved over to BPS-20; that a category-I 

 
 
3                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

plot  could  not  have  been  allotted  to  appellant  No.1;  that  it  was 

explicitly  made  clear  to  appellant  No.1  that 

in  case  the 

information furnished by him turned out to be false, the allotment 

in his favour was liable to be cancelled; that as a gesture of good 

will,  respondent  No.1  had  agreed  to  allot  a  category-II  plot  to 

appellant No.1 as and when the same became available; that  the 

plot in question has been allotted on 05.11.2013 to Umar Khan Ali 

Sherzai  on  the  orders  passed  by  this  Court  in  W.P.  No.753/2012 

titled  “Umar  Khan  Ali  Sherzai  VS  Secretary,  Ministry  of  Housing 

and Works etc.”; that in the brochure issued by respondent No.1, 

it was clearly mentioned that “for the purpose of entitlement to a 

particular category, the basic pay scale of the post and not the 

move over scale will be considered”;  and  that  since  appellant 

No.1 was a BPS-19 officer when he applied for the allotment of a 

plot, he was entitled to be allotted a plot in category-II, but not in 

category-I. Learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 prayed for 

the appeal to be dismissed.  

5. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.5  submitted  that  the 

plot in question had finally been transferred in respondent No.5’s 

favour during the pendency of the proceedings of this Court; that 

allotment letter dated 22.04.2015 had been issued in respondent 

No.5’s  favour;  and  that  respondent  No.5’s  valuable  rights  would 

be  destroyed  if  the  appellants’  appeal  was  to  succeed.  Learned 

counsel  for  respondent  No.5  prayed  for  the  appeal  to  be 

dismissed.  

6.  We  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  contesting  parties,  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their 

able assistance.  

7. 

It  is  not  disputed  that  the  brochure  issued  by  respondent 

No.1 for Phase-III of the Housing Scheme located in Sector G-13, 

Islamabad,  clearly  provided  that  “for the purpose of entitlement 

to a particular category, the basic pay scale of the post and not 

the move over scale will be considered”. This brochure contained 

the  terms  and  conditions  on  which  allotment  of  plots  could  be 

made. Category-I plots measuring 60x90 feet could be allotted to 

applicants  in  BPS-20  to  22  or  equivalent,  whereas  category-II 

 
 
4                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

plots measuring 50x90 feet could be allotted to applicants in BPS-

18 to 19 or equivalent.  

8. 

Appellant No.1’s application to respondent No.1 shows that 

he had applied for a category-I plot representing himself to be in 

BPS-20  on  regular  basis  at  the  time  of  his  retirement  on 

14.05.1996.  Certificate  dated  05.09.1996  from  the  Project 

Manager,  WAPDA  Construction  Works  Organization  (Central), 

Lahore,  shows  that  appellant  No.1  was  employed  as  Project 

Manager 

in  BPS-20  until  his  retirement.  On  02.09.1999, 

respondent  No.1  issued  a  provisional  allotment  letter  of  a 

category-I  plot  in  appellant  No.1’s  favour.  Respondent  No.1  also 

informed  appellant  No.1  that  the  cost  of  the  plot  could  be 

enhanced due  to delay  in the execution of the project caused by 

stay orders. On 22.04.2002, respondent No.1 allotted Plot No.34, 

Street  No.49,  Sector  G-13/2,  Islamabad,  to  appellant  No.1.  Vide 

letter  dated  12.09.2006,  respondent  No.1  called  upon  appellant 

No.1 to pay his outstanding dues amounting to Rs.1,94,678/-. This 

amount  was  paid  by  appellant  No.1  to  respondent  No.1  vide  pay 

order  No.1049668,  dated  14.09.2006.  The  statement  of  account 

shows that appellant No.1 paid a total of Rs.9,69,303/- for the said 

plot.  The  said  plot  was  gifted  by  appellant  No.1  to  his  son  Ch. 

Muhammad  Rizwan  (appellant  No.2).  On  24.06.2013,  respondent 

No.1 transferred the said plot in favour of appellant No.2.  

9. 

Vide 

letter  dated  04.09.2013,  WAPDA  confirmed 

to 

respondent No.1 that appellant No.1 original pay scale was BPS-

19  and  was  moved  over  to  BPS-20.  It  was  also  confirmed  that 

appellant  No.1  retired  from  service  on  14.05.1996  while  serving 

as  Superintendent  Engineer.  Vide 

letter  dated  09.09.2013, 

respondent No.1 cancelled the allotment of the said plot from the 

appellants’  names.  The  ground  taken  in  the  said  letter  dated 

09.09.2013  for  the  cancellation  of  the  allotment  was  that  in  view 

of  WPADA’s  letter  dated  04.09.2013,  it  had  been  “established” 

that  appellant  No.1  was  holding  a  regular  BPS-19  position  when 

he  applied  for  the  allotment  of  a  plot,  and  that  since  appellant 

No.1  was  not  a  regular  BPS-20  officer,  he  was  not  entitled  to  be 

allotted  a  category-I  plot.  Prior  to  cancelling  the  allotment  from 

 
 
5                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

the  appellants’  names,  respondent  No.1  had  (on  05.09.2013) 

allotted  the  said  plot  to  another  allottee  namely  Umar  Khan  Ali 

Sherzai.  

10.  Writ  petition  No.753/2012  was  instituted  by  Umar  Khan  Ali 

Sherzai against the Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Works and 

Director  General,  Federal  Government  Employees  Housing 

Foundation 

(“F.G.E.H.F."),  before 

this  Court.  Order  dated 

26.03.2012  passed  by  this  Court  shows  that  the  petitioner  in  the 

said  case  had  been  denied  allotment  of  a  plot.  Vide  order  dated 

15.10.2012,  this  Court  directed  F.G.E.H.F.  to  allot  a  plot  to  the 

petitioner  and  produce  allotment  letter  before  the  Court  on 

22.10.2012.  In  the  order  dated  22.10.2012,  this  Court  observed 

that  F.G.E.H.F.  was  bound  to  allot  an  alternative  plot  to  the 

petitioner.  On  25.10.2012,  F.G.E.H.F.  sought  reasonable  time  to 

redress  the petitioner’s  grievance.  Vide order  dated  14.06.2013, 

this  Court directed  the Director  General,  F.G.E.H.F.  to appear  in 

person  on  19.06.2013.  On  26.09.2013,  the  said  writ  petition  was 

disposed  of with  the observation  that  a plot had  been allotted  to 

the petitioner in the said case.  

11.  As  mentioned  above,  on  05.09.2013,  respondent  No.1  had 

allotted Plot No.34, Street No.49, Sector G-13/2, Islamabad, to the 

petitioner in writ petition No.753/2012. This was done even before 

cancelling  the  allotment  of  the  said  plot  from  the  appellants’ 

names.  Respondent  No.1  had 

issued  the 

letter  09.09.2013 

(cancelling  the  allotment  of  the  said  plot  from  the  appellant’s 

names),  four days  after allotting  the  said  plot to the  petitioner  in 

W.P. No.753/2012.  

12.  Respondent  No.1  before  taking  the  extreme  step  of 

cancelling  the  allotment  of  the  said  plot  from  the  appellants’ 

names  did  not  bother  to  give  an  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the 

appellants. Respondent No.1 neither issued a show cause notice 

to  the  appellants,  nor  associated  them 

in  the  process  of 

determining  whether  or  not  appellant  No.1  was  a  BPS-20  officer 

on  regular  basis  at  the  time  of  his  retirement  in  1996  or 

thereabouts.  True,  letter  dated  04.09.2013  from  WAPDA  shows 

that  appellant  No.1’s  original  scale  was  BPS-19  and  he  was 

 
 
6                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

moved  over  to  BPS-20,  when  he  retired  from  service,  but  there 

was  an  earlier  certificate  from  WAPDA  which  shows  that 

appellant  No.1  was  a  BPS-20  officer.  The  said  letter  dated 

04.09.2013  shows  that  the  same  was  issued  in-continuation  of 

letter  dated  04.07.2013,  which  letter  was  not  brought  on  record 

by  respondent  No.1.  Respondent  No.1’s  letter  in  response  to 

which the said letter dated 04.09.2013 was sent has also not been 

brought  on  record.  Respondent  No.1  should  have  exercised 

caution  and  should  have  associated  the  appellants 

in  the 

verification process before taking a drastic measure of cancelling 

the allotment of the said plot from their names.  

13.  Paragraph-8  of  the  brochure  on  which  respondent  No.1 

heavily  relies  on,  shows  that  applicants  in  BPS-18  to  19  are 

entitled  to  a  category-II  plots  which  measure  50x90  feet. 

Respondent  No.1’s  allotment  letter  dated  22.04.2002  shows  that 

he  was  allotted  Plot No.34  which measures  50x90 feet.  Although 

the said plot is said to be in category-I, respondent No.1 has not 

placed any material on record to show that the sizes of the plots 

of categories-I and II were changed.  Respondent No.1 cancelled 

the allotment more than eleven years after it was made, and that 

also after receiving the full payment  for the same from  appellant 

No.1.  Since  respondent  No.1  did  not  afford  an  opportunity  of 

hearing  to  the  appellants  prior  to  cancellation  of  the  allotment 

letter, we are of the view that this is a fit case for interference in 

the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.  

14.  A  move  over  is  simply  an  extension  in  an  employee’s  pay 

scale. It is well settled that a move over from one scale to another 

does  not  amount  to  a  promotion,  but  it  is  awarded  to  an 

incumbent after reaching the maximum of his substantive scale. A 

move  over  cannot  be  equated  with  a  promotion.  It  is  a  sort  of  a 

financial  aid  to  an  employee  who  otherwise  fulfills  all  the 

qualification for a higher grade but cannot be promoted for want 

of  a  vacancy  or  a  post.  In  the  cases  of  Muhammad  Rafique  VS 

Management  Director  (WAPDA)  (1995  SCMR  1549),  and  Tanvir 

Ahmad  VS  Chief  Secretary,  Government  of  Punjab  (2004  SCMR 

647),  it  has  been inter-alia  held  that  a  move  over  should  not  be 

 
 
7                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

considered as a promotion to a post in a higher pay scale. There 

is nothing preventing respondent No.1 to carry out a verification 

process to determine whether appellant No.1 was an employee in 

BPS-20 at WAPDA  on  the basis  of promotion or  move  over  when 

he  applied  for  the  allotment  of  a  plot.  In  this  process,  the 

appellants have a right to be associated. Respondent No.1 could 

not have carried out this process behind the appellants’ back. 

15. 

In  the  case  at  hand,  it  cannot  be  held  that  it  had  been 

“established” that appellant No.1 was not an employee in BPS-20 

at the time of his retirement or when he applied for the allotment 

of  a  plot.  This  is  more  so  when  the  certificate  dated  05.09.1996 

issued  by  Project  Manager,  WAPDA  Construction  Works 

Organization  (Central),  Lahore,  had  not  at  any  stage  been 

withdrawn.  Penalizing  the  appellants  by  cancelling  the  allotment 

of  the  said  plot,  without  affording  him  an  opportunity  of  hearing 

was  procedurally  improper  and  unreasonable.  Respondent  No.1 

may  have been  under  pressure  to  allot  a  plot to  the  petitioner in 

W.P.No.753/2012, because this Court had made a direction for an 

allotment of a plot, but that did not mean that an allotment to the 

petitioner in the said petition could be made by hastily cancelling 

the allotment from the appellants' names. Respondent No.1 could 

have  allotted 

some  other  plot 

to 

the  petitioner 

in 

W.P.No.753/2012. As observed earlier, the allotment of Plot No.34 

was  made  to  petitioner  in  W.P.No.753/2012  on  05.09.2013  i.e. 

four  days  before  cancelling  the  allotment  of  plot  No.34  from  the 

names of the appellants. This bespeaks of a sorry state of affairs 

at respondent No.1, to say the very least. Respondent No.1’s lack 

of bona fides is apparent from the fact that it has now been more 

than three years and a plot in category-II has not been allotted to 

appellant  No.1.  Appellant  No.1  is  almost  80  years  old  and 

respondent No.1 has held on to his money and also cancelled his 

plot.  

16. 

It was well settled that if there is a violation of the principles 

of natural justice, the proceedings would be rendered coram non 

judice and the order would be void. Right of personal hearing to a 

person  against  whom  an  adverse  order  is  to  be  made  has  been 

 
 
8                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

equated  with  a  fundamental  right  and  an  adverse  order  made 

without  affording  an  opportunity  of  personal  hearing  is  to  be 

treated  as  a  void  order.  If  the  principles  of  natural  justice  are 

violated  in  respect  of  any  decision,  it  is  immaterial  whether  the 

same  decision  would  have  been  arrived  at  in  the  absence  of 

departure from the essential principles of justice. Such a decision 

must  be  declared  to  be  no  decision.  In  the  case  of  Hazara  (Hill 

Tract) Improvement Trust VS Mst. Qaisra Elahi (2005 SCMR 678), 

it  has  been  held  that  violation  of  the  principle  of  audi alteram 

partem (no one should be condemned unheard) would be enough 

to vitiate even the most solemn proceedings. This principle is said 

to have its origin in the Islamic Principle of Justice. This principle 

applies to all judicial and non-judicial proceedings. Since neither 

a  show  cause  notice  was  issued  by  respondent  No.1  to  the 

appellant,  nor  were  the  appellants  afforded  an  opportunity  of  

hearing  prior  to  cancellation  of  the  allotment  of  Plot  No.34  from 

their  names,  the  decision  dated  09.09.2013,  is  liable  to  be 

declared as void and coram non judice.  

17.  At this stage, it would be appropriate to made reference to 

the following case law on the subject:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Surriya  Parveen  VS  Muzaffar  Islam  Malik 

(2007  SCMR  1202),  the  Capital  Development  Authority 

(“CDA")  had  cancelled  the  allotment  of  a  plot  from  the 

original  allottee’s  name  without  affording  him  an 

opportunity of a hearing. The same plot was then allotted 

to  another  allottee  who  had  raised  construction  thereon. 

The original allottee had made the entire payment for the 

said  plot  to  CDA.  The  cancellation  of  the  allotment  from 

the  original  allottee’s  name  was  set  aside.  The  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  in  the  said  report  observed  that  the 

subsequent  allottee  should  be  compensated  with  the 

allotment of some other plot. 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Hafiz  Muhammad  Siddique  Anwar  VS 

Faisalabad Development Authority (2007 SCMR 1126), the 

appellant  was  allotted  a plot in Faisalabad.  The  appellant 

had paid the entire consideration and had also taken over 

 
 
9                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

possession  of  the  plot.  Subsequently,  the  said  allotment 

was  cancelled.  The  Appellant’s  suit  against 

the 

cancellation of allotment was dismissed by the Civil Court 

for  want  of 

jurisdiction.  The  Hon’ble  High  Court 

maintained  the  judgment  of  the  Civil  Court.   The  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  granted  leave  to  appeal  on  the  question 

whether  the  principles  of  natural  justice  were  applicable 

to the case. The judgments of the Civil Court as well as the 

Hon'ble  High  Court  were  set  aside  and  the  matter  was 

remanded  to  the  Civil  Court  for  a  decision  afresh. 

Furthermore, it was held as follows:- 

“As in instant case admittedly opportunity of hearing was 
not granted to appellant before passing the cancellation 
order of plot from the name of appellant by the Martial 
Law functionaries, therefore, it being an order coram 
non judice was not immune from judicial review by the 
Civil Court.” 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Federal  Government  Employees’  Housing 

Foundation  VS  Muhammad  Akram  Alizai  (PLD  2002  SC 

1079), it has been held as follows:-  

“We may add that Housing Foundation while acting as' 
an official organization, has framed a policy to regulate 
its  business  as  per  its  declaration  made  in  the 
Memorandum and Articles of Association and despite 
the facts the said policy has no statutory force, still the 
organization would be bound by its policy which is being 
implemented and followed as departmental instructions 
of the controlling ministry and mandatory rule, therefore, 
the violation of said policy would be challengeable in the 
High  Court  in  its  Constitutional  jurisdiction. 
Notwithstanding any procedural defect in the allotment 
of plots to the different categories of the employees of 
Federal  Government,  the  Housing  Foundation  after 
making such allotments has no power to rescind the 
same in the light, of principle of locus poenitentiae and 
once an allotment is made and taken effect, the same 
would have legal protection and in consequence to a 
subsequent act of Housing Foundation the right of an 
allottee  is  affected,  such  allottee  can  conveniently 
invoke the Constitutional jurisdiction of High Court to 
protect  his  right  in  the  allotment.  In  nutshell,  the 
entitlement of a person for allotment of a plot in the 
scheme of Housing Foundation or a right of allotment if 
already created is undone, on any ground, the aggrieved 
person can maintain a writ petition in the High Court as 
the  remedy  of  civil  suit  in  such  cases  is  not  an 
efficacious.”

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  the  University  of  Dacca  through  its  Vice 

Chancellor VS Zakir Ahmed (PLD 1965 SC 90), it has been 

held as follows:-  

“… in all proceedings by whomsoever held, whether 
judicial or administrative, the principles of natural justice 
have to be observed if the proceedings might result in 
consequences affecting “the person or property or other 
right of the parties concerned.” This rule applies even 
though there may be no positive words in the statute or 
legal document; whereby the power is vested to take 
such proceedings, for, in such cases this requirement is 
to be implied into it as the minimum requirement of 
fairness.” 
(Emphasis added) 

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Younus  Ahmed  Zai  VS 

Executive  Officer,  Malir  Cantonment  (2017  MLD  1094), 

after the allottee had made the entire payment for the plot 

in  question, 

the  allotment  was  cancelled  by 

the 

respondent. Neither was the allottee issued a show cause 

notice,  nor  was  he  afforded  an  opportunity  of  hearing 

before  the impugned  action was  taken.  The  Hon’ble High 

Court  set  the  cancellation  of  the  allotment  aside  on  the 

ground that action was taken in violation of the principles 

of natural justice.  

(vi) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Ayub  VS  Azad  Government  of 

the  State  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (2016  YLR  45),  plots 

were  allotted  by  the Mirpur  Development Authority  to  the 

allottees  after  receiving  payment  from  them.  These 

allotments  were  cancelled  by  the  Government  without 

affording  an  opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  allottees.  The 

Hon'ble High Court of Azad Jammu and Kashmir set aside 

the  orders  cancelling 

the  allotments  of  plots. 

In 

paragraph-14 of the said report, it was inter-alia observed 

that  the  allotments  of  plots  were  cancelled  in  violation  of 

the  principles  of  natural  justice,  as  neither  were  show 

cause  notices  issued  to  the  allottees,  nor  were  they 

afforded an opportunity of hearing. 

(vii) 

In  the  case  of  Pakistan  Medical  Cooperative  Society  VS 

Azra  Latif  (2012  CLC  662),  the  appellant’s  case  was  that 

the respondent’s membership and provisional allotment of 

 
 
 
 
 
11                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

plot  were  cancelled  because  she  had  failed  to  clear  her 

dues,  and  the  cancellation  of  allotment  was  approved  in 

the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  the  Society/appellant. 

Since  the  appellant  had  cancelled  the  allotment  without 

affording  an  opportunity  of  a  hearing  to  the  respondent, 

the cancellation of the allotment was set aside. It was held 

that the cancellation of the allotment “was an act  against 

the golden principle of audi alteram partem”.  

(viii)  In  the  case  of  Jamal  Nasir  VS  Karachi  Development 

Authority (2004 CLC 15), an allotment of a plot in favour of 

an allottee was cancelled on the ground that the allotment 

was  made  in  violation  of  the  Rules  and  Regulations.  The 

Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh  set 

aside  the  cancellation  of  the  allotment  inter-alia  on  the 

ground  that  no  prior  notice  had  been  issued  by  the 

respondent authority to the allottee.   

(ix) 

In the case of Muhammad Talib VS Karachi Development 

Authority  (1999  CLC  813),  an  allotment  of  a  plot  made  in 

the  petitioner’s  favour  was  cancelled  by  the  Karachi 

Development  Authority  without  issuing  the  petitioner  a 

show cause notice. The cancellation of the allotment was 

said  to  have  been  made  on  the  directions  of  the  Prime 

Minister.  The  Division  Bench  of the Hon'ble  High  Court  of 

Sindh  allowed  the  petitioner’s  writ  petition  and  set  aside 

the  order  of  cancellation  of 

the  allotment  of  the 

petitioner’s  plot.  It  was  inter-alia  held  that  the  order  of 

cancellation  of  the  allotment  was  passed  ignoring  the 

established judicial norms.  

(x) 

In  the  case  of  Yaqub  Eusuf  Mayet  VS  Pakistan  Defense 

Officers’  Housing  Authority 

(1992  CLC  1444), 

the 

petitioner had purchased a plot from the original allottee, 

and  the  transfer  was  approved  by  the  respondent 

authority.  Subsequently, 

the 

respondent  authority 

cancelled the allotment of the plot without issuing a show 

cause  notice  to  the  petitioner  and  without  hearing  the 

petitioner. The Division Bench of the Hon'ble High Court of 

 
 
12                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

Sindh  set  aside  the  cancellation  of  the  allotment  on  the 

ground before taking an  action to cancel the allotment  of 

a  plot,  no  prior  show  cause  notice  was  issued  and  no 

hearing  was  granted 

to 

the  petitioner/allottee. 

Furthermore, it was held as follows:- 

“if any action is proposed to be taken by the respondent 
authority against the petitioner in respect of the plot, a 
prior  show  cause  notice  giving  full  facts  and  the 
grounds, on which cancellation is intended, shall be 
given and thereafter full opportunity will be granted to 
the petitioner to place his case before the Defence 
Authority and only after fulfilling such formalities, action 
shall be taken by the respondent authority” 

(xi) 

In  the  case  of  Jamal  Shah  VS  Azad  Government  of  the 

State  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  (1991  MLD  1243),  the 

allotment  of  a  plot  was  cancelled  without  affording  an 

opportunity of a hearing to the allottee. The cancelled plot 

was subsequently allotted to another allottee. The Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of Azad and Jammu Kashmir set aside the 

cancellation of  the  allotment inter-alia  the ground  that  no 

show cause notice was issued to the original allottee and 

therefore  the  doctrine  of  audi alteram partem had  been 

violated.  

(xii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Iqbal  Shaikh  VS  Karachi 

Development Authority (1990 CLC 879), the petitioner had 

challenged  an  order  directing  him 

to  hand  over 

possession  of  an  industrial  plot.  The  petitioner  had  been 

allotted  the  said  plot  for  which  he  had  made  the  entire 

payment.  The  Division  Bench  of  Hon'ble  High  Court  of 

Sindh, without going into the merits of the case, set aside 

the impugned order on the ground that the petitioner had 

not  been  given  an  opportunity  of  hearing  before  an 

adverse order regarding the plot had been passed against 

him.  Both  the  Hon'ble  Judges  on  the  said  Bench  rose  to 

grace  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan.  Therefore 

this judgment is to be revered and respected. 

(xiii)  In  the  case  of  Noor  Muhammad  Shah  VS  Chairman, 

Karachi  Development  Authority  (1989  CLC  1470),  the 

Karachi  Development  Authority  had  cancelled 

the 

 
 
 
 
13                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

petitioner’s  residential  plot  on  the  ground  that  there  was 

no  specific  order  of  the  competent  authority  for  the 

allotment of plot. The petitioner’s writ petition against the 

cancellation of the allotment was set aside by the Division 

Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh  on  the  ground 

that  the  cancellation  of  the  allotment  was  made 

in 

violation  of  the  principles  of  natural  justice (audi alteram 

partem).  Furthermore,  a  direction  was  given  to  the 

Karachi Development Authority to grant an opportunity of 

hearing to the petitioner after taking his submissions into 

consideration.  

(xiv)  In the case of Karachi Development Authority VS Dawood 

(1984  CLC  2080),  the  Karachi  Development  Authority 

cancelled  the  allotment  of  an  industrial  plot,  after  the 

allottee  had  paid  for  the  plot  and  after  taking  over 

possession of the same.  The  Hon'ble  High Court  of Sindh 

set aside the cancellation of the plot. In the said report, it 

was inter-alia  observed  that  the  action  of  cancellation  of 

the  allotment  could  not  be  sustained  as  the  same  was 

against the principles of natural justice.  

(xv) 

In  the  case  of  Yar  Muhammad  v.  K.D.A.  (P  L  D  1976 

Karachi 830), it has been observed as follows:-  

“The  mere  fact  that  an  allotment  order  could  be 
cancelled without giving reason does not abrogate the 
rule of natural justice that the aggrieved party has to be 
heard before an order affecting his right is passed. The 
allotment order issued in favour of the petitioner's father 
conferred an important right upon him. In fact the reason 
given by respondent No. 1, in its letter, dated 17th 
October, 1973, for cancelling the allotment in favour of 
petitioner's father was that the old allotment order in 
favour of Hidayatullah had been cancelled without notice 
to him.” 

(xvi)  In  the  case  of  Noor  Muhammad  VS  K.D.A.  (PLD  1975 

Karachi 373), it has been held as follows:-  

“Paragraph  19  of  the  application  form  specifically 
provides that in case of breach of any of the conditions 
stated in the application form, the K.D.A. would have the 
right, by notice in writing, to cancel the allotment. This, 
however, does not mean that the K.D.A. or the Chairman 
would act in an arbitrary, discriminating or in a capri-
cious manner or that the allottee was not to be given a 
fair opportunity of representing his case or that any 

 
 
 
 
 
14                                                  I.C.A.No.188/2015 

representation or cause shown by him was not to be 
examined or taken into consideration.” 

18. 

In view of the law laid down by the Superior Courts in the 

judgments  mentioned  above,  and  since  respondent  No.1’s 

action  of  cancelling  the  allotment  of  Plot  No.34  from  the 

appellants'  name  was  in  violation  of  the  principles  of  natural 

justice,  the 

letter  dated  09.09.2013 

is  declared  as  void. 

Respondent No.1’s remain liable to allot an alternate plot to the 

petitioner  in  W.P.No.753/2012  or  to  person  whose  rights  flow 

from  the  said  petitioner.  This  appeal  is  allowed  and  the 

impugned  order  dated  08.04.2015  is  set-aside.  Consequently, 

the appellants’ writ petition No.3763/2013 is allowed.
