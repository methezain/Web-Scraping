Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

                              22.02.2022.  Mr.  Muhammad  Saeed  Khan  Niazi,  Advocate 

for Petitioners. 
Mr. Tufail Shahzad, Advocate for Respondents.  

Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  states 

that  both  the  learned  Courts  below  have  only 

considered the financial status of the father in 

violation of the latest judgments of the Honâ€™ble 

Supreme  Court.  The 

learned  counsel  has 

further  submitted  that  financial  strength  of 

Respondent  No.  3/father  is  visible  from  the 

amounts paid by him as interim maintenance. 

In 

this  regard, 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

Petitioner  has  drawn  attention  of  this  Court 

towards the diary sheets available on page Nos. 

58 to 67 which show the detail of the amounts 

paid  by  Respondent  No.  3  to  the  Petitioners. 

However,  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unable  to  explain  why  different  amounts  were 

being  paid  by  the  father/Respondent  No.  3, 

each time.  

2.  As  per  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner 

the  varying  amount  represent  arrears  of  the 

interim maintenance. However, he is unable to 

point out the order by way of which the interim 

maintenance  was  fixed,  therefore,  it  cannot  be 

ascertained  whether  such  amounts  represent 

arrears  or  not.    Learned  counsel  for  Petitioner 

is  directed  to  come  better  prepared  to  assist 

this Court so that precious time of the Court is 

not wasted.  

3.  Relist.
