SAMAN RAFA T IMTIAZ,  J.  Through  the  instant  judgment,  I  propose  to 

decide  the  two  above  titled  Civil  Revision  Petitions  and  the  Writ  Petition  as 

they  involve  the  same  parties  and  similar  questions  of law and  fact. 

Case History 

2. 

In  C.R.  No.53/2016,  the  Petitioner  [Ch.  Din  Muhammad]  has  assailed 

the  Order  dated  09.12.2014  ("Impugned  Order  I")  passed  by  the  learned 

Civil  Judge  151  Class  (East)  Islamabad  ("Trial  Court"),  whereby  Petitioner's 

application  under  Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  was  dismissed.  The  Petitioner 

has  also  assailed  the  Judgment  dated  09.03.2015  ("Impugned  Judgment 

2 

C.R  No.5312016,  C.R  No.162/2016  & W.P  No.2864/2015. 

II")  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (East),  Islamabad 

("Appellate  Court")  whereby  appeal  filed  by  the  Petitioner  against  the 

Impugned Order I  of the learned Trial Court was allowed but the matter was 

remanded  to  the  learned  Trial  Court  with  direction  to  frame  issue,  record 

evidence and decide the application under Order IX, Rule  13, C.P.C., afresh. 

The  Petitioner  has  prayed  that  the  instant  Revision  petition  may  kindly  be 

accepted  and the  Impugned  Order I  and Impugned  Judgment  II  be set aside 

and  that  the  application  under  Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  filed  by  the 

Petitioner be accepted unconditionally in the interest of justice. 

3. 

In  C.R.  No.152/2015,  the  Petitioners  [Javed  Iqbal  Saif  and  Ch. 

Muzammal  Hussain]  have  assailed  the  Impugned  Judgment  II  dated 

09.03.2015 passed  by the  learned Appellate  Court, whereby  appeal filed by 

Respondent No.2  [Ch. Din Muhammad] against the Impugned Order I  dated 

09.12.2014 oflearned Trial Court was allowed and the matter was remanded 

to  decide  his  application  under  Order  IX  Rule  13  C.P.C.,  afresh  after 

framing of issue and recording of evidence. The Petitioners  have prayed that 

this Revision petition  may kindly be accepted and Impugned Judgment II  be 

set aside to meet the ends of justice. 

4. 

Through  the  Writ  Petition  No.2864/2015,  the  Petitioner  [Ch.  Din 

Muhammad] has assailed the Impugned Order I  dated 09.12.2014 passed by 

the  learned  Trial  Court,  whereby  the  Petitioner's  application  under  Section 

12(2), C.P.C., was  dismissed. The Petitioner  has also assailed the Judgment 

dated 09.03.2015  ("Impugned  Judgment  111"), whereby  Revision  Petition 

filed  by  the  Petitioner  against  the  Impugned  Order  I  to  the  extent  of the 

Petitioner's  application under Section 12(2) C.P.C.,  was dismissed. 

Facts 

5. 

Brief  facts  are  that  on  22.05.2010,  Javed  Iqbal  Saif  and  Ch. 

Muzammal  Hussain  (Respondents  No.1  &  2  in  C.R  No.53/2016  &  W.P 

No.2664/2015)  filed  a  Suit  for  Specific  Performance  and  Permanent 

Injunction  against  Ch.  Din  Muhammad  (Petitioner  in  C.R  No.53/2016  & 

W.P. 2864/2015)  (herein  after referred  to  as the  "Petitioner")  alleging that 

Javed Iqbal  Saif and Ch. Muzammal Hussain (herein after referred to as the 

"Respondents  No.1  &  2"),  in  the  presence  of witnesses,  entered  into  an 

agreement  dated  10.06.2008  ("Agreement")  with  the  Petitioner,  who  is 

3 

C.R  No.5312016,  C.R  No.16212016  & W.P  No.2864/2015. 

owner  of suit  plot  No.506,  situated  at  PWD  Housing  Society  ("Society"), 

Korang  Town,  Islamabad  ("Suit  Plot").  That  according  to  the  Agreement 

the Petitioner received an amount of Rs.300,000/- from the Respondent No.1 

and  Rs.450,000/-  from  the  Respondent  No.2  as  sale  consideration  between 

2004  and  2008.  According  to  the  Agreement,  the  Petitioner  was  strictly 

liable  to  hand  over  the  title  documents  of  the  Suit  Plot  along  with 

membership  of the  Society.  Further,  that when  the  Respondents  No. I  &  2 

contacted  the  Petitioner  for completion  of his part  of the  obligations  under 

the said Agreement,  he flatly refused and delayed the matter  on one pretext 

or the other. 

6. 

After  filing  of  the  Suit,  despite  issuance  of  summons/notice  and 

proclamation,  the  Petitioner  did  not  tum  up  therefore  the  matter proceeded 

against  him  ex-parte  on  I9.07.20IO.  After  recording  of ex-parte  evidence, 

suit  of the  Respondents  No. I  &  2  was  decreed  vide  ex-parte  Judgment  & 

Decree dated  11.01.2012 ("Ex-Parte  Judgment  & Decree"). 

7. 

Thereafter the Respondents No. I  & 2  filed Execution Petition. During 

the  execution  proceedings,  the  Petitioner  filed  applications  under  Section 

12(2), C.P.C.,  and  Order  IX,  Rule  I3,  C.P.C.  Subsequently,  however,  the 

Petitioner  sought withdrawal  of the said applications with permission to file 

afresh  and  thereafter  filed  another  application  under  Section  12(2), C.P.C. 

However,  both  applications  were  dismissed  as  withdrawn  by  the  learned 

Trial  Court  without  permission  to  file  afresh  vide  Order  dated  23.09.2013. 

The  Petitioner  filed  an  appeal  against  such  order,  which  was  allowed  vide 

judgment  dated  27.I1.2013  whereby the  applications  under  Order IX, Rule 

I3,  C.P.C.,  and  under  Section  I2(2)  C.P.C.,  were  held  deemed  to  be 

pending. 

8.  After  hearing  the  arguments,  the  learned  Trial  Court  dismissed  the 

Petitioner's  applications  under  Section  12(2) C.P.C., as well as under Order 

IX, Rule  I3,  C.P.C.,  vide  the Impugned  Order  I.  The  Petitioner,  therefore, 

filed  an  appeal  wherein  the  learned  Appellate  Court  vide  Impugned 

Judgment II set aside the Impugned Order I  to the extent  of the Petitioner's 

application  under  Order  IX, Rule  I3,  C.P.C., with  direction  to  frame  issue, 

record evidence and decide afresh. Whereas against dismissal of application 

under  Section  I2(2)  C.P.C.,  the  Petitioner  filed  Civil  Revision  Petition 

before the  Appellate  Court,  which was  dismissed  vide  Impugned  Judgment

C.R No.5312016, C.R No.162/2016 & W.P No.286412015. 

III. 

Arguments 

9. 

The learned counsel for the Petitioner with regard to application under 

Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  inter alia,  contended  that  Impugned  Order  I  of 

the  learned Trial  Court  and Impugned Judgment II of the  learned Appellate 

Court  are  very  harsh  and  against  the  spirit  of natural justice;  that  both the 

Courts  below  did not  apply their judicial  mind while passing  the Impugned 

Order  I  and  Impugned  Judgment  II;  that  Impugned  Order  I  and  Impugned 

Judgment II have resulted  in miscarriage of justice;  that the Petitioner never 

received any summons through his son and that he has no son named Hamza 

who allegedly received the summons; that learned Trial Court while passing 

the  order  for  substituted  service  did  not  follow  the  relevant  provisions  of 

C.P.C.  Learned  counsel  with  regard  to  the  application  under  Section  12(2) 

C.P.C.,  inter alia,  contended that the  Impugned Judgment  III  is  a nullity  in 

the  eyes  of the  law  as  the  Ex-parte  Judgment  and  Decree  passed  by  the 

learned  Civil  Judge  (West)  Islamabad  was  coram  non  Judice;  that 

Respondents  No.1  &  2  were  fully  aware  of the  fact  that  the  suit  plot  is 

situated within the territorial jurisdiction  of the East Division  and the matter 

could only be adjudicated  by the learned Civil Judge East; that the Ex-Parte 

Judgment  &  Decree  was  obtained  by  the  Respondents  No.1  &  2  through 

fraud  and  misrepresentation;  that  the  learned  Trial  Court  as  well  as  the 

learned Appellate  Court  failed to  follow the  law and  dictums  laid down by 

the  superior  Courts;  that  both  the  Courts  below  have  exercised  illegal 

jurisdiction  and  committed  material irregularities. He relied  on Mst. Zahran 

Bibi  VS  Ghulam Qadir, 2022 MLD 250. 

10.  The  learned  counsel  for the  Respondents  No. l  &  2  has  controverted 

the  arguments  of advanced  in  C.R No.53/2016  and  W.P No.2864/2015.  In 

C.R No.152/2016  by the  learned counsel  for the  Petitioner.  He  contended 

that the Impugned  Judgment II of the  learned Appellate  Court is against the 

law and facts of the case; that the learned Appellate Court while deciding the 

appeal entirely ignored the facts recorded by learned Trial Court in its order 

sheet;  that  the  learned  Appellate  Court  acted  in  exercise  of  illegal 

jurisdiction  and  committed  material  irregularities;  and  that  Impugned 

5 

C.R  No.5312016,  C.R  No.16212016  & W.P  No.2864/2015. 

Judgment  II  has  been  passed  by  the  learned  Appellate  Court  without 

applying judicial  mind. 

11. 

I  have  heard  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  perused  the  record 

with the able assistance of learned counsel for the parties. 

C.R No.53/2016 and C.R No.152/2015 

12. 

In  a  nutshell  the  Petitioner  in  C.R.  No.53/2016  has  prayed  for  the 

unconditional acceptance of his application under Order IX, Rule  13, C.P.C., 

whereas the Respondents No.  1  and 2 have prayed for the dismissal thereof. 

13.  The  learned  counsel  for the  Respondents  No.  1  and  2  argued that  as 

per  the  Petitioner's  own  admission  in  his  first  application  under  Section 

12(2),  C.P.C.,  he  came  to  know  of  the  Ex-parte  Judgment  &  Decree  on 

19.03.2013, therefore,  any subsequent application under  Order IX, Rule  13, 

C.P.C.,  was  time  barred.  First  of  all,  the  record  does  not  contain  any 

subsequent application  under Order IX, Rule  13,  C.P.C.  Secondly, this line 

of argument does not take into account Order dated 27.11.2013, whereby the 

Order dated 23.09.2013  allowing the Petitioner to  withdraw  the Petitioner's 

applications  under  Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  and  under  Section  12(2), 

C.P.C.,  without  permission  to  file  afresh  was  set  aside  and  the  Petitioner's 

applications  under  Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  and  under  Section  12(2), 

C.P.C., were  deemed  pending. There  is  nothing on record  to  show that  said 

Order dated 27.11.2013 was challenged in which case it has attained finality. 

Even otherwise, the said order has not been assailed before this Court in the 

instant proceedings. 

14.  Next the  learned counsel for the Respondents No.  1  and 2  argued that 

the  record  reflects 

that  the  Petitioner's  son  received  summons  on 

07.06.2010,  thereafter,  service  was  made  by  way  of  publication  on 

19.07.2010 and  as  such  the  Ex-parte  Impugned  Judgment  and  Decree  was 

passed  after  following the proper  course of action.  Therefore,  according to 

the learned counsel  for the Respondents No.  1  and 2, the learned Trial Court 

correctly  dismissed  the  Petitioner's  application  under  Order  IX,  Rule  13, 

C.P.C.,  and  the  Impugned  Judgment  II  passed  by  the  learned  Appellate 

Court is liable to be dismissed. 

6 

C.R  No.53'2016,  C.R  No.162'2016  & W.P  No.2864'2015. 

15.  On  the  other  hand,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  drew  the 

attention  of this  Court  to  the  fact  that  the  service  report  dated  07.06.2010 

purportedly showing receipt of summons by one named Hamza allegedly the 

son of the Petitioner  does  not contain any name  or ID  of the  recipient. The 

Petitioner has denied that he has any son named Hamza. Moreover, the diary 

sheet dated  18.06.2010 states that summons were "un-served"  yet substituted 

service was allowed to be made by way of publication. He, therefore, argued 

that  substitute  service under  such circumstances  by way  of publication  was 

not  warranted  and  was  not  in  accordance  with  Order  V,  Rules  19  and  20, 

C.P.C.,  which  allows  publication  only  in the  event  of refusal  of service by 

the defendant. 

16.  Examination of the relevant provisions of Order V, C.P.C., shows that 

under Rule  15  thereof,  where the defendant cannot be found, the  scheme of 

law allows service  to be made on an adult male member  of the defendant's 

family  who  is  residing  with  him.  However,  in  the  instant  case  there  is 

nothing  on  record  to  show  that  the  defendant  could  not  be  found  as  the 

process  server's  report  dated  07-06-2010  simply  states  that  upon  inquiring 

about the Petitioner,  the process  server met the Petitioner's  son.  Moreover, 

there  is  also nothing  on the  record to  controvert the  Petitioner's  denial that 

he  does  not  have  a  son  named  Hamza  nor  that  the  person  who  allegedly 

received the summons at the Petitioner's  house was an adult. 

1 7. 

In  this  regard  I  would  like  to  quote  the  following  passage  from  the 

case of Yaqoob Ali  VS  Muhammad Ayub, PLD 2021Lahore678: 

17.  Order  V  "CP.C"  relates  to  issue  and  service  of  summons.  Ex-parte 
proceedings  were  ordered  against  the  "respondents"  while  resorting  to  the 
mode  of substituted  service  through  publication  in  newspaper.  Order  V Rule 
20  "CP.C"  prescribes  the  mode  of substituted  service,  which  is  reproduced 
below for  ready  reference  and convenience:- 

"20.  Substituted  service. ---(1) Where the  Court  is satisfied  that  there  is 
reason  to  believe  that  the  defendant  is  keeping  out  of the  way for  the 
purpose  of avoiding  service,  or  that for  any  other  reason  the summons 
cannot  be served  in the ordinary  way,  the  Court  shall  order for  service 
of the summons  by- 

(a)  affixing  a  copy  of  the  summons  at  some  conspicuous  part  of  the 
house,  if any,  in  which  the  defendant  is  known  to  have  last  resided  or 
carried  on business  or personally  worked for  gain;  or 

(b)  any  electronic  device  of  communication  which  may 

include 

7 

C.R  No.53/2016,  C.R  No.162/2016  & W.P  No.286412015. 

telegram,  telephone, phonogram,  telex, fax,  radio  and television;  or 

(c)  urgent  mail  service  or public  courier  services;  or  (d)  beat  of drum 
in the locality  where  the defendant  resides;  or 

(e)  publication 
think fit; 

in press;  or  (!)  any  other  manner  or  mode  as  it  may 

Provided  that  the  Court  may  order  the  use  of all  or  any  of the 

aforesaid  manners  and modes  of service  simultaneously. 

Effect  of substituted  service. -- (2) Service  substituted  by order  of 
the  Court  shall  be  as  effectual  as  if it had  been  made  on  the  defendant 
personally. 

Where service  substituted  time for  appearance  to  be fixed.--  (3) 
Where  service  is  substituted  by  order  of the  Court,  the  Court  shall fix 
such  time for  the  appearance  of the  defendant  as  the  case  may  require 
which  shall  not ordinarily  exceed fifteen days. " 

Though  Rule  20  provides  the  mechanism  of  substituted  service  but  before 
resorting  to  said  provision  of  law  it  is  incumbent  upon  the  Court  to  ensure 
the  compliance  of Rules  16, 18 and  19 of Order ibid. 

18. 
In  terms  of Rule 16  it  is  obligatory for  a serving  officer  who  delivers 
or tenders  a copy  of the  summons  to the  defendant  personally,  or to an  agent 
or  other  person  on  his  behalf,  that  he  shall  require  the  signature  of  the 
person  to  whom  the  copy  is  so  delivered  or  tendered  to  an  acknowledgment 
of  service  endorsed  on  the  original  summons.  Rule  18 further  directs  the 
manner  of  service  in  which  the  same  is  served,  to  mention  the  name  and 
address  of the person  (if any)  and  identify  the person  served  and  witnesses  of 
the  delivery  or  tender  of  the  summons.  Rule  19 further  goes  on  to  lay  down 
the procedure  for  the  Court  that  where  a  summon  is  returned  under  Rule  17 
aforesaid  duly  verified,  the serving  officer  shall  be  examined  on  oath  and may 
make such  inquiry  in the matter  as  it thinks fit  and shall  either  declare  that  the 
summons  is  duly  served  or  as  it  thinks  fit  and  after  his full  satisfaction  to 
proceed  further.  The provisions  mentioned  hereinabove  are not illusory  but  it 
is  bounden  duty  of  the  Court  to  make  substantial  compliance  of  the  same 
in  terms  of  Order  V  Rule  20 
before  directing 
"C.P.C. ".  The  Court  for  the  said  purpose  has  to  satisfy  itself  that  all  the 
efforts  to  effect service  in  the  ordinary  mode  have failed.  Non-adherence 
to 
the  mandatory  provisions  would  render  the  process  invalid  and  the  edifice 
built  thereon  would  automatically  fall  down.  Reliance  in  this  respect  can  be 
placed on Mrs.  Nargis  Latifv.  Mrs.  Feroz Afaq  Ahmed  Khan  (2001 SCMR  99), 
Mubarak  Ali  v.  First  Prudential  Modaraba  (2009  CLD  849),  Haji  Akbar  and 
others  v.  Gui  Baran  and  7  others  (1996  SCMR  1703)  and  Fazal  Hussain  v. 
Mst.  Husna  Bano  (1995 MLD  170). "  [Emphasis  added]. 

the  substituted  service 

18. 

Similarly 

in 

the  case  of  Islah-ud-Din  Chaudhry  VS  Sardar 

Muhammad  Naseem  Abbasi,  PLD  2017  Islamabad  356,  this  Court  held  as 

follows: 

"14. 
... Under Order  V,  Rule  17 C.P. C.,  it is  only when the defendant refuses to 
accept  service  or  where  the  defendant  cannot  be found  despite  all  due  and 
reasonable  diligence  to find  the  defendant  service  that  the  Process  Server  can 
affix  a  copy  of the  summons  on  the  outer  door  or  some  conspicuous part  of the 
house  in  which  the  defendant  ordinarily  resides  or  carries  on  business.  For  the 
Process  Server  to  serve  the  summons  on  the  defendant  through  affixation 
pursuant  to  Order  V,  Rule  17  C.P.C.,  an  order  of  Court  to  that  effect  is  not 
necessary.  Jn  the  case  at  hand,  the  learned  Trial  Court  had  ordered for  the 
summons  to  be  affixed  at  the  appellant's  address  given  in  the  plaint  by  the 

8 

C.R  No.5312016,  C.R  No.162/2016  & W.P  No.286412015. 

respondent. Such an order is passed  by the Court under Order  V.  Rule 20 (1)  (a) 
C.P.C.,  which is reproduced herein below:-- 

"20 .... 

15. 
Affixing  the summons at the house of the defendant  is one of the forms  of 
substituted service under Order V.  Rule 20 C. P. C.  Such substituted service cannot 
be  ordered  unless  the  Court  is  satisfied  that  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the 
defendant is keeping out of the way for the purpose  of avoiding service or for any 
other reason the summons cannot be served  in the ordinary way.  It is well settled 
that personal  service is a rule and substituted  service is an  exception  which may 
he  resorted  to  in  unusual  circumstances.  Law  primarily  requires  personal 
service to he tile best mode of bringing  notice to tile knowledge  of the defendant. 
In  tile  case  at  hand,  tile  order  sheet  as  well  as  tile  impugned  judgment  and 
decree do not reveal tile satisfaction  of tile learned  Trial Court to tile effect  that 
there  was reason  to  believe  that  tile  appellants  were keeping  away  in  order  to 
avoid  service  or  that  there  was  reason  to  believe  that  summons  could  not  be 
served  in  tile  ordinary  way,  before  substituted  service  was  resorted  to. " 
[Emphasis  added]. 

19.  Applying the said principles to the instant case, it appears that the pre- 

requisites  of  substitute  service  were  not  met. 

It  is  reiterated  that  the 

circumstances  in  which  service  may  be  made  on  an  adult  male  member  of 

defendant's  family who is residing with him were not met as there is nothing 

to  establish  that  the  defendant  could  not  be  found.  Moreover,  the  service 

report dated 07.06.2010 does not contain the signature of the alleged Hamza 

who  received  the  summons/notices.  The  Order  dated  18.06.2010 records 

that  summons  were  returned  "un-served",  which  indicates  that  service 

allegedly made on Hamza was not held good service upon the Petitioner.  It 

does not  state that  the Petitioner  was refusing to  accept  service or avoiding 

it.  Yet  the  said  order  directed  service  to  be  made  by  publication  without 

recording any circumstances justifying  substitute service. 

20. 

It  appears  that  the  learned  Appellate  Court,  vide  the  Impugned 

Judgment  II,  has  remanded  the  matter  to  the  learned  Trial  Court  with 

direction  to  frame  issue,  record  evidence  and  decide  the  application  under 

Order IX, Rule  13,  C.P.C., afresh to resolve the controversy as to whether or 

not  the  Petitioner  has  a  son named  Hamza.  However,  as  discussed  herein 

above, even if the Petitioner has a son named Hamza who was an adult at the 

relevant  time,  it  would  not  make  the  service  in  accordance  with  Order  V, 

Rule  15,  C.P.C.,  as  nothing on the record  suggests that  the Petitioner  could 

not be found. As such, in my opinion, summons were not duly served and no 

9 

C.R No.53'2016, C.R No.16212016 & W.P No.2864'2015. 

fruitful purpose will be served by remanding the matter to the Trial Court as 

directed by the Appellate  Court vide the Impugned Judgment  II.  The afore  

stated  reasons  are  sufficient  grounds  for  interference  in  revision.  The 

Petitioner  has  made  out  a  case  for allowing  of his  application  under Order 

IX, Rule  13, C.P.C. 

Writ Petition No.2864/2015 

21. 

In  the  instant  Petition,  the  Petitioner  prayed  for  setting  aside  of 

Impugned  Order  I  dated  09.12.2014  and  Impugned  Judgment  III  dated 

09.03.2015  and  for  the  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.,  to  be 

accepted. 

22.  The  learned  Trial  Court vide the  Impugned  Order  I  observed that the 

Petitioner  filed  the  application  under  Section  12(2), C.P.C.,  mainly  on  the 

ground  that  there  is no  Agreement  between  the  parties  for  sale of plot  and 

that there  is only  a  statement  written  by one  of the  witnesses  in which two 

sentences  have  been  added  by  forgery  and  cheating,  hence  fraud  has  been 

played upon the Court. The Petitioner  failed to point out any non-reading or 

misreading  on  the  part  of the  learned  Trial  Court  in  this  regard.  Indeed,  a 

bare  perusal  of  the  Petitioner's  application  under  Section  12(2),  C.P.C., 

reveals  that  no  ground  was  agitated  other  than  allegations  of  fraud  and 

cheating  with  regard  to  the  alleged  sale  agreement  for  which  speci fie 

performance  was  sought  by  the  Respondents  No. 

1  and  2.  In  such 

circumstances,  the  learned  Trial  Court  rightly  concluded  that  the  Petitioner 

has  not  challenged  the  validity  of the  Ex-parte  Judgment  &  Decree  on the 

plea  of fraud, misrepresentation  or want  of jurisdiction  as allegations of the 

agreement  in question  being  based on  fraud and cheating  do not  fall within 

the ambit of the provision of Section 12(2), C.P.C. 

23.  The  learned  Appellate  Court elaborated vide the  Impugned Judgment 

III  that  fraud  and  misrepresentation  under  Section  12(2), C.P.C.,  must  be 

committed  by the  party  with  the  Court  or during  the  proceedings  in Court. 

Whereas the Petitioner has not alleged any fraud or misrepresentation played 

upon the Court. 

24. 

I  fully agree with the concurrent  findings and conclusions  reached by 

both the Courts below.  It is  a matter of settled law that provision of Section 

10 

C.R No.53/2016, C.R No.16212016 & W.P No.2864/2015. 

12(2), C.P.C.,  would  be  attracted  only when  fraud and  misrepresentation  is 

alleged  in connection  with the proceedings of the Court  and not prior to the 

initiation of proceedings  in Court. Reliance is placed on Miss. Shazia Ashraf 

VS  Municipal  Committee,  Sahiwal  through Administrator,  2006  CLC  1018 

and Muhammad  Younus VS  Venue Guards Advani,  2015  CLD  390. In  this 

case, the  Petitioner  failed to highlight  any act of fraud  or misrepresentation 

on the part  of the  Respondents  No.  I  and 2  that was  allegedly  played upon 

the Court  and the  all the  allegations regarding  fraud and  cheating pertained 

to instances prior to the institution of proceedings in Court. 

25.  Coming to the allegation regarding lack of territorial jurisdiction,  it is 

firstly noted that no  such plea was taken by the Petitioner  in his application 

under  Section  12(2),  C.P.C.  Under  Section  21,  C.P.C.,  the  objection 

regarding  jurisdiction  is  to  be  taken  in  the  Court  of  first  instance  at  the 

earliest  possible  opportunity.  Even  otherwise,  the  question  of jurisdiction 

has been ably dealt with by the learned Appellate Court as follows: 

"The  counsel  for  appellant  has  mainly  emphasized  that  the  matter  in  hand 
pertains  to  District  Division  East,  Islamabad  and  the  ex-parte judgment  and 
decree  was passed  by  learned  Civil  Judge  West,  Islamabad.  Thus  the  ex-parte 
judgment  and decree is void being without jurisdiction  and whole series of orders 
passed  thereafter  together  with  super  structure  of rights  and  obligations  of the 
parties  built upon them would/all  to the ground. 

The pivotal  question for  this  Court  is  to  be  determined  whether  the  ex  
parte judgment  and  decree  in  question  were passed  by  the  Court  without  being 
clothed with territorial jurisdiction.  To recapitulate it may be noted that by virtue 
of  Notification  14(1)  Admin/2011  dated  24.05.2011,  the  Chief  Commissioner 
Islamabad  Capital  Territory divided the area of Islamabad  Capital  Territory into 
two Districts and Sessions Divisions i.e.  Islamabad  West and Islamabad East. But 
till  2810212012,  there  were  no  separate  Civil  Court  of East  Division.  The  Civil 
Judge  Islamabad  was  vested  with  the  territorial jurisdiction  regarding  the  both 
the said divisions.  Thereafter, on 09.04.2012, the Hon'ble  Islamabad High Court, 
Islamabad pleased  to order for  transfer  of cases  to the East  Division  which was 
pending  in the  West Division.  The judgment  and decree  in question  having  been 
passed  on  11.01.2012,  was  thus  not  passed  without  territorial  jurisdiction. 
However, after 28. 02. 2012 all the proceedings  conducted, during the pendency  of 
execution  petition,  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  West,  Islamabad,  were  without 
authority, till its transfer to the District Division East." 

26.  The  crux  of the  matter  being  that  despite  division  of the  Islamabad 

Capital  Territory 

into 

two  districts  by  virtue  of  Notification 

No.14(l)Admin/201  l  dated  24.05.2011,  till  28.02.2012  there  were  no 

separate Civil Courts for the newly formed East Division and it was not until 

09-04-2012 that this  Court ordered the transfer of cases to the East Division 

from the West Division.  As such, the Impugned Judgment  & Decree passed 

on  11-01-2012 was not  without jurisdiction.  The aforesaid  factual position 

11 

C.R  No.53/2016, C.R  No.162/2016  & W.P  No.286412015. 

has  not  been  controverted  by the  learned  counsel  for the  Petitioner.  Both  the 

Courts  below  have  reached  a finding  against  the  Petitioner  after  scanning  the 

relevant  facts  and  applicable 

law  and  such  concurrent  findings  cannot  be 

interfered  with  in the  exercise  of Constitutional  jurisdiction in the  absence  of 

any  legal  infirmity  which  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  has  failed  to 

do.  Therefore,  I  find  that  the  Petitioner's  application  under  Section  12(2), 

C.P.C.,  was  correctly  dismissed  vide  the  Impugned  Order  I  and  Impugned 

Judgment  III. 

27. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  C.R  No.152/2015, 

and  Writ  Petition 

No.2864/2015  are  dismissed  as  being  devoid  of  merit  and  as  such  the 

Impugned  Order  I  (to  the  extent  of  Petitioner's  application  under  Section 

12(2),  C.P.C.,)  and  Impugned  Judgment  III are  upheld. 

28.  Whereas  C.R  No.53/2016  and  the  Petitioner's  application  under 

Order  IX,  Rule  13,  C.P.C.,  are  allowed  with  the  result  that  the  Impugned 

Order  I  dated  09.12.2014 

(to  the  extent  of  Petitioner's  application  under 

Order  IX,  Rule  13, C.P.C.)  and  Judgment  II  dated  09.03.2015  as  well  as the 

Ex-parte  Judgment  and  Decree  dated  11-01-2012  are  hereby  set  aside  and 

the  learned  Trial  Court  is directed  to hear  and  decide  the  suit  on  merits.
