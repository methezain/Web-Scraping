Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submits  that  property  jointly  owned  by  the 

judgment  debtor  and  his  brother  has  been  de-

attached  by  the  executing  Court  by  way  of 

accepting  the  objection  application  filed  by  the 

brother  of  the  judgment  debtor.  An  appeal 

against the said order has been filed which was 

also dismissed on the ground that order, dated 

08.11.2021  is  merely  an  interlocutory  order, 

against which no appeal lies. Hence the instant 

petition.
