Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

6. 

Being  aggrieved  of  the  impugned 

judgments  /  decrees  dated  11.09.2021, 

and  orders  /  decrees  dated  07.02.2019 

passed in both the above mentioned suits, 

the instant writ petition has been filed.  

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter alia,  contends  that  the  impugned 

judgments, orders and decrees are against 

the law and facts of the case.  

8. 

That 

the 

petitioner  had 

no 

knowledge  of 

filing  of 

the  above 

mentioned  suits  by  the  respondent  No.1, 

hence,  ex-parte  orders  were  wrongly 

passed against the petitioner.  

9. 

That  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  are  not  speaking  and  also  not 

passed  on  reasoning  rather  based  upon 

assumptions 

and  presumptions; 

the 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  are 

result of illegalities and irregularities which 

resulted into grave miscarriage of justice.  

10. 

That  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees have been passed in a post haste 

and  arbitrary  manner,  hence  are  not 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

sustainable  in  the  eyes  of  law  and  are 

liable to be set aside.  

11.  Arguments heard, record perused.  

12.  Marriage  of 

the  petitioner  was 

solemnized  with    respondent  No.1/Mst. 

Noureen  Tabassum,  according  to  Muslim 

Rights  and  Ceremonies  on  15.11.2014.  At 

the  time  of  marriage  deferred  dower 

amounting to Rs. 5,00,000/- was fixed.  

13. 

From  wedlock  of  the  parties,  one 

minor  son  was  born  on  04.11.2016. 

Thereafter,  relations  between  the  parties 

became  strain  and  respondent  No.1  &  2/ 

wife  and  son  were  thrown  out  of  the 

house  by 

the  petitioner  and  also 

pronounced divorce upon respondent No.1 

through SMS. 

14.  Respondent  No.1  filed  a  civil  suit 

No.411/2018  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance  and  medical  expenses  etc.  and

5 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

15.  After  filing  of  the  suits,  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  issued  notices  to  the 

petitioner/defendant  through  courier  i.e. 

TCS  which  were  duly  served  upon  the 

petitioner  on  01.10.2018  at  05:54  p.m.. 

The  notices  were 

received  by 

the 

petitioner  personally  and  courier  tracking 

report  is  also  available  on  record  but  the 

petitioner  did  not  opt 

to 

join 

the 

proceedings,  hence  the  ex-parte  orders 

were  passed;  ex-parte  evidence  of 

respondent  No.1/plaintiff  was  recorded 

and  both  the  suits  were  decreed  in  favor 

of  respondent  No.1  on  07.02.2019,  and 

the following reliefs were granted to her:  

“(i)  Respondent  No.1/plaintiff 

was  entitled  to  receive  an 

amount  of  Rs.  10,000/-per 

month for her Iddat period.  

(ii)  Respondent No.2 / minor 

was  entitled  to  receive  an 

amount  of  Rs.  8,000/-  per 

month w.e.f January, 2018 till 

 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

his legal entitlement with 10% 

annual increase.  

(iii)  Respondent  No.1/plaintiff 

was  entitled  to  receive  an 

amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- in lieu 

of her deferred dower.  

(iv)  Respondent  No.1/plaintiff 

was entitled to receive back the 

dowry articles except the car in 

lieu  of  the  dowry  articles  an 

amount  of  Rs.  1,50,000/- 

against  the  market  value  of 

dowry articles.”         

16. 

Petitioner 

filed  applications 

for 

setting  aside 

the 

impugned  ex-parte 

orders  and  decrees  in  both  the  suits  on 

26.07.2019 which were dismissed for non-

prosecution  and  were 

restored  on 

22.10.2020.  

17.  Reasons  mentioned 

in 

the 

applications  for  setting  aside  ex-parte 

orders  and  decrees  in  para-3  were  that 

notices  or  summons  were  not  properly 

served upon the petitioner but he came to 

 
 
 
 
   
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

know about the pendency of suits through 

his relative whose case was  also pending 

in  the  same  learned  Court.  In  para-5  of 

the  same  application,  the  petitioner  has 

mentioned 

that 

on 

20.06.2019, 

respondent  No.1/plaintiff  called  the  sister 

of 

the  petitioner  and 

informed  her 

regarding the pendency of suits.  

18.  Both 

the 

applications  were 

dismissed vide order dated 11.06.2021, by 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  and  appeals 

were  also  dismissed  by  the  Court  of 

learned 

Additional 

District 

Judge, 

Islamabad.  

19.  Condition  of  deferred  dower  of  Rs. 

5,00,000/- 

is  mentioned 

in 

the 

Nikkahnama  and  the  amount  of  Rs. 

8,000/-  as  maintenance  of  minor  is  also 

justified  and  not  an  exorbitant  amount. 

The  dowry  articles  are  also  liable  to  be 

returned  by  the  petitioner  to  respondent 

No.1, and the maintenance of Iddat period 

is also liable to be paid by the petitioner to 

respondent  No.1  in  accordance  with  law, 

 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

hence  no  prejudice  has  caused  to  the 

petitioner  from  the  passing  of  impugned 

judgments / decrees.  

20. 

Suits were filed on 25.09.2018, and 

decided  on  07.02.2019.  The  conduct  of 

the  petitioner  shows  that  he  remained 

silent  till  final  decision  of  suits  and 

deliberately  opted  not 

to 

join 

the 

proceedings  and  after  passing  of  the 

impugned judgments/decrees, he filed the 

applications  for  setting  aside  the  ex-parte 

judgment / order / decrees. After filing of 

applications  he  also  did  not  pursue  the 

same  which  were  dismissed  for  non-

prosecution and again were restored after 

a period of more than one year of filing of 

the applications.  

21.  Conduct  of  the  petitioner  clearly 

shows  that  he  wants  to  drag  respondent 

No.1 / his ex-wife in the Courts / litigation 

unnecessarily.  

22.  When  confronted,  learned  counsel 

for  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out 

any  illegality  or  prejudice  caused  to  the 

 
 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

petitioner due to the passing of impugned 

judgments / decrees.      

23. 

It  is  trite  that  in  order  to  get 

discretionary  and  equitable  relief,  the 

parties  should  approach  the  Courts  with 

clean hands. Reference in this regard may 

be made to the following case laws:- 

(i) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

“Shafqatullah  and  others  VS 

District  and  Sessions  Judge, 

Nowshera,  N.W.F.P  and  4 

others” (2001 SCMR 274), it has 

been held as follows:- 

“It would also appear from 

the  record  that  the 

petitioners 

did 

not 

approach  the  High  Court 

with clean hands entitling 

them to the discretionary, 

equitable  relief  under  the 

Constitutional jurisdiction”. 

(ii) 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Manzoor 

Hussain  and  3  others  VS 

Muhammad  Siddique”  (2000 

 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

CLC 623 [Lahore]), it  has  been 

held as follows:- 

“The  grant  or  refusal  of 

declaration  is  essentially 

discretionary  and  in  this 

case,  to  my  mind,  the 

plaintiff  had  forfeited  his 

right to an equitable relief 

by putting up a false case”. 

The  same  principle  has  been  laid  down  in 

cases  titled  as  “Shahnaz  Parveen  and 

another VS Javed Yaqoob and other” 

(2020  MLD  638  [Islamabad])  and 

“University of the Punjab and another 

VS Malik Jehangir Khan” (1994 PLC(CS) 

314 [Lahore]). 

24. 

Further, 

there  are 

concurrent 

findings of  both  the  learned  Courts  below 

against 

the  petitioner. 

In  case  of 

concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below, 

scope  of 

the  constitutional  petition 

becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner  has 

failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading  of  the  evidence.  It  has  been  laid 

down  in  a  case  titled  as  “Syed Arif Ali 

 
 
 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

Sabri VS Abdul Samad through L.Rs. 

and 2 others” (2008 YLR 2309)” that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

interfered when the orders of the 

Courts below are fanciful or based 

on misreading or non-reading of 

the evidence".  The  same  view  has 

also  been  taken  in  a  case  titled  as 

“Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad Ali 

and  others”  (PLD  2008  Karachi 

2005). 

25. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is 

only available  to quash  a  decision  for  an 

error  of  law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for 

correcting  errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an 

inferior  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction, 

or  fails  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  or 

where  the  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts 

illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a  matter  in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice.  The  High  Court  while  issuing  a 

 
 
 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

writ  of  certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction. The High Court in exercise of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court  or  a  tribunal.  Reliance  may  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan  VS  Muhammad  Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle  of  law  that  the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the discretion exercised by 

lower  courts  unless  the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has  been  passed  without 

 
 
 
13 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence, or is  not  in 

accordance with the law. If 

none  of  these  errors  is 

present,  the  High  Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

a different conclusion as to 

the  controversy  than  the 

latter.  In  this  regard, 

reference can be made to a 

collective reading of Mst. 

Mobin 

Fatima 

v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad 

(1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii)  In  a  case  titled  as "President 

All 

Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt 

VS  Muhammad  Akbar  Awan 

and others” (2020 SCMR 260), 

it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It is settled law that when 

the  Statute  does  not 

 
 
 
14 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

same cannot be challenged 

by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court in order 

to gain a similar objective. 

Where  a  Statute  has 

expressly barred a remedy 

which is not available to a 

party under the Statute, it 

cannot be sought indirectly 

by 

resort 

to 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court. The High 

Courts 

exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

advancing the policy of law 

and delivering expeditious 

justice in accordance with 

the 

law  and 

the 

Constitution. 

Even 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and discretionary in nature 

and  should  not  be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass  the  purpose  of  a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

 
 
15 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it  is 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"Where  the  Court  or  the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such determination cannot 

ordinarily  be  interfered 

with  by  the  High  Court 

while 

exercising 

jurisdiction  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution."  

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it is 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

 
 
 
16 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate court/Tribunal 

in a fair and just manner 

without  violating  or 

disregarding 

statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned Judges of the High 

Court for future course of 

action:  (i)  Brig.  (Rtd.) 

Imtiaz 

Ahmed 

v. 

Government  of  Pakistan, 

through Secretary, Interior 

Division, Islamabad (1994 

SCMR 2142), (ii) Shahnaz 

Begum  v.  The  Hon'ble 

Judges of the High Court of 

Sindh  and  Balochistan 

(PLD 1971 SC 677),  (iii) 

Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar v. 

Ghulam  Qasim  Khan 

 
 
17 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

Khakwani  (PLD  1994  SC 

281).  

(v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam VS Muhammad Siddique 

and 2 others” (PLD 2007 SC 

45),  it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court that: 

"The High Court in exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional 

jurisdiction 

is 

not 

supposed  to  interfere  in 

the  findings  on  the 

controversial  question  of 

facts  based  on  evidence 

even  if  such  finding  is 

erroneous.  The  scope  of 

the judicial review of the 

High  Court  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution in 

such  cases,  is  limited  to 

the extent of misreading or 

non-reading of evidence or 

if the finding is based on 

no  evidence  which  may 

cause  miscarriage  of 

justice but it is not proper 

for  the  High  Court  to 

disturb the finding of fact 

through  reappraisal  of 

evidence 

in 

writ 

jurisdiction or exercise this 

 
 
18 

Writ Petition No. 3676 of 2021 

jurisdiction as a substitute 

of revision or appeal”. 

26. 

For what has been discussed above, 

the orders and decrees dated 07.02.2019, 

orders  dated  11.06.2021,  passed  by  the 

learned Family/Guardian Judge, Islamabad 

as  well  as  Judgments  dated  11.09.2021, 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge,  West-Islamabad  are  in  accordance 

with  law  and  facts  of  the  matter  and  do 

not require interference by this Court. The 

writ  petition  is  not  maintainable,  hence 

dismissed in limine being meritless with 

no order as to costs.
