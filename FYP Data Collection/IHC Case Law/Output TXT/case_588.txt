MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB J.-  Through the  instant writ 

petition,  the  petitioner  (Hania  Obaid)  has  called  in  question  the 

assumption  of  jurisdiction  by  respondent  No.1  (Chairman,  Arbitration 

Council 

/  Union  Council  No.13,  Humak, 

Islamabad),  and 

the 

proceedings  conducted  by  him  in  case  No.UCH  13(55)/2021,  which 

were  initiated  pursuant  to  the  pronouncement  of  divorce  dated 

25.07.2021  through  notice 

issued  by  respondent  No.2  (Obaid 

Salikeen) to the petitioner. 

2. 

The  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  got  married  on  09.11.2011. 

The Nikahnama was registered on 13.11.2011 at Ward No.14, which is 

located  in  Rawalpindi.  The  couple  went  to  the  United  States  of 

America (“U.S.A.”). They don’t have any children. Over the years, their 

matrimonial relations deteriorated leading to their separation. 

3. 

On 25.07.2021, when the petitioner and respondent No.2 were in 

Pakistan,  the 

latter  pronounced  divorce  (talaq)  and  sent  the 

talaqnama to the petitioner on her father’s address (i.e., House No.14, 

Street  No.9,  Sector  H,  Phase-II,  Defense  Housing  Authority, 

Islamabad). A notice of the divorce was also sent by respondent No.2 

on  29.07.2021  to  the  Chairman  Union  Council  –  13  (Humak), 

Islamabad.  The  petitioner’s  father’s  address  is  within  the  territorial 

limits of the said Union Council.  

4. 

Respondent  No.1  sent  notices  to  the  petitioner  and  respondent 

No.2  requiring  them  to  attend  the  proceedings  for  reconciliation 

 
 
                
 
 
 
 
 
  
2                                                  W.P.No.3571/2021 

scheduled for 04.08.2021. The notice to the petitioner was sent at her 

father’s address. 

5. 

Vide 

letter  dated  13.08.2021, 

the  petitioner’s 

father 

acknowledged  receipt  of  the  notice  from  respondent  No.1  and 

informed  the  latter  that  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  were 

residing  in  the  State  of  California,  U.S.A.  The  petitioner’s  father  also 

provided  the  petitioner’s  residential  address 

in  the  U.S.A.  to 

respondent  No.1  so  as  to  serve  the  petitioner  on  her  said  address  in 

the  U.S.A.  On  31.08.2021,  the  petitioner’s  father  addressed  another 

letter  to  respondent  No.1  wherein  the  position  taken  in  the  earlier 

letter dated 13.08.2021 was reiterated.  

6. 

Respondent  No.1  sent  another  notice  to  the  petitioner  at  her 

father’s  address  requiring  her  to  appear  for  the  reconciliation 

proceedings  scheduled  for  02.09.2021.  It  is  an  admitted  position  that 

the petitioner did not attend any proceedings for reconciliation.  

7. 

On  06.10.2021,  the  petitioner  filed  the  instant  writ  petition 

seeking  a  declaration  to  the  effect  that  the  proceedings  before 

respondent  No.1  were  without  lawful  authority  and  of  no  legal  effect. 

Furthermore,  the  petitioner  has  sought  an  injunction  to  restrain 

respondent No.1 from proceeding further with the matter. 

8. 

It  may  be  mentioned  that  after  the  petitioner’s  return  to  U.S.A. 

she,  on  18.08.2021,  instituted  proceedings  against  respondent  No.2 

before the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda, U.S.A. for 

the dissolution of her marriage. The copy of the action instituted by the 

petitioner  before the  said  foreign  Court shows  the  date  of separation 

to be 05.08.2021 i.e., the date on which the petitioner left Pakistan for 

the U.S.A. On 15.09.2021, respondent No.2 objected to the jurisdiction 

of  the  said  foreign  Court  and  has  sought  an  order  for  quashing  the 

proceedings 

from  that  Court.  Before  the  said 

foreign  Court, 

respondent  No.2  has  also  asserted  that  on  29.07.2021,  he  applied  to 

respondent No.1 for the issuance of certificate of divorce.  

9. 

The race between the petitioner and respondent No.2 as to who 

obtains  the  divorce  certificate  earlier  would  have  consequences  on 

the  quantum  of  maintenance  and  alimony  payable  to  the  petitioner. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2  candidly  admitted  that  if  the 

 
 
3                                                  W.P.No.3571/2021 

divorce  proceedings  in  Pakistan  are  finalized  earlier,  the  petitioner’s 

entitlements would be governed by the personal law  applicable to the 

parties. 

10.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  after  narrating  the  facts 

leading to the filing of the instant petition, submitted that the petitioner 

did  not  receive  a  notice  of  divorce  under  Section  7  of  the  Muslim 

Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961  ("M.F.L.O.")  at  the  Union  Council  at 

Rawalpindi  where  the Nikahnama  was  registered;  that  the  petitioner 

also  did  not  receive  the  notice  of  divorce  which  was  sent  to  her 

father’s  address;  that  respondent  No.2  was  under  an  obligation  to 

issue the divorce notice to the petitioner at her residential address in 

California,  U.S.A.;  that  unless  a  divorce  notice  was  issued  at  the 

petitioner’s  said  residential  address, 

the  proceedings  before 

respondent  No.1  were  coram non judice;  and  that  the  petitioner  did 

not reside at her father’s address during her stay in Pakistan between 

22.07.2021 and 05.08.2021. 

11.  Furthermore,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that 

respondent  No.2  has  been  able  to  obtain  a  divorce  registration 

certificate dated  10.01.2022  from  Union  Council  No.37 (Dhoke Dalal), 

Rawalpindi; that apparently respondent No.2 had sent a divorce notice 

to  the  said  Union  Council  which  issued  the  divorce  registration 

certificate;  that  the  petitioner  had  never  received  any  divorce  notice 

at  Rawalpindi;  that  the  petitioner  has  assailed  the  said  divorce 

registration certificate in writ petition No.184/2022 before the Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench  and  has  also  obtained  an 

injunctive  order;  and 

that  respondent  No.2  cannot 

take  a 

contradictory  position  by  asserting  that  he  had  sent  a  divorce  notice 

to  Union  Council  No.37  (Dhoke  Dalal),  Rawalpindi  as  well  as  Union 

Council  –  13  (Humak),  Islamabad.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

prayed for the writ petition to be allowed in terms of the relief sought 

therein. 

12.  On  the  other  hand, 

learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2 

submitted  that  respondent  No.2  had  pronounced  divorce  on  the 

petitioner while she was at Pakistan; that the divorce notice was sent 

at  her  father’s  address  where  she  was  residing;  that  the  petitioner’s 

 
 
4                                                  W.P.No.3571/2021 

father’s  letters  dated  13.08.2021  and  31.08.2021  show  that  the 

petitioner  was  in  the  knowledge  of  the  divorce  proceedings;  that  the 

petitioner  had  also  executed  a  special  power  of  attorney  on 

05.10.2021  in  favour  of  her  brother,  Muhammad  Zain,  who  resides  at 

the same address as her father, authorizing him to inter alia file and / 

or defend any legal proceedings or appeal or revision filed or initiated 

in respect of the proceedings commenced in the arbitration Council at 

Islamabad;  that  in  the  said  power  of  attorney,  it  is  clearly  mentioned 

that the petitioner had pronounced talaq on the petitioner vide divorce 

deed dated 25.07.2021 and the proceedings for the issuance of a talaq 

effectiveness certificate are pending before the Arbitration Council at 

Islamabad;  and  that  it  is  not  conceivable  that  the  petitioner  did  not 

know  about  the  notice  for  divorce  sent  at  her  father’s  address  at  the 

time when the petitioner was in Pakistan. 

13.  Learned counsel for respondent No.2 further submitted that the 

divorce registration certificate dated 10.01.2022 had not been issued 

on  the  basis  of  any  notice  sent  by  respondent  No.2  to  Union  Council 

No.37  (Dhok  Dalal),  Rawalpindi;  that  respondent  No.2  was  not  in  the 

knowledge  of  any  proceedings  before  the  said  Union  Council;  that 

respondent  No.2  shall  not  object  to  writ  petition  No.184/2022  filed 

before  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court,  Rawalpindi  Bench  so  that  the 

said  divorce  registration  certificate  is  quashed;  and  that  it  is  the 

petitioner  who  has  maneuvered  the  issuance  of  the  said  divorce 

registration  certificate.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2  prayed 

for  the  writ  petition  to  be  dismissed  so  that  the  proceedings  before 

respondent No.1 are taken to their logical conclusion expeditiously. 

14.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  submitted  that  the 

provisions of the M.F.L.O. are applicable to the whole of Pakistan; that 

under  Section  7  of  the  M.F.L.O.,  a  husband  has  a  right  to  divorce  his 

wife and send a notice of pronouncement of divorce to the Arbitration 

Council; that the purpose of the notice is that an Arbitration Council be 

constituted  to  make efforts  for bringing  about  reconciliation  between 

the parties; that if reconciliation is not possible, then after an expiry of 

ninety  days,  the  divorce  certificate  is  issued  by  the  Arbitration 

Council; that the petitioner was in the knowledge of the divorce having 

 
 
5                                                  W.P.No.3571/2021 

been pronounced on her by respondent No.2; and that the notice has 

to  be  sent  to  the address  where  the  wife  last  resided  in  cases  where 

her  whereabouts  are  not  known.  He  submitted  that  this  Court  may 

pass an order as it deems appropriate. 

15. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance.  

16.  The  facts  leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have  been 

set out in sufficient detail in paragraphs 2 to 8 above, and need not be 

recapitulated.  

17.  Section 7(1) of the M.F.L.O. provides that any man who wishes to 

divorce his wife shall, as soon as may be after  the pronouncement  of 

talaq  in  any  form  whatsoever,  give  the  Chairman  notice  in  writing  of 

his  having  done  so,  and  shall  supply  a  copy  thereof  to  his  wife.  Rule 

3(b)  of  the  West  Pakistan  Rules  under  the  Muslim  Laws  Ordinance, 

1961 ("the 1961 Rules") provides that in case of notice of talaq under 

Section 7(1) it shall be the Union Council of the Union or Town where 

the wife in relation to whom talaq has been pronounced  was residing 

at the time of pronouncement of talaq which shall have jurisdiction  in 

the matter.   

18.  Respondent  No.2  pronounced  talaq  on  the  petitioner  on 

25.07.2021.  On  the  said  date,  the  petitioner  was  admittedly  in 

Pakistan. She has explicitly pleaded in paragraph 5 of the instant writ 

petition that between 22.07.2021 and 05.08.2021 she was in Pakistan. 

Notice of divorce was sent by respondent No.2 to the petitioner at her 

father’s address. Notice of divorce was also sent by respondent No.2 

to  respondent  No.1  within  whose  territorial  limits  the  petitioner’s 

father  resides.  In  the  instant  writ  petition,  it  is  categorically  pleaded 

that  the  petitioner  was 

in  Pakistan  between  22.07.2021  and 

05.08.2021.  She  asserts  that  during  her  stay  in  Pakistan,  she  “spent 

time with her family and cousins, albeit visited however never resided 

at House No.14, Street No.9, Sector H, Phase-II, Defense Housing 

Authority, Islamabad.”  

19.  The  petitioner’s  father  addressed  letters  dated  13.08.2021  and 

31.08.2021 

to  respondent  No.1 

informing 

the 

latter 

that 

the 

 
 
6                                                  W.P.No.3571/2021 

petitioner’s residential address was in the U.S.A. and that she should 

be  served  with  the  notices  on  the  address  mentioned  in  the  said 

letters.  These  letters  do  not  mention  the  date  when  the  notice  of 

divorce was received at the petitioner’s father’s address.  

20.  Rule 3-A of the 1961 Rules permits the giving of notice of a talaq 

to  the  wife  through  her father,  mother,  adult  brother  or  adult  sister  if 

the whereabouts of the wife are not known to the husband and cannot 

with due diligence, be ascertained by him. For giving such a notice, he 

has  to  obtain  permission  of  the  Chairman,  Arbitration  Council.  In  the 

case  at  hand,  no  such permission was  taken since it  was  respondent 

No.2’s  assertion  that  the  petitioner  resided  with  her  father  while  she 

was in Pakistan. 

21.  Learned counsel for the petitioner was tight-lipped about where 

the  petitioner  resided  when  in  Pakistan.  He  would  just  not  tell  the 

Court  where  the  petitioner  resided  while  she  was  in  Pakistan.  For 

hoodwinking this question, I could have dismissed this writ petition on 

equitable considerations. However,  in these circumstances, I deem it 

appropriate  to  exercise  restraint  and  leave  the  matter  regarding 

whether  respondent  No.1  has  jurisdiction  to  proceed  with  the  matter 

to  be  decided  by  respondent  No.1,  which  may  record  evidence  if  it 

deems  necessary  to  determine  whether  the  notice  for  divorce  had 

been issued in accordance with the law. For this purpose, the matter 

is  remitted  to  respondent  No.1  with  the  direction  to  decide  the  same 

expeditiously  and  preferably  within  two  weeks  from  the  date  of  the 

receipt of this Order. 

22.  Disposed of in the above terms.
