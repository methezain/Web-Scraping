the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.1  got  married 

in  the  year  2015  and  out  of  their  wedlock  one

used 

to

in-habit  of  using 

filthy

her; 

that 

after 

the  marriage,

contact  with  her  and  also  failed 

to  pay  any 

maintenance. 

4- 

It  is  further  maintained  that  after  arrival 

from  Saudi Arabia,  petitioner  paid  no  heed to  the 

respondents  1&2  and  all  expenses  were  born  by 

the  respondent's 

family  member  and  that  on 

19.10.2019, 

petitioner 

thrown 

out 

the 

respondents 

from 

the  house  and 

they  are 

residing  with  her  parents  since then.

to 

notice, 

petitioner/defendant  entered  appearance  before 

the  court  and  filed  written  statement  wherein  he 

categorically  denied  all  the  allegations  levelled  by 

the  respondent/plaintiff.  The  learned  trial  court 

fixed 

the  matter 

for  pre-trial 

reconciliation 

proceedings,  which  ended 

into 

failure  and 

thereafter 

fixed  interim  maintenance  allowance 

at 

the 

rate  of  Rs.12,000/-  per  month

8- 

Arguments  heard.  Record perused. 

Under  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964  (Act  of  1964), 

family 

court  is  competent  to  fix  interim  maintenance  and 

remedy  of  appeal  or  revision  against  the  interim 

order  is  barred  in  terms  of  Section  14 of the  West 

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act  1964  which  stipulates 

that:- 

WP 227 of 2022

"No appeal  or  revision  shall  lie  against 
an  interim  order  passed  by  a  Family 
Court." 

9. 

The Act  of  1964,  being  a  special  law,  bars 

remedy  of  appeal  or  revision  against 

interim 

order, 

therefore,  when  a  statute  specifically 

excludes  a  remedy,  petition 

in  terms  of  Article 

199  of  the  Constitution  cannot  be  held  to  be 

maintainable  against  the  said  order  as  it  would 

amount 

to  circumvent 

the 

intention  of 

the 

legislature  and  frustrate  the  express  provision  of 

law. 

10. 

This  Court 

in  the  case  of  "Dr.  Agueel 

Waris  v.  Ibrahim  Agueel  Waris"  (2020  CLC 131- 

Islamabad),  after  surveying  case  law  on  the 

subject  has  held  that 

"While  considering 

the 

above  discussion, 

interlocutory  orders  of 

the 

Judge  Family  Court  could  not  be  assailed 

in 

constitutional  jurisdiction,  even  though  in  some 

of cases they  are  harsh,  but  the  determination  of 

adequacy  or 

inadequacy  of 

the  quantum  of 

maintenance  would  certainly 

require 

factual 

evidence  or  inquiry  which  cannot  be  made  in  the 

proceedings  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution 

of  the  Islamic  Republic  of Pakistan,  1973,  as held 

in  2018  CLC Note  43  (Shameneh  Haider  and 

others  v.  Haider  Ali  Khan),  2011  MLO  1105 

Lahore  (Aamir  Mehmood  Hussain  v.  Niha  Aamir 

Saeed),  2015  YLR 2364  (Tahir  Ayub  Khan  v. 

Miss  Aalia  Anwar),  PLO  2012  Lahore  420 

(Ibrar  Hussain  v.  Mehwish  Rana and  others),  and 

PLO  2013  Lahore  64 

(Muhammad  Shahbaz 

Khalid  v.  Judge  Family  Court  Lahore)."

The  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

in  the 

case  of  "Dr.  Samina  Anayat  v.  Additional  District 

Judge  and  others"  (2018  MLD  448  Lahore), 

has held that:- 

of 

the 

"Perusal  of section  14(3)  of  West Pakistan 
Family  Court  Act,  1964,  shows  that  no 
appeal  or  revision  shall 
lie  against  an 
interim  order  passed  by  a  Family  Court. 
The Act  has  explicitly  barred  the  remedy 
of  appeal  or  revision  against  such  an 
order,  therefore, 
in  case  a  constitutional 
is  entertained  against  such  an 
petition 
the 
order,  it  will  amount  to  circumvent 
intention 
to 
and 
legislation

frustrate 
Reliance  in  this  respect  is  placed  upon 
Muhammad  Anwar  Khan  v.  Mst.  Yasmin 
Zafar  (1987  SCMR 2029),  Ms.  Quratulain 
Aleem  v.  Muhammad  Rehman  Khan  and 
another  (2006  YLR  2604)  and  Mst.  Noor 
v. 
Tasleem 
Jehan 
Muhammad  Arshad  and  another  (1986 
CLC 442).  Since  the  impugned  order  is an 
interlocutory  order  and  against  such  an 
order  constitution  petition  cannot  be filed, 
therefore,  the  petition  before  this  Court  is 
not  maintainable.  The  learned  Additional 
District  Judge  has  rightly  observed  in  the 
that  appeal  or  revision  against 
appeal 
not 
interlocutory 
maintainable."
