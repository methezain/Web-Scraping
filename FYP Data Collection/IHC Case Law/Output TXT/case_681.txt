Mr.  Rizwan  Faiz  Muhammad,  Advocate 
applicants. 

for 

Through 

the 

instant 

review  application 

Applicants 

have 

assailed 

order 

dated 

25.01.2022,  passed  by  this  Court  in  W.P  No. 

4634/2021  whereby 

the 

learned  Trial  Court 

was  directed 

to  conclude 

the 

trial,  pending 

between  the  parties,  within  one  month. 

2.  Learned 

counsel 

for 

the  Applicants 

submits  that  learned  Family  Court  in  pursuant 

to  the  above  directions, 

initiated  day  to  day 

proceedings 

from  14th  February, 

2022 

for 

recording  of evidence  of present  applicant; 

that 

Applicant  No.  1  being  working  lady  is  not  able 

to  appear  before  the  learned  trial  Court  on  day 

to  day 

basis; 

that 

despite 

request 

for 

adjournment 

on  behalf  of  applicant  No.  1, 

learned  trial  Court  has  not  entertained 

the  said 

request, 

therefore,  request  has  been  made  to 

review order  dated  25.01.2022. 

3. 

I  find  no  reason 

to  entertain 

the  instant 

application  as  the  same  is  completely  frivolous. 

Learned  Family  Court 

is  capable 

to  consider 

request 

for  adjournment 

by  examining 

its 

genuineness. 

4.  Learned  counsel 

for 

the  Applicants 

is 

directed 

to  appear  before  the  learned  Family 

Court 

with 

appropriate 

ground 

for 

adjournment. 

5. 

Instant 

review 

application 

stands 

dismissed in limine.
