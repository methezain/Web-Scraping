S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
20.08.2021  Nemo for the applicant.  

 C.M. No.3448 of 2021. 

This is an application seeking early 

fixation  of  the  petition.  Case  was  called  in 

the  earlier  Court  hours  but  no  one  has 

entered  appearance  on  behalf  of 

the 

applicant/petitioner.  The  case  was  kept 

pending  and  was  again  called  in  the  late 

hours but situation is same. The name of the 

counsel  for  the  applicant  /  petitioner  is 

reflected  in  the  cause  list.  There  is  no 

application  for  an  adjournment,  therefore, 

the instant application is dismissed for non-

prosecution.
