dated  25.11.2021, 

hence 

the 

instJt 

petition. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  contended 

that  the 

impugned  order  is  not  tenable  inasmudh 

as  the  interim  maintenance 

fixed  by  Je 

learned  trial  Court  is  beyond  the  financik 

status  of the  petitioner  and  learned  Trik 

Court 

has 

not 

considered

6.  Argument  heard,  record  perused. 

7. 

The 

Impugned  Order  has 

been 

passed 

in  pursuance  of  Section 

1 7 -A  olf 

the  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts  AcJ, 

1964,  where  under  the  Family  Court  hak 
I 

the  jurisdiction 

to  pass  interim  order  fa~ 

maintenance 

proceedings 

The  purpose 

at 

any 

stage 

I 
the 
in  a  suit  for  maintenancd  ,. 
the  provision  of 

behind 

of 

interim  maintenance 

is  to  ensure 

thJt 

during 

the 

pendency 

of 

the 

leg~ 

proceedings, 

the  minors  are  not  face~ 

with  financial  challenges. 

8. 

Section  14  (3) of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appe~

I  4j 

or 

revision 

against 

an 

interim  order 

passed 

by  a  Family  Court  with 

the 

obvious  purpose  to  avoid  delays. 

9.  The  Impugned  Order 

is  merely  an 

interlocutory 

order.  The  maintenance 

fixed 

through 

such  an  order 

is  only 

temporary.  The  quantum  of  maintenance 

may  be  modified  after  appraising 

the 

evidence  produced  at  trial.  An  aggrieved 

party  Will  have  a  right 

to  agitate  his 

grievance 

before 

the 

appellate  Court 

when 

the 

interim  order  merges 

into  a 

final  order.  Even  otherwise,  quantum 

ofi 

interim  maintenance, 

being  a 

factual 

dispute  cannot  be  made  a  ground 

for 

invoking  the  Constitutional 

jurisdiction  ofi 

this  Court. 

10. 

I  am  guided  by  the  consistent  view 

taken  by  different  Honorable  Benches  ofi 

the  Islamabad  High  Court,  Islamabad 

in 

various  matters 

including 

the  reported 

cases 

of 

Dr. 

AqueeZ 

Waris  VS Ibrahim  Aqueel  Waris, 

2020  CLC  131;  Minhaaj  Saqib  VS 

Najam  Us  Saqib, 

2018  CLC  5061 

Mashkoor  Ahmed  Khokhar  VS Thj 

Family  Judge  (East),  Islamabad,  2019J 

CLC 1635;  Muhammad  Touseeq  Danial

Muniri 

Puri  VS Mst.  Saima  Naeem,  2021 

W.P 

4552/2021 

IS 

YLR 2166,  wherein  it  has  been  held  that 

interlocutory  orders  by  the  Family  Court 

cannot 

be  assailed 

in  Constitutional 

jurisdiction 

even 

though 

they  may  be 

harsh 

in  some 

instances.  The 

instant 

petition  is,  therefore,  not  maintainable. 

11.  Caselaw  relied  upon  by  the  learned 

counsel 

for 

the  Petitioner 

does  not 

advance  his  case.  The  cases  of Basharat 

Ali (Supra)  and  Memoona  Ilyas  (Supra)  do 

not  pertain 

to  orders  regarding 

interim 

maintenance.  As  far  as  the  case  of  Dr. 

Aqeel  Waris 

(Supra) 

is  concerned, 

the 

same  does  not  support  his  contention, 

in 

fact  has  been  relied  upon  by  this  Court 

as 

discussed 

above 

to 

reach 

the 

conclusion  hereof. 

12.  Thus, 

in 

the 

light  of  above  said 

discussion  and  keeping  in  view the  above 

said  observations  by  this  Court 

in  the 

aforementioned 

cases 

the 

Impugned 

Order  dated  13.10.2021  passed  by  thei 

learned 

Judge, 

Family  Court,  East  

Islamabad,  does  not  call  for  interference 

in  writ  jurisdiction. 

Consequently, 

thisl 

Writ Petition  is hereby  dismissed.
