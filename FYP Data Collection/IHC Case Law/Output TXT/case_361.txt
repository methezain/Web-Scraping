On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 

Respondents  drew  the  attention  of  this  Court  to  the 

last  order  dated  29.07.2022,  wherein  it  has  been 

recorded  that  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents 

stated that despite orders of the Trial Court as well as 

Appellate  Court  no  amount  has  been  paid  towards 

the  maintenance  of  the  minor/Respondent  No.2  till 

date  and  on  the  basis  of  such  statement,  the 

Petitioner  was  directed  to  apprise  this  Court  as  to 

whether  or  not  maintenance  is  being  paid  for  the 

minor/Respondent  No.2  and  that  in  case  of  non-

payment  of  the  maintenance  or  insufficient  amount, 

instant writ petition shall not be entertained.

Today, the learned counsel for the Respondent 

No.1 submitted that no amount whatsoever has been 

paid by the Petitioner towards the maintenance of the 

minor/Respondent No.2, which was not controverted 

by the Petitioner.   

4. 

In  view  of 

the 

foregoing, 

this  Court 

announced  dismissal  of 

the 

instant  petition.  

However,  it  has  been  noted  that  the  Respondents 

No.1  and  2  were  declared  to  be  proceeded  against 

ex-parte  on  20-10-2020  and  no  application  for 

setting aside the said order is available on the record.  

Moreover,  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree, 

whereby 

the  maintenance  was 

fixed 

for 

the

dated 17.11.2020.  Since then, the Petitioner appears 

to  be  lingering  on  the  matter  and  requesting  for 

adjournment on repeated basis.

Therefore, in view of above,  the stay granted 

vide order dated 17.11.2020 stands vacated as in any 

event  it  was  granted  till  the  next  date  and  was  not 

extended  thereafter.    The  Petitioner  is  given  last 

opportunity  to  pursue  his  case  and  it  is  made  clear 

that  in  case  of  non-appearance  or  request  for 

adjournment for any reason, whatsoever, matter shall 

be dismissed for non-prosecution. Office is directed 

to  fix  the  matter  for  hearing  on  07.09.2022  after
