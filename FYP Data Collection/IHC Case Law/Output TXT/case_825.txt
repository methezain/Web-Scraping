03. 

It 

is  alleged  that 

the  petitioners 

along  with  co-accused  have 

forcibly 

entered  into  house  of  the  complainant 

while armed with  deadly weapons, beaten 

family  members  of 

the  complainant, 

resultantly  caused  injuries  upon  three 

(03)  persons and  also  torn  the  cloths  of 

Bhabi of  the  complainant  and  made  her 

naked  on  the  road,  hence  the  instant 

F.I.R. 

04.  Learned counsel for  the  petitioners  I 

accused,  inter  alia,  contends  that 

the 

petitioners/  accused are innocent; there  is 

no  evidence  available  against  them;  FIR 

has 

been 

registered  with  malafide 

intentions  and  by  ulterior  motives  just  in 

order  to  settle  the  score  of  the  family 

dispute 

and 

has 

prayed 

for 

the 

confirmation  of  bail  before arrest. 

05.  Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel 

assisted  by 

·  1earned  counsel 

for 

the 

complainant 

has 

controverted 

the 

.. 

I 

3 

Criminal Misc. No.  1222-B of 2021 

arguments  made  by  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioners  and  has  stated.  that 

petitioners/  accused are nominated in  the 

FIR; 

they  have  committed  a  heinous 

crime,  recovery of  incriminating  articles is 

liable  to  be  effected,  hence  bail  before 

arrest of  the  petitioners/  accused is  liable 

to  be  cancelled. 

06.  Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for 

the  petitioners  /  accused, 

learned State Counsel assisted by learned 

counsel  for  the  complainant  have  been 

heard and  record  has  been  perused with 

their  able assistance. 

07.  The  petitioners 

/  accused  have 

specifically  been  nominated  in  the  FIR; 

they  have  forcibly  entered  into  house of 

the  complainant  while  armed  with  dagger 

and  pistols,  inflicted  injuries  upon  three 

(03)  persons  with 

the  said  deadly 

weapons. 

08.  Medico  Legal  Reports of  the  victims 

4 

Criminal Misc. No.  1222-B of 2021 

are  on 

record.  Police  has 

recorded 

statements of five  (05)  witnesses U/S  161 

Cr.P.C,  who 

have 

supported 

the 

prosecution  story.  Statement  of  a 

lady 

whose  cloths  were  torn,  made  naked  on 

road, is  also  on  record. 

09. 

Investigating  Officer  has  stated  that 

he  needs  custody  of  the  petitioners  / 

accused  for  effecting  recovery  of  crime 

weapons  as  well  as 

for  collecting  the 

evidence. 

10. 

It  is  well  settled  principle of  law  that 

while  deciding the  bail  application,  before 

recording  of  evidence  in  the  trial  Court, 

only  tentative  assessment is  to  be  made 

by  the  Court  and  it  is  not  permissible to 

go  into  details of  evidence in  one  way  or 

the  other  that  might  prejudice the  case  of 

either  party.  In  this  regard  reliance  is 

placed  upon  the  cases  reported  as  J!Ul 

1994  SUJ1reme Court  65,  PLD 1994 

Sl!Jlreme Court 8&  2021  SCMR 111 

5 

Criminal Misc. No.  1222-B of 2021 

and 2020 SCMR 937. 

11.  Bail  before  arrest  cannot  be  claimed 

as  a  matter  of  legal right  in  each case  and 

also  it  cannot  be  expected  that  it  would 

be  granted 

in  each  case  unless  legal 

requirements  laid  down  are  met.  It  is  to 

be  kept  in  view  that  bail  granted  before 

arrest, causes setback in  investigation and 

can  stand  as  stumbling  block  in  the  way 

of 

recovery  of 

incriminating  articles. 

Reliance  is  placed  on  a  case  titled  as 

Waleed  Arfagat  VS  The  State  and 

another  (2021MLD1226). 

12. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of  Pakistan in  a  case titled 

as  Sarwar  Sultan  VS  The State  (PLO 

1994 Suoreme  Court 133),  that: 

"Grant of  pre-arrest  bail  means 

that  accused is  exempted  from 

joining  the investigation and by not 

joining 

the 

investigation, 

prosecution  case may  suffer  for 

want  of  recovery  of  incriminating 

articles  and  other  material,  which 

may  be necessary to  connect the 

6 

Criminal Misc. No.  1222-B of 2021 

accused  with 

commission  of 

alleged crime". 

13. 

It  is  well settled  law that  relief of  pre  

arrest  bail  is  granted  only  in  those  matters 

where  it  would  appear that  the  registration 

of  such  cases  was  passed  on  enmity  / 

malafide or where no offence was shown to 

have  been  committed  on  the  very  face  of 

record.  This  is  not  the  position  in 

the 

instant  case.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  the 

cases  reported  as  PLO  1983  Supreme 

Court  82,  1996  SCMR 74  and  1996 

SCMRZ1. 

14.  In  a  case  titled  as  Rana Abdul  Kha/ig 

VS  The State  and  others  (2019  SCMR 

112!l,_J,  it was held as  fol lows: 

"Grant of pre-arrest  bail is an extra 

ordinary 

remedy 

in 

criminal 

jurisdiction;  it  is  diversion of  usual 

course of  law, arrest  in  cognizable 

cases; a protection  to  the innocent 

being hounded on trump up charges 

through  abuse of  process of  law, 

therefore  a  petitioner  seeking 

judicial  protection  is  required  to 

reasonably  demonstrate 

that 

7 

Criminal Misc. No. 1222-B of 2021 

intended  arrest  is  calculated  to 

humiliate  him  with 

taints  of 

malafide;  it  is  not  a substitute  for 

post  arrest  bail  in  every run  of  the  · 

mill  criminal  case as  it  seriously 

hampers 

the 

course 

of 

investigation'~ 

15. 

In  the  recent  order  passed  by 

Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 

in  a 

case  titled  as  Kamran Attaullah  and 

another  VS  The  State,  passed in 

Criminal Petition No, 149-K of 2020, 

it was held  as  follows: 

"It  is  by  now  well  settled  that  the 

accused in  a  criminal  case cannot 

be  granted  anticipatory  bail 

to 

subvert  or  undermine investigative 

procedure/  process that  essentially 

include arrest in  order  to  bring  the 

statutory  exercise to its  logical end 

for 

effective  and  meaningful 

prosecution of  the  offence through 

collection of information /  evidence 

consequent upon arrest. Malafide, 

manifestly 

intriguing  upon  the 

intended  arrest, 

is 

the  only 

justification 

to  suspend or  divert 

the usual course of law, a step most 

extraordinary by all meens". 

8 

Criminal Misc. No. 1222-B of 2021 

16.  There can  be  no escape from  the fact 

that 

the  petitioners 

/  accused  are 

nominated  in  the  FIR  with  specific role that 

they  have  caused injuries  upon  three  (03) 

persons,  torn  the  cloths  of  innocent  lady 

and made her naked on the  road. 

17.  Recovery of  crime weapons as  well as 

other  evidence is  liable to  be  effected  from 

the  petitioners /  accused. There  is  sufficient 

evidence available on  record to  connect the 

petitioners  /  accused with  the  commission 

of crime. 

18.  Considering 

the  above 

facts  and 

circumstances, I  am  clear  in  my  mind  that 

the  petitioners  /  accused  have  failed  to 

make out  a  case  for  grant  of  pre-arrest bail. 

Consequently,  instant  bail  petition  stands 

dismissed.  Ad- 

interim 

bail  already 

granted  to  the  petitioners  /  accused vide 

order  dated  19.11.2021,  passed  by  this 

Court is  hereby re-called. 

9 

Criminal Misc. No. 1222-B of 2021 

19.  Needless  to  mention  that,  this  is  a 

tentative  assessment which  shall  not  affect 

the trial  of case in  any manner.
