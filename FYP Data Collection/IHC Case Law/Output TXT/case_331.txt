11. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

Rizwan  Ullah  Khalidi,  inter alia contends 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petitions Nos. 4186/2021 & 457/2022 

that learned appellant Court has enhanced 

the maintenance of the minors without any 

legal  and  cogent  evidence  /  justification; 

order of enchantment is not in accordance 

with  financial  status  of  petitioner  /  Rizwan 

Ullah Khalidi; order for payment of college 

/  school  fee  of  the  minors  is  also  not  in 

accordance  with 

law; 

the 

impugned 

judgments and decrees are contrary to the 

mandatory  provision  of  law  and  settled 

principle  enunciated  by  this  Court  as  well 

as  apex  Court  for  determination  of  the 

maintenance  allowance,  as  such  the  same 

are liable to be set-aside. 

12. 

Learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioners 

in  writ  petition  No.  457/2022,  has  stated 

that  the  petitioners  are  entitled  for  the 

monthly  maintenance  @  1,00,000/-  for 

each petitioner; as the respondent, Rizwan 

Ullah  Khalidi  is  earning  handsome  money, 

so 

the  amount  of  maintenance  be 

enhanced; 

the  modification  of  decree 

passed  by  the  appellant  Court,  whereby 

the  respondent,  Rizwan  Ullah  Khalidi  has 

 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petitions Nos. 4186/2021 & 457/2022 

been  exonerated  from  paying  the  monthly 

house  rent  is  not  justified;  the  impugned 

judgments and decrees are erroneous, not 

tenable  under 

the 

law,  hence 

the 

petitioners  are  entitled  for  the  past  and 

future  maintenance,  house  rent  according 

to the prayer, made in the writ petition.    

13.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

14.  At  the  time  of  filing  of  suits  by  the 

parties  before  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge 

(Judge  Family  Court),  West-Islamabad  as 

well  as  appeals  before 

the 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge,  West-Islamabad, 

the marriage between Rizwan Ullah Khalidi 

and Salma Shahid was intact, now learned 

counsel  for  Salma  Shahid  (ex-wife)  has 

informed  that  petitioner,  Rizwan  Ullah 

Khalidi  has  pronounced  divorce  on 

06.03.2022 and the arbitration counsel has 

issued divorce certificate on 07.03.2022. 

15. 

It  is  evident  that  Salma  Shahid, 

being  mother  of  three  daughters  did  not 

file a suit for dissolution of marriage, even 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petitions Nos. 4186/2021 & 457/2022 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  made 

efforts for reconciliation but the same were 

not  done  and  just  in  order  to  avoid  the 

payment  of  monthly  maintenance,  Rizwan 

Ullah Khalidi  has pronounced divorce upon 

her wife.  

16. 

Learned  trial  Court  has  recorded 

sufficient  evidence 

that 

the  petitioner 

Rizwan  Ullah  Khalidi  is  earning  handsome 

amount,  as  he  purchased  and  sold  many 

properties  in  Pakistan,  owner  of  expensive 

cars  and  expensive  properties  in  Pakistan. 

He  has  also  admitted  that  he  owns 

apartments 

in  Dubai 

for 

investment 

purposes.  

17.  The  first  daughter,  Aisha  Rizwan  is 

studying  in  medical  college,  the  second 

daughter  is  about  to  get  admission  in 

medical  college  and  the  third  daughter  is 

also showing good educational results.  

18.  The petitioner has contracted second 

marriage,  even  the  learned  counsel  for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petitions Nos. 4186/2021 & 457/2022 

Salma  Shahid  has  stated  that  he  has  also 

contracted third marriage.  

19. 

Learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

West-Islamabad 

has 

rightly 

fixed 

maintenance  of  the  petitioners  in  writ 

petition No. 457/2022 along with institution 

college  /  school  fee.  The  father  is  legally, 

morally  and  ethically  bound  to  pay  the 

maintenance  and  educational  charges  to 

his minors children. 

20.  As 

the  petitioner,  Rizwan  Ullah 

Khalidi  has  pronounced  divorce,  so  he 

cannot  be  held  responsible  for  paying  the 

house  rent  to  his  ex-wife,  as  monthly 

maintenance  of  the  minors  along  with 

payment of monthly educational charges of 

the minors is handsome amount and is also 

justified in all respects.  

21. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners 

in their respective writ petitions have failed 

to  point  out  any  illegality  in  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees.  It  is  well  settled 

that certiorari is only available to quash a 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

Writ Petitions Nos. 4186/2021 & 457/2022 

decision for an error of law. It will also be 

issued  for correcting errors  of  jurisdiction 

when  an  inferior  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts 

without  jurisdiction  or  in  excess  of  its 

jurisdiction,  or 

fails 

to  exercise 

its 

jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its 

undoubted  jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of 

natural  justice.  The  High  Court  while 

issuing a writ of certiorari acts in exercise 

of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction. The High Court in exercise of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal.  

22. 

In  this  regard,  reliance  is  placed 

upon  the  following  dictums  /  laws  laid 

down  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan:  

i.  Amjad Khan VS Muhammad 

Irshad  (Deceased) 

through 

LRs, (2020 SCMR 2155).  

ii.  President  All  Pakistan 

Women  Association,  Peshawar

Cantt VS Muhammad Akbar Awan 

and others (2020 SCMR 260). 

iii.  Chief Executive MEPCO and 

others VS Muhammad Fazil and

v.  Shajar Islam VS Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 

SC 45). 

23. 

For what has been discussed above, 

judgments  and  decrees  dated  13.10.2021 

& 28.05.2021, passed by learned Additional 

District Judge, West-Islamabad and learned 

Senior Civil Judge-III (Judge Family Court), 

West-Islamabad are in accordance with law 

and  facts  of  the  matter,  hence  do  not 

require any interference by this Court.  

24. 

In  view  of  above  prospective,  both 

the  above  mentioned  writ  petitions  are 

dismissed with no order as to costs.
