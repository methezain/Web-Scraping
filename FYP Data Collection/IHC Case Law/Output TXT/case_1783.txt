Mr. Zaka Ullah  Khan,  Advocate for petitioners.

Through this writ petition, the petitioners  have

assailed  the order  dated 24.07.2019,  passed by learned

Judge Family Court,  Islamabad,  whereby  right of

defendants/present  petitioners  to  conduct cross-

examination of the PW-1 was struck off.

2. 

Learned counsel  for the petitioners  inter-alis

contends that respondents No.1 & 2 have filed suit for

recovery of maintenance,  dower  and dowry  articles

against present petitioners before the Judge  Family

Court,  Islamabad,  whereby after submission  of written

statement  issues were  framed  on 30.05.2019  and the trial

Court has closed the right to cross-examine  the PW-1

without giving any opportunity  as such the petitioners

have  been deprived from their legal right, whereas  it is

well settled  that cases have to be decided  on merit

rather than on technicalities. It  has lastly  been

contended that the petitioners had filed an application

for appropriate orders  seeking an adjournment due to

his personal engagements but this request  has not been

considered  by the trial Court who has passed a harsh

order for closing  down  the right  of petitioners.

3. 

4. 

Arguments  heard, record perused.

Perusal  of record  reveals  that respondents No.1

& 2 have  filed suit for recovery  of maintenance,  dower

and dowry  articles which has been contested  by the

present  petitioners and learned Judge  Family Court

framed  the issues vide order dated 30.05.2019, where-

after the case was fixed for recording  of evidence for

19.06.2019  and plaintrtfsf  respondents  were  given last

opportunity for submission  of evidence for 08.07.2019

but on the said date again adjournment  has been

claimed,  therefore, absolute last opportunity  was

granted for 1.6.07.2019  and on the said date evidence  of

respondent  was submitted  by way of affidavit, however,

present petitioners being defendants  did not cross-

examine PW-1 and absolute last opportunity was

granted  subject to payment  of cost of Rs.1,000/-  and

matter  was adjourned to 24.07.2019,  however, learned

trial Court  has specifically written in her order that:-

Ll  cb Lq 0r Lgi 6{ / ;  v, -( wt"' / f  o?. LJ .t, o,A

-?Wtto,/{rve:f

But the present  petitioners  despite these  clear warnings

have not cross-examined  the witness  who was  present

on 24.07.2019  at about  10:30 a.m. with her counsel,

matter was adjourned to 12:00 p.m. then  01:30  p.m.  then

02:30  p.m. and at last about  03:15 p.m. but the present

petitioners  have not cross-examined  the PW-1 rather

W.P. No.373412019

3

filed an application  at 03:15 p.m. for adjournment.  This

conduct of the petitioners  amounts to willful defiance of

the Court  order which is otherwise, contemptuous

conduct and requires  no leniency,  even  otherwise,  the

term absolute  last opportunity  was referred  by the trial

Court in the previous order with cost of Rs.1,000/-,

therefore,  ample opportunity was granted  to the

petitioners  to cross-examine  the witness  but they  are

delaying  the matter, even otherwise, it is apparent  from

the record  that suit was filed on 1,4.11,.2018  and was

delayed due to non-appearance  of petitioners' side and

finally their appearance  was procured through

publication  of notice in the daity  Nawa-e-Waqat.

5. 

As per law the maximum  time period for

decision of the family case  is fixed in the Family Court

Act, 1964 which  could not be extended  beyond six

months, therefore,  Family Court has rightly imposed  the

cost with last warning to the petitioners'  side for the

early conclusion  of the trial, however, the conduct of the

petitioners  is not up to the mark.

6. 

It is trite law that interim  orders are not liable to

be challenged  in constitutional  jurisdiction  under  the

Family Court Act, 1964 and as such the legislature  has

intentionally not provided  any remedy  in the Family

Courts against the interim or interlocutory  orders. The

writ is not competent  against the interlocutory order

and such principle  has already  been highlighted  in the

reported cases
