for 

MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J:- Through the instant writ 

petition, 

the  petitioner/defendant,  Major  Anees-ur-Rehman, 

impugns  the judgment and  decree dated  22.01.2016, passed  by 

the  Court  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad, 

whereby respondent No.2/plaintiff’s appeal against the judgment 

and  decree  dated  30.11.2015,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court,  was  allowed.  Vide  the  said  judgment  and  decree 

dated  30.11.2015, 

the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  had 

dismissed respondent No.2’s claim for the recovery of 14 tolas of 

gold  ornaments  and  the remaining  dowry  articles.  Vide the  said 

appellate  judgment  and  decree,  the  learned  appellate  Court 

decreed  respondent  No.2’s  suit  to  the  extent  of  recovery  of  14 

tolas of gold ornaments as well as the remaining dowry articles.  

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  Mr.  M.  Hussain  Bhatti, 

Advocate,  was  briefly  heard.  Mr.  Jameel  Hussain  Qureshi, 

Advocate,  was  asked  to  assist  the  Court.  He  went  through  the 

case  file  and  submitted  that  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2 

got  married  on  18.02.2012;  that  the  couple  were  blessed  with  a 

son; that subsequently, the relations  between the petitioner and 

respondent  No.2  were  turned  sour  which  lead  to  their  divorce; 

that in the Nikahnama, 20 tolas of gold was mentioned as dower; 

that  07  tolas  of  gold  was  admittedly  given  by  the  petitioner  to 

respondent  No.2  at  the  time  of  marriage,  whereas  13  tolas  was 

deferred;  that  respondent  No.2  had  also  brought  along  dowry 

                
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
2 

W.P.No.2039/2016 

articles  with  her;  that  respondent  No.2  left  her  matrimonial 

abode on  her  own  account;  that  subsequently,  respondent No.2 

instituted  a  suit  for  the  recovery  of  dower  and  dowry  articles; 

that  the  petitioner,  with  good  intentions,  filed  an  application 

before the learned Family Court, wherein it was pleaded that the 

petitioner was willing to return respondent No.2’s dowry articles 

and  to  give  respondent  No.2  her  deferred  dower;  that  the  local 

commission  appointed  by 

the  Court  on 

the  petitioner’s 

application  reported 

that 

the  dowry  articles,  with  some 

discrepancies,  had  been  handed  over  to  respondent  No.2’s 

brother;  that  for  the  discrepancies  in  the  dowry  articles,  an 

amount  of  Rs.84,000/-  was  paid  by  the  petitioner  to  respondent 

No.2;  that  additionally,  the  petitioner  paid  an  amount  of 

Rs.4,00,000/-  plus  Rs.1,40,000/-  through  two  cheques  in  lieu  of 

the 13 tolas of gold i.e. deferred dower; that in total an amount of 

Rs.6,24,000/- was paid by the petitioner to respondent No.2; that 

no objections were filed  by respondent No.2 to the report of the 

local  commission;  that  respondent  No.2 

instead  of  being 

satisfied,  claimed  that  14  tolas  of  gold  in  the  shape  of  gold 

ornaments  had  not  been  given  by  the  petitioner  to  respondent 

No.2;  that  there  is  inconsistency  in  the  evidence  of  respondent 

No.2  (PW-1)  and  her  brother  (PW-2)  as  regards  the  receipt  of 

Rs.84,000/-;  that  since  the  report  of  the  local  commission  is  in 

consonance with the testimony of PW-2 as regards the payment 

of Rs.84,000/-, the evidence of PW-1 is rendered unreliable; that 

the  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court is strictly in accordance with the law and facts of the case; 

that  the  learned  appellate  Court  erred  by  not  appreciating  that 

on  account  of  the  handing  over  of  the  dowry  articles  and  an 

amount of  Rs.6,24,000/-,  the dispute  between  the petitioner  and 

respondent No.2  had  come to  an  end;  and  that  even  though  the 

petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  are  divorced,  respondent  No.2 

wants  to  harass  the  petitioner  and  embroil  him  in  unnecessary 

litigation.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  the  writ 

petition  to  be  allowed,  and  for  the  impugned  judgment  and 

decree dated 22.01.2016, to be set-aside.

W.P.No.2039/2016 

3. 

On  the  other  hand,  Mirza  Nabeel  Tahir,  Advocate,  learned 

counsel  for  respondent  No.2  submitted  that  respondent  No.2  in 

her  suit  as  well  as  her  evidence  had  taken  the  position  that  the 

petitioner  had  snatched  14  tolas  of  gold  ornaments  from 

respondent No.2 when she was turned  out from her matrimonial 

abode;  that  out  of  the  said  14 tolas  of  gold  ornaments,  07 tolas 

had  been  given  to  respondent  No.2  by  her  parents,  whereas  07 

tolas had been given to her as prompt dower by the petitioner at 

the  time  of  her  marriage;  that  respondent  No.2  had  not  been 

cross-examined on her deposition regarding the snatching of the 

said  gold  ornaments;  that  14  tolas  of  gold  had  been  snatched 

from her; that although the petitioner paid Rs.5,40,000/- in lieu of 

13  tolas  of  gold  (deferred  dower)  to  respondent  No.2,  but  14 

tolas  have  never  been  paid;  that  an  amount  of  Rs.84,000/-  was 

not paid  by  the petitioner  to  respondent No.2;  that  the report of 

the  local  commission  regarding  the  payment  of  Rs.84,000/-  is 

erroneous; 

that 

the 

list  of  dowry  articles  submitted  by 

respondent  No.2  cannot  be  doubted;  that  petitioner  had  also 

submitted a list of dowery articles which, he admitted, was in his 

possession; that the said list included a gold Madrasi set, a pearl 

gold  set,  gold  rings  and  bangles  etc.;  and  that  the  appellate 

judgment and decree is accordance with the law and facts of the 

case.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2  prayed  for  the  writ 

petition to be dismissed. 

4. 

I have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the 

contesting  parties,  and  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance. 

5. 

The record shows that  the petitioner  and respondent No.2 

got married on 18.02.2012. The couple were blessed with a son. 

As  per  the  Nikahnama,  the  dower  was  20  tolas  of  gold  out  of 

which 07 tolas was given at the time of the marriage, whereas 13 

tolas  was  deferred.  This  is  an  admitted  position.  Subsequently, 

the  relations  between  the  couple  turned  sour  causing  the 

petitioner to divorce respondent No.2.  

6. 

On  25.06.2014,  respondent  No.2  instituted  a  suit  for  the 

recovery  of  dower  and  dowry  articles  against  the  petitioner 

 
 
 
4 

W.P.No.2039/2016 

before  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad.  Respondent 

No.2,  in  her  suit  inter-alia  pleaded  that  13  tolas  of  deferred 

dower  had  not  been  given  to  her.  It  was  also  pleaded  that  on 

01.11.2013,  the  petitioner  threw  out  respondent  No.2  from  her 

matrimonial  abode  and  snatched  the  7 tolas of  gold  ornaments 

given  to  her  by  her  parents,  and  the  7  tolas  of  gold  ornaments 

given to her by the petitioner as prompt dowar at the time of her 

marriage. 

7. 

The  petitioner  contested  the  said  suit  by  filing  a  written 

statement.  From  the  divergent  pleadings  of  the  contested 

parties,  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  on  23.09.2015,  framed 

the following issues:- 

“1  Whether the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of dower in 
shape of gold ornaments weighting of 27 tolas? OPP 
2.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled for recovery of dowry 

articles as per list annexed with plaint? OPP 

3  Whether the plaintiff comes to the court with clean hand? 

OPD 

4  Relief.” 

8. 

Respondent  No.2  had  filed  a  list  of  dowry  articles,  which 

she  claimed  were  in  the  petitioner’s  possession.  Some  of  the 

items in this list were one Madrasi gold set, one white pearl gold 

set,  one  ring,  gold  earrings,  four  bangles,  etc.  It  may  be 

mentioned  that  the  petitioner  had  also  submitted  a  list  of 

respondent  No.2’s  dowry  articles  which  were  lying  with  the 

petitioner.  This  list  clearly  mentions  a  Madrasi  gold  set,  a  white 

pearl gold set, and an artificial jewelry set.  

9. 

On  15.01.2015,  the  petitioner  submitted  an  application  for 

the appointment of a local commission. In the said application, it 

was  pleaded  that  the petitioner  was  ready  to  return  respondent 

No.2’s  dowry  articles  in  accordance  with  the  said  list.  The 

petitioner  also  expressed  his  readiness  to  pay  the  deferred 

dower  i.e.  13  tolas  of  gold.  Mr.  Muhammad  Nadeem  Raja, 

Advocate,  the 

local  commission  appointed  by  the  Court, 

submitted  his  report  on  08.06.2015.  As  per  the  said  report, 

possession of the dowry articles (as per the list submitted before 

the  Court,  with  some  discrepancies)  was  given  to  respondent 

No.2’s brother. In lieu of the 13 tolas of gold (deferred dower), an 

 
 
 
 
5 

W.P.No.2039/2016 

amount  of  Rs.5,40,000/-  was  paid  by  the  petitioner  through  two 

cheques. In addition to the said amount, Rs.84,000/- was paid in 

cash by the petitioner. In this way, a total amount of Rs.6,24,000/- 

was  paid  by  the  petitioner  to  respondent  No.2.  No  objections 

were filed to the report of the local commission.  

10.  Respondent No.2 entered the witness box as PW-1 and filed 

her affidavit-in-evidence. The position taken by respondent No.1 

in the said affidavit was in consonance with the one taken in her 

suit.  Respondent  No.2 

in  her  affidavit-in-evidence  clearly 

deposed that 14 tolas of gold ornaments were snatched from her 

when  she  was  turned  out 

from  her  matrimonial  abode. 

Respondent  No.2  has  not  been  cross-examined  on  the  question 

as  to  whether  14  tolas  of  gold  ornaments  were  snatched  from 

her.  

11.  During  her  cross-examination,  respondent  No.2/PW-1 

admitted  that  her  dower  was  20  tolas  of  gold,  out  of  which  07 

tolas  was  given  to  her  at  the  time  of  the  marriage.  She  also 

admitted having taken the value of 13 tolas of gold in the form of 

cash from the petitioner. She also admitted receipt of most of the 

dowry  articles.  Respondent  No.2’s  brother,  Aimal  Khan  gave 

evidence  as  PW-2.  In  his  cross-examination,  PW-2  admitted 

having received Rs.6,24,000/- from the petitioner. Out of the said 

amount, Rs.84,000/- was said to have been paid in cash and the 

rest through two cheques. 

12.  There  is  a  glaring  discrepancy  in  the  testimonies  of  PW-1 

and  PW-2.  PW-1  denies  receiving  Rs.84,000/-,  whereas  PW-2 

(who is PW-1’s brother) admits having received Rs.84,000/- from 

the petitioner.  In  the  report  of  the local  commission,  it is  clearly 

mentioned that Rs.84,000/- was given in cash by the petitioner to 

respondent No.2/PW-1’s  brother.  Since respondent No.2  did  not 

file  any  objections  to  the  report  of  the  local  commission,  I  have 

no reason to fault the findings of the learned Judge Family Court 

that  as  per  the  report  of  the  local  commission,  Rs.84,000/-  was 

paid in cash in lieu of the discrepancies in the dowry articles.  

13.  The petitioner’s bonafides deserve recognition because he 

had  filed  an  application  before  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

 
 
 
6 

W.P.No.2039/2016 

in  which  he  had  expressed  his  willingness  to  return  respondent 

No.2’s dowry articles, and to pay the deferred dower of 13 tolas 

of gold. It is on the petitioner’s application that the learned Judge 

Family  Court,  had  appointed  a  local  commission.  Although  the 

report of the local commission does not  exhaustively list out the 

dowry  articles  received  by  respondent  No.2’s  brother  on 

respondent No.2’s behalf, it does mention the fact that the dowry 

articles  as  per  the  list  (with  some  discrepancies)  were  handed 

over  to  respondent  No.2’s  brother.  In  the  said  report,  it  is  also 

mentioned  that  two  cheques  for  Rs.1,40,000/-  and  Rs.4,00,000/- 

were  given  to  respondent  No.2’s  brother  in  lieu  of  13  tolas  of 

gold  i.e.  deferred  dower.  In  addition  to  the  said  amount, 

Rs.84,000/-  was  paid  in  cash.  Respondent  No.2  denies  having 

received  the  said  Rs.84,000/-.  When  the  report  of  the  local 

commission  is  read  along  with  the  cross-examination  of  PW-2 

(respondent No.2’s brother, who admitted the receipt of the said 

Rs.84,000/-),  respondent  No.2’s  testimony  becomes  unreliable. 

As mentioned above, respondent No.2 did not file any objections 

to the report of the local commission. 

14.  Respondent No.2, in her evidence did not describe the gold 

ornaments  which  were  “snatched”  from  her  by  the  petitioner. 

She  did  not  even  produce  the  receipts  of  the  07  tolas  of  gold 

ornaments which she claims her parents had given her. I cannot 

bring  myself  to  agree  with  the  findings  of  the  learned  appellate 

Court  that  simply  because  no  payment  had  been  made  by  the 

petitioner for the 07 tolas of gold ornaments, the allegation as to 

the  snatching  of  the  gold  ornaments  stood  proved.  Even  if  it  is 

assumed  that  the  gold  ornaments  were  snatched  by  the 

petitioner from respondent No.2, the fact remains that according 

to  the  report  of  the  local  commission  the  dowery  articles  (with 

some  discrepancies)  were  returned  by  the  petitioner  to 

respondent  No.2,  through  her  brother.  These  dowery  articles 

included  the  gold  ornaments  mentioned  in  the  list  submitted  by 

the petitioner as well as the list submitted by respondent No.2. In 

the  report  of  the  local  commission,  it  is  not  mentioned  that  the 

“discrepancies” were related to the gold ornaments. In lieu of the 

 
 
 
7 

W.P.No.2039/2016 

discrepancies,  Rs.84,000/-  had  been  paid  by  the petitioner.  Had 

the  “discrepancies”  in  the  dowry  articles  handed  over  by  the 

petitioner  been  referable  to  the  gold  ornaments,  respondent 

No.2  would  have  certainly  filed  objections  to  the  report  of  the 

local  commission.  Since  respondent  No.2  had  not  taken  any 

objection to the report of the local commission, and this very fact 

disentitles  respondent  No.2  to  assert  that  she  had  not  received 

the  gold  ornaments  mentioned  in  the  list  of  the  dowry  articles. 

Therefore,  I  am  of  the  view  that  the  learned  appellate  Court 

misread the evidence on the record.  

15. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  appeal  is  allowed.  The 

impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated  22.01.2016,  is  set-aside, 

and  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  30.11.2015,  is  restored. 

There shall be no order as to costs.
