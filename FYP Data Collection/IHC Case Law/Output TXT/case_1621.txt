Haseeb Abbas and Aliiya Batoo!  (hereinafter

referred to as 'Minorc). The Petitioner  was

gainfully  employed  in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia. The parties developed  marita!
differences which led to divorce that took

effect on 29-03-2016.  Respondent  filed a suit
on  22-04-20L5 seeking recovery  of

maintenance  for herself and the minors.  The

learned Judge Family Court partially  decreed

the suit vide judgment and decree, dated

22-04-20t9. The petitioner  preferred an

appeal and the same was dismissed by the

learned Additional  District Judge (West),

Islamabad  vide judgment and decree,  dated

t7-02-2020.

3. 

The learned counsel has been

heard at length.  He has argued that; both the
learned courts failed to take the relevant

matters  into consideration;  the concurrent

findings suffer from misreading  and non-
reading; the Petitioner  is facing  financial
is not in the

problems and, therefore,  hâ‚¬ 

position to pay for the maintenance amount

determined by the learned trial Court; the

Petitioner has serious medical problems and,

therefore, which prevents him from being

gainfully  employed.

The learned counse! has been

heard at length and the record has been

perused  with his able assistance.

5. 

It is an admitted position  that the

Petitioner  and Respondent  had entered into a

marriage  contract and out of which the Minors

were born. The Petitioner is father of the

Minors and his obligations towards  them

stands admitted. It is also not disputed that at

the time when the suit was filed the Petitioner
was gainfully employed. It appears  from the

record that the Petitioner despite  being

gainfully employed was reluctant  to fulfill his

obligations towards the Minors. Both the

courts have concurrently recorded  findings

which have not been found to suffer from any

legal infirmity let alone misreading and non-

reading. The findings are reasonable  and do

not require interference while exercising
jurisdiction under Article 199 of  the
Constitution of  the Islamic Republic of

Pakistan, L973.

For the above reasons,  the

petition is devoid of merits and, therefore,

accordingly  disrTrissed  in limine.
