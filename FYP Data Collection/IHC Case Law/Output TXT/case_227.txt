21.12.2022  Mr. Aftab Ahmed, Advocate for the petitioner  

Sardar Najeeb ur Rehman, Advocate for the respondents 

Learned counsel for the respondents urges this Court to follow 2012 

CLC 24 holding that the citizens of AJK can approach the family courts in 

Pakistan,  when  2017  YLR  84,  a  judgement  of  this  Court,  holds  to  the 

contrary.  While I am inclined to follow the view in the latter judgement, it 

is only fair that learned counsel for the respondents be given a fair chance 

to plead his case.  He is allowed to do so, subject to the undertaking, which 

he  has  extended  today  in  Court,  that  his  clients  will  not  pursue  the 

succession proceedings until the decision in this case is rendered.

Relist on 23.01.2023.
