MAIN CASE. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI  J.  Through  the 

instant  civil  revision,  the  petitioners 

father  have 

assailed  the  concurrent  findings of the  Courts  below, 

whereby  suit  for  declaration,  specific  performance, 

2 

Civil Revision  No.  114/2013 

permanent  and  mandatory  injunction  of  agreement 

dated  05.01.1994 

referred  as  Exh.Pl  has  been 

dismissed 

vide 

judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

24.05.2011,  passed  by learned  Civil Judge,  1st  Class, 

Islamabad  and  the  same  has  been  maintained  by 

learned  Additional District  Judge  (West), Islamabad 

vide judgment  and  decree dated  15.01.2013. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  contends 

that 

father  of  the  petitioners  has  entered 

into 

agreement  dated  05.01.1994  Exh.Pl 

to  purchase 

property  i.e.  Unit No. 4  comprising  of basement,  one 

shop,  veranda,  one bath  and  Flat  without  roof against 

the  total  sale consideration  of Rs. 725,000/-.  However, 

he  had  paid  Rs.600,000/- 

through  pay  order  and 

Rs.100,000/- 

in  cash  at  the  time  of  execution  of 

agreement  and  Rs.25,000 /-  was  left, which  was  to be 

paid  at  the  time of transfer  of the  property.  He further 

contends 

that 

the  defendant  has  been  proceeded 

against  ex-parte  and  he  had  produced  two witnesses 

alongwith his  own testimony  to prove his  case,  even he 

has  produced 

the  sale  deed  Exh.P2,  which  was 

executed  by  two of the  sellers  for their  share,  except 

Muhammad  Mushtaq/respondent  No.1 and  as  such 

the  entire  agreement  of sale  consideration  and  transfer 

of part  of property  including  complete  possession  has 

been  admitted  by  the  defendant  side  by  his  implied 

conduct,  but  all 

these  aspects  have  not  been 

considered  by  the  learned  Trial Court  as  well as  by 

learned  First  Appellate  Court. 

It  has 

lastly  been 

3 

Civil Revision No. 114/2013 

contended  that  the  Courts  below have  misread  the 

entire  evidence. 

3. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel 

for  respondent 

No.2 / CDA contends  that  petitioners  have  failed  to 

discharge  their  onus  to  prove  the  contents  of  the 

agreement  under  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984, 

therefore,  their  suit  has  rightly  been  dismissed  by the 

Courts  below. 

4. 

This  Court  has  issued  notices  to  respondent 

No.1 

through 

substituted  mode  of  service  by 

publication  in  Daily Pakistan  dated  09.04.2020  and 

office has  appended  the  newspaper  Daily Pakistan, 

which  includes  the  publication  of the  notices  in  the 

name  of respondent  No. l,  however, no  one  has  put 

appearance  on his  behalf, hence,  respondent  No.1 has 

been proceeded against  ex-parte. 

5.  Arguments  heard  and  record perused. 

6. 

Perusal  of record  reveals  that  the  father  of the 

petitioners  entered  into an  agreement  with  respondent 

No. l  Exh.Pl  dated  05.01.1994 

to  purchase 

suit 

property  i.e.  Unit No. 4  comprising  of basement,  one 

shop,  veranda,  one bath  and  Flat  without  roof against 

the  total  sale  consideration  of  Rs.  725,000 /-.  The 

agreement  was  executed  with  three  parties  namely 

Abdul  Rasheed,  Khawaja  Shakeel  Ahmed  and 

Muhammad  Mushtaq/ respondent  No. l,  who  were 

owner of the  suit  property,  however, the  property  was 

not  transferred  in the  name  of father  of the  petitioners, 

who  was  constrained  to  file  a  suit  on  06.12.2004, 

however,  respondent  No.1  has  been  proceeded 

4 

Civil Revision No. 114/2013 

ex-parte,  whereafter  the  petitioner/Malik  Abdul Aziz 

has  recorded  his  ex-parte  evidence in  shape  of three 

witnesses  including himself. 

7. 

The petitioner  in  order  to  prove his  case  and  to 

discharge  his  onus  in  terms  of  Article  11 7  of  the 

Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984  has  produced  Malik 

Asif Aziz/PW-2, his  real  son, who is not  witness  of the 

said  agreement,  similarly, he  has  also  produced  Raja 

Muhammad  Hanif/PW-3,  who  is  stated 

to  be  the 

nominee  of the  petitioner/Malik  Abdul Aziz being an 

actual  transferee,  even he  was  not  the  witness  in  the 

said  agreement. 

8. 

The 

entire 

record 

reflects 

that 

the 

petitioner /Malik  Abdul Aziz has  produced  Exh.P2  a 

sale  deed  of  the  suit  property,  whereby  two  of  the 

sellers  have  transferred 

their  shares  from  a  joint 

property  vide  registered  sale  deed  No.  3236  dated 

10.07.2004  referred  as  Exh.P2,  but  this  does  not 

absolve the  petitioner  to independently  prove the  entire 

case  as  required  in terms  of Article 17 read  with Article 

79  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984, whereby  it  is 

the  obligation of the  petitioner  to  discharge  the  onus, 

especially  where  entire  suit  was  based  upon 

the 

agreement  to sell, which requires  to be proved through 

contents  as  well as  its  execution  in  an  independent 

manner,  which  is  lacking  in  this  case,  therefore,  this 

Court  is  fortified with  the  view taken  in  the  case  law 

reported  as  1999  SC.HR  2004 

(Ghulam  Rasul 

represented  by  Legal  Heirs  VS  Muhammad 

5 

Civil Revision No. 114/2013 

Hussain  and  4  others} and  PLD  2019  Islamabad 

406  {Arif-uz-Zaman VS Mst. Sabir  Jan  and  others}. 

9. 

It  has  also been  observed  that  the  agreement  as 

well  as  its  contents  have  not  been  proved  by  the 

petitioner,  even  suit  was  filed with  delay  of  10  long 

years  without  valid 

justification,  whereby 

the 

limitation  period provided for  specific performance  is 

three  (03) years,  which has  also not  been  adhered  to in 

a proper  manner. 

10.  For what  has  been  discussed  above, instant  civil 

revision 

is  misconceived  and 

same 

is  here by 

DISMISSED.
