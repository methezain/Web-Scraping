Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

Malik Talat Hussain, Advocate for petitioner.  
Mr. Majid Rashid Khan, Advocate for respondents. 

Through the instant petition, the petitioner has assailed the judgment 

and decree dated 04.12.2019 as well as order and decree dated 30.10.2019 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (East),  Islamabad  and 

Judge Family Court (East), Islamabad respectively. 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  contended  that  the  financial  position  of  the 

petitioner  was  not  considered  while  passing  the  impugned  orders  despite 

the  fact  that  the  petitioner  in  compliance  of  the  order  of  the  learned  trial 

Court  has  deposited  an  amount  of  Rs.  1  lac  at  different  times  in  the  trial 

Court and requested the Court to decrease the monthly maintenance, as he 

is not in a position to pay Rs. 12000/- to each minor per month.   

3. 

The  learned  counsel  further  contended  that  vide  order  dated 

30.10.2019  instead  of  considering  the  request  of  the  petitioner  for 

decreasing  the maintenance of the minors, the trial Court has unjustifiable 

enhanced the  maintenance for Rs. 12,000/- to 20,000/- for each minor per 

month from the date of institution of the suit till their legal entitlement with 

10%  annual  increase  and  the  right  of  defence  of  the  petitioner  was  also 

struck  of  under  section  17-A  of  the  Family  Court  Act,  1964.  He  further 

contended  that  the  petitioner  preferred  the  appeal  against  the  order  dated 

30.10.2019 and the same was also dismissed vide order dated 04.12.2019. 

4. 

The learned counsel states that the petitioner is running a small shop 

of  silver  in  village  Kharian  Wala  and  his  monthly  income  is  about  Rs. 

15,000/-  to  16,000/-  and  the  petitioner  is  also  looking  after  two  children

from first wife. He further stated that the respondent No. 3 has prepared a 

bogus and fabricated school admission form which is annexed with the suit, 

wherein  monthly income of the petitioner has been shown as Rs. 30,000/- 

per month. 

5. 

The  instant  matter  was  taken  up  on  20.01.2020  by  this  Court  and 

notices  were  issued  to  the  respondents  No.  3  to  5,  whereafter  learned 

counsel for the respondent appeared and contested the matter on merits as 

well as on factual grounds. 

6. 

Today the matter was taken up, the learned counsel for the petitioner 

stated  that vide  order  dated 02.12.2021 the  suit  filed by the petitioner has 

been dismissed due to non-prosecution. 

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  has  placed  on  record  execution 

application  filed  by  the  respondent  for  execution  of  the  decree  dated 

30.10.2019. The learned counsel for the petitioner stated that he is unaware 

of the proceedings of execution.  

8. 

Since the suit is no more pending before the learned trial Court and 

the respondent has filed execution  of decree dated 30.10.2019 and notices 

have  been  issued  to  the  petitioner,  therefore,  the  instant  writ  petition 

become  infructuous.  The  petitioner  may  avail  remedy  before  appropriate 

forum.  

9. 

In view of above, instant writ petition stand disposed of.
