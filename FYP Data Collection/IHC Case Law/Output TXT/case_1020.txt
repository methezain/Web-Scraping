12-11-2021.  Mr.  Muhammad  Atif  Farzauq  Raja,  Advocate 

for the petitioner.  

  Through  this  petition  the  judgment  and 

decree  dated  16-10-2020  passed  by  the 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Islamabad  (East) 

has  been  impugned  as  well  as  the  judgment 

and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Additional 

District Judge dated 02.04.2021.  

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submitted  that  the  petitioners  are  aggrieved 

by the amount of maintenance fixed in favour 

of  respondent  No.3,  the  former  wife  of  the 

petitioner,  and  respondent  No.4,  the  minor 

daughter of the petitioner No.1. He submitted 

that  respondent  No.3  was  a  working  woman 

and the courts ought to have appreciated that 

she had means to support herself. And further 

that  the  maintenance  ought  not  have  been 

granted  to  respondent  No.3  for  the  entire 

period of subsistence of marriage. The learned 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.       W.P No. 4010/2021 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  stated  that  the 

interim  maintenance  for  the  minor  daughter 

was  fixed  as  Rs.8000/-,  and  in  the  judgment 

and  decree  it  has  been  fixed  as  Rs.20,000/-, 

without  provided  a  basis  for  enhancing  the 

maintenance. He submitted that there was no 

evidence  adduced  by  the  respondents  to 

establish the income of the petitioner and that 

the  petitioner  had  made  a  suggestion  during 

cross-examination 

of 

the 

respondent 

witnesses  that  the  petitioner  did  not  earn  an 

amount  of  50,000  Dirham,  as  claimed  by  the 

respondent  No.3.  That  the  learned  Family 

Court  erred  in  concluding  that  the  petitioner 

was a person of means.   

3. 

  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has failed to establish any misreading or non-

reading of evidence. He has failed  to identify 

any  material  on  record  adduced  in  evidence 

before  the  learned  Family  Court  establishing 

that  the  petitioner’s  income  was  meager  and 

that  he  was  unable  to  pay  Rs.20,000/-  per 

month  to  maintain  his  minor  daughter.  The 

petitioner’s  case  is  that  he  is  ready  and 

willing to maintain his daughter, but has been 

unable to convince the Court that the learned 

Family  Court  has  erred  in  exercising  its 

discretion  while  affixing  the  quantum  of 

 
3.       W.P No. 4010/2021 

maintenance.  The  amount  fixed  reflects  that 

the  learned  Family  Court  did  not  conclude 

that the petitioner earned 50,000 Dirham per 

month.  He has also been unable to point out 

any  provision  of  the  statute  or  any  case  law 

which  states 

that  a  husband 

is  not 

responsible  for  maintaining  his  wife  in  the 

event that the wife is a working woman. The 

learned  counsel  has  failed  to  identify  any 

infirmity  in  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  of  the  learned  Family  Court  and  the 

learned appellate court.    

4. 

  For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  this  petition 

is without merit and is dismissed in limine.  

Saeed.
