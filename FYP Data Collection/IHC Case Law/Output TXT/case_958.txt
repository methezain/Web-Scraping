Proceedings 

                   03.12.2021. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary. 
Mr.  Jameel  Hussain  Qureshi,  advocate  for  the 
petitioner.  

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner,  Yasmeen  Bibi, 

impugns 

the 

consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated 

02.10.2021  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned 

Additional 

District 

Judge, 

Islamabad, whereby the petitionerâ€™s appeal 

against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 

12.07.2021,  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, was 

dismissed.    

Learned counsel for the petitioner drew 

the  attention  of  the  Court  to  entry  No.17  in 

the  Nikahnama according  to  which,  upon 

pronouncement  of  divorce,  respondent 

No.1  was 

liable  to  pay  an  amount  of 

Rs.500,000/-  to  the  petitioner.  Learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that 

the  said  provision  in  the  Nikahnama  has 

been  declared  as  unlawful  by  the  learned 

trial Court; that the learned appellate Court 

erred 

inasmuch  as 

the  payment  of 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rs.500,000/-  was  not  a  condition  for  a 

divorce,  but  upon  the  divorce  having  been 

pronounced, 

the  said  amount  would 

become due and payable to the petitioner.   

Issue notice to respondent No.1. 

Relist. 

C.M. No.01/2021 

Exemption  sought 

for 

is  allowed, 

subject to all just and legal exceptions.
