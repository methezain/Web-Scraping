Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel where necessary.  

21.10.2022  Mr.  Nasir  Mehmood,  Advocate  counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the  petitioner 

has  assailed  the  order  dated  19.04.2018  passed  by  the 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Family  Court-East, 

Islamabad whereby the suit for recovery of dower and 

maintenance  filed  by  the  petitioner  was  dismissed  to 

the  extent  of  dower  and  appeal  filed  against  the  said 

order  also  met  the  same  fate  vide  order  dated 

30.05.2018. 

 Learned  counsel  stated  that  vide  impugned 

order, observations made with regard to issue No.3 are  

misconceived  and  Trial  Court  has  erred  while  holding 

that  in  the  column  No.16  of  the  Nikah  Nama,  the 

description  of 

the  property  was  not  properly 

mentioned.  Thus  the  only  point  was  discussed  while 

discarding  the  rest  of  evidence  produced  by  the 

petitioner.
