Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or
counsel where necessary.

Date of

Proceedings
24.09.2021. Mr. Khalique Siddiqui, Advocate for petitioner.

Through this writ petition the petitioner has

assailed  the  O.M dated  14.09.2021,  issued  by  ZTBL

authorities, whereby petitioner has been transferred

and  placed  at  the  disposal  of  Zonal  Chief,  ZTBL,

Bahawalnagar.

2.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner inter-alia

contends  that  petitioner is  performing  his  duties

with  zeal  and  commitment  since  his  date  of

appointment  i.e.  22.10.1999  and  at  present  he  has

served 33 years in this department and is at verge of

retirement;  that  petitionerâ€™s  family  is  permanently

settled in Islamabad and as such he is also looking-

after  his  old ailing mother,  which  is  dependent

upon  him;  that  petitioner  has  continuously  been

transferred 

from  one  office 

to  other  within

headquarters  during  his  service,  therefore,  he  is

exposed  to  extreme  hardships,  if  the  impugned

W.P. No.3390/2021

2

order is not set aside.

3.

4.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  petitioner  is

primarily  aggrieved  with  his 

transfer  order,

whereby his service has been placed at the disposal

of  Zonal  Chief,  ZTBL,  Bahawalnagar  with

immediate effect.  The  order  impugned  before  this

court relates to terms & conditions of service of the

petitioner  and  as  such  it  is  the  sole  prerogative  of

the  employer  to transfer his  employee  at  any

suitable place as the employer likes, who is the best

judge  to  settle  this  issue  on  the  basis  of  its  own

internal policy and requirements. An employee has

no  right  to  dictate  the  employer  in  any  manner  for

placement  of  his  service  at  any  place  of  his  choice.

Reliance 

is  placed  upon 1998  SCMR  1293

(Muhammad  Shafique  Tareen  VS  WAPDA),  2006

SCMR  443 

(Government  of  Punjab 

through

Secretary,  Labor  and  Manpower,  Civil  Secretariat

and  others  VS  Shahid  Mehmood  Butt). Moreover,

the  posting  order  cannot  be  challenged  unless  it  is

against  the  law  and  rules  or  it  is  based  upon

malafide, as such petitioner has not highlighted any

malafide on the  part  of  employer,  nor  pointed  out

any illegality in the impugned order, even conceded

to  this  effect  that  it  is  the  right  and  prerogative  of

W.P. No.3390/2021

3

the  employer  to  post  out  the  petitioner  at  any

suitable place.

5.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  been

confronted  regarding  internal  status  of  ZTBL  at

Bahawalnagar, whereby he contends that ZTBL has

administrative  setup  in  different  areas  of  Pakistan

and  as  such  petitioner  has  been  placed  at  the

disposal of Zonal Chief, ZTBL, Bahawalnagar.

6.

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ  petition  is

misconceived  and  the  same is  hereby dismissed  in

limine.
