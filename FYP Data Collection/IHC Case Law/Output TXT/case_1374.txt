Mst. Maryam Khan, etc.

Order with signatures of judge, and that of 
parties of counsel, where necessary.

     04.03.2021   Nemo for the petitioner, 

Ch. M. Awais Advocate for respondents 1 to 3. 

Called  repeatedly  but  nobody  entered 

appearance on behalf of the petitioner. 

Learned  counsel  in-attendance  apprised 

that WP No. 3742 of 2020 titled “Kamran 

Khan  v.  Mst.  Maryam  Khan  &  4  others” 

assailing  final  decree  in  the  subject  case  has 

been  allowed  and 

consequent 

thereto 

petitioner was allowed to join and contest the 

suit.  In  this  view  of  the  matter,  instant  writ 

petition  assailing 

interlocutory  order  qua 

fixation  of  interim  maintenance  has  lost  its 

efficacy and has become redundant. 

Perhaps 

for  above  reason,  nobody 

entered  appearance  from  petitioner’s  side. 

Dismissed for non prosecution.  

AR.ANSARI.*
