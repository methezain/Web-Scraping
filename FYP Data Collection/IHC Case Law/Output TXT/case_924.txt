Main Case 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the  petitioner 

has  challenged  order  dated  21.10.2021,  passed  by 

respondent  No.5,  whereby  the  learned  Trial  Court 

has  fixed  monthly  maintenance  of  Rs.15,000/-  per 

child. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  inter  alia, 

contended that the amount of Rs.15,000/- per month 

per child as ad-interim maintenance is on the higher 

side  and  the  same  be  reduced.  It  was  contended 

that the impugned order is not based on  any record 

or justification. In support of his contention, learned 

counsel  placed  reliance  on  case  reported  as  Ali 

Adnan Dar VSJudge Family Court and others 

(PLD 2016 Lahore 73).
