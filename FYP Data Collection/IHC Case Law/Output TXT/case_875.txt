Date of Decision:

29.12.2021.

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J: Through this  writ  petition, the

petitioner has  called  in  question  judgment  and  decree  of  the  learned

Additional District Judge-IX (West), Islamabad, dated 18.03.2019, whereby

appeal  filed  by  the  petitioner  against  the judgment  and  decree  of  the

dismissed.

2.

Succinctly, Sajjad Hussain (petitioner) and Rubab Khan (respondent

No.3) tied the knot on 06.06.2005, but the marital relationship between the

spouses became  strained,  as  a  result  whereof,  respondent  No.3  left  the

abode  of  the  petitioner and  filed  a  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  before

the  District  Courts,  Sargodha,  which  was  dismissed  vide  judgment  and

decree  dated  22.01.2007.  Later  on,  respondent  No.3  again  filed  a  suit in

Islamabad for  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of Khula  as  well  as

recovery of past maintenance allowance, dower amount of Rs.48,000/- and

other  dowry  articles,  as  such,  the  petitioner  contested  the  suit,  but  same

was  partially  decreed  vide  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated

15.11.2018.  Feeling  aggrieved  thereof  the  petitioner  preferred  an  appeal,

which  was  dismissed  vide  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated

18.03.2019. Hence, instant writ petition.

3.

Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  contends  that respondent  No.3

concealed  material  facts  from  the  Courts  and  deliberately  not  disclosed

about  filing  of  her  earlier  suit  in  Sargodha,  which  was  dismissed,

whereafter she with malafide filed another suit in Islamabad despite being

resident  of  Sargodha,  as  such,  both  the  Courts  below  have  not  properly

appreciated  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case,  rather  resorted  to

passing of the impugned judgments and decrees in a haste, which resulted

into  grave injustice  to  the  petitioner. Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner

further contends that both the courts below have not appreciated the legal

and  factual  aspect  that  respondent  No.3  decree  holder  has  filed  the  suit

before  the  Family  court  without  claim  of  jewelry,  gold  ornaments  rather

only  dowry  articles  were  claimed  on  the  basis  of  list  attached  with  plaint

but the courts below have awarded the decree of gold ornaments contrary

to the record.

5.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  since  admission  of  the  instant writ

petition  on  04.12.2019,  notices  were  issued  to  respondent  No.3  on

04.12.2019,

31.01.2020,  16.08.2021,  06.10.2021  and  24.11.2021,  but

respondent  No.3  never  put  appearance  before  this  Court,  as  a  result

whereof,  respondent  No.3  was  proceeded  ex-parte  vide  order  dated

17.12.2021.

6.

It  has  further  been  observed  from  the  record  that respondent  No.3

filed  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of  khulla,  suit  for

recovery  of  past  maintenance,  recovery  of  dower  amount  and  dowry

articles  against  the  petitioner  which  was  partially  decreed  in  her  favour

and  maintained  by  the  appellate  court,  as  such  instant  writ  petition  is

against  the  concurrent  findings.  The  petitioner  has  only  argued  and

confines his case to the extent of jewelry which was awarded by the courts

below to respondent No.3 on a single ground that jewelry was not part of

the claim.

7.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  been  confronted  qua  the

evidence  recorded  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  whereby  Ex.P-3  list  of

dowry articles was exhibited on record which contains details of jewelry at

S.No.6 in the following manner:-

8.

The  petitioner  contends  that  this  part of  jewelry  should  have  been

claimed  separately  in  the  prayer  as  it  is  not  part  of  dowry  articles  but

surprisingly  the  petitioner  has  not  suggested  anything  to  the  witness  of

respondent  No.3  qua  the  said  jewelry,  nor  it  is  the  case  of  petitioner  that

the  list  was  tampered  or  subsequently  tampered  in  the  court,  in  such

scenario  when  dowry  articles  list  Ex.P-3  is  available  on  record  and

exhibited  any  objection  on  the  veracity  of  said  list  at  this  stage  in

constitutional jurisdiction is not permissible. Even otherwise, courts below

have rightly considered the jewelry in terms of list Ex.P-3 and awarded the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2566/2019

claim  to  respondent  No.3  after  appreciating  the  evidence  on  record.  As

such  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  in  the  concurrent

findings,  which are within  four  corners  of  law,  therefore,  instant  writ

petition is misconceived and the same is hereby dismissed.
