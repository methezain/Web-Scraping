17.05.2022  M/s  Ch  Abdul  Majeed  and  Muhammad  Afzal  Siddique, 

Advocates for the petitioner.  

This  writ  petition  assails  the  appellate  order  dated 

23.11.2021 modifying the order dated 04.03.2020, whereby the 

petitioner  was  directed  to  pay  maintenance  allowance  of 

Rs.100,000/-  to  his  daughter  respondent  no.  3  without  the 

condition  of  living  with  the  father.    The  judgment  in  the  first 

instance  allowed  maintenance  of  Rs.50,000/-  on  the  condition 

that the daughter will live with her  father.   

2 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  states,  inter-alia, 

that the daughter was 37 years of age when the appellate order 

was  passed,  that  she  received  the  best  education  possible,  has 

good employment prospects, her refusal to stay with her father 

disentitles  her  to  maintenance,  and  learned  counsel  cites  PLD 

2009 SC 760 , 2011 YLR 1632 and 2006 CLC 1754 in support.   

3 

Admit.    Let  notice  be  issued  to  respondent  no.  3  for 

10.06.2022 to file her reply within 2 weeks from today.

petition.  For the reasons stated above, the impugned appellate
