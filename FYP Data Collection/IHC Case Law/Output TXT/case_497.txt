ARBAB MUHAMMAD TAHIR, J:  The instant writ petition is arising 

out  of  judgments  and  decrees  dated  27.06.2019  and  28.01.2020 

passed  by  the  Judge  Family  Court  and  the  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad 

(West) 

respectively,  whereby  suit 

for 

recovery  of 

maintenance allowance and dower amount filed by respondents 1 to 3 

were decreed and appeal against the above judgment and decree dated 

27.06.2019 was dismissed.  

2. 

Precisely, relevant facts are that on 08.10.2015 respondents 1 to 

3 namely Mst. Hajra Tariq, Makial Siraj Qazi and Salman Qazi filed suit 

for  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance  (past,  future  and  for  Iddat  period) 

besides  dower  amount  of  Rs.5,00,000/-.  Initially,  the  petitioner 

contested  the  suit  by  filing  written  statement  wherein  he  refuted  the 

claim  of  the  respondents,  however,  subsequently  disjoined  the 

proceedings  and  his  right  to  produce  evidence  was  closed  on 

11.07.2018.  The  learned  Trial  Court  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.06.2019  partially  decreed  the  suit  in  terms  that  respondent  No.1 

held  entitled  to  recover  maintenance  allowance  for  the  period  of  Iddat 

at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month, respondents 2 & 3 at the rate of 

Rs.25,000/-  per  month,  per  head  from  February  2015  till  legal 

entitlement  with  10%  annual  increase.  In  addition,  respondent  No.1 

also  held  entitled  to  recover  dower  amount  of  Rs.5,00,000/-.  Being 

dissatisfied  with  the  judgment  and  decree,  petitioner  filed  an  appeal, 

but  the  same  was  dismissed  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated 

28.01.2020, being impugned through the instant writ petition.  

 
 
2                                                        W.P. No.1040 of 2021 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argued  that  in  case  of 

misreading  of  evidence  and  where  the  concurrent  findings  are  against 

the  record,  the  jurisdiction  in  terms  of  Article  199  of  the  Constitution 

can  be  exercised;  that  the  maintenance  fixed  for  respondents  2  &  3 

does  not  cohere  with  the  financial  status  of  the  petitioner  as  the  very 

claim was based upon presumption qua earning of the petitioner as the 

respondent  No.1  asserted  that  petitioner  could  earn  Rs.300,000/-  per 

month,  and  that  petitioner  is  ready  to  pay  maintenance  as  per  his 

financial  capability  at  the  rate  of  Rs.15,000/-per  head  as  determined 

by the Trial Court as an interim maintenance of two minors, therefore, 

impugned  judgment  and  decrees  are  liable  to  be  modified.  Learned 

counsel placed reliance upon case laws reported as PLD 1978 Karachi 

417, 1984 PLC 95  (Peshawar), 1979  PLC 437 (Karachi)  and 1976 

PLC 01.  

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  1  to  3 

argued  that  the  petitioner,  being  real  father  is  under  obligation  to 

maintain his children irrespective of the fact that they are residing with 

their real mother; that the awarded maintenance is in accordance with 

financial  position  of  the  petitioner  and  that  the  conduct  demonstrated 

by the petitioner disentitles him to ask for discretionary relief as he had 

been  avoiding  to  appear  before  the  learned  Trial  Court  that  led  to 

closure of his right to adduce evidence, therefore, petition is liable to be 

dismissed.  

5. 

6. 

Heard, record perused.  

The  evidence  in  the  present  case  comprised  of  affidavit  of 

respondent  No.1  Ex.P,  copy  of  Nikah  Nama  Ex.P2,  certificate  of  Talaq 

Ex.P3,  Insurance  Policy  deposit  receipt  Ex.P4,  school  fee  payment 

receipts  Mark-A  &  Mark-B,  tuition  fee  receipt  Mark-B,    fee  receipt 

Mark-C,  receipt  regarding  minors’  expenses  Mark-D,  salary  slip  of 

respondent  No.1  Mark-E,  salary  and  service  certificate  of  respondent 

No.1 Mark-F & Mark-G. 

7. 

After  careful  perusal  of  the  pleadings  of  the  parties  and  the 

evidence referred to above, the admitted facts that glean out are to the 

effect  that  the  marriage  of  petitioner  and  respondent  No.1  was 

solemnized on 16.12.2002 and lasted for more than 13 years when the 

latter exercised her right to divorce on 26.03.2015. There is no dispute 

with  regard  to  the  extension  of  the  said  right  to  the  respondent  No.1 

 
 
3                                                        W.P. No.1040 of 2021 

while  the  dated  of  desertion  i.e.  12.02.2015  is  also  an  admitted  one. 

The  respondent  No.3  was  born  on  13.06.2007  while  respondent  No.2 

on  12.10.2013.  The  dower  amount  i.e.  Rs.500,000/-  is  also  an 

admitted fact while there is no evidence to substantiate the claim of the 

petitioner as asserted in written statement in para-2 parawise reply in 

terms that “the reality is that dower amount has been accordingly paid 

to  the  plaintiff  No.1  in  cash  in  the  beginning”.  Both  the  minors  are 

school  going  and  are  being  imparted  with  education  while  the  ex-

spouses are also in litigation over custody of the minors by claiming to 

have preferential right over the other.  

7. 

The  thrust  of  the  arguments  had  been  on  the  point  that  the 

maintenance  fixed  is  not  in  accordance  with  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner and it was also for the reason that the respondent No.1 had 

failed  to  discharge  her  onus  to  prove  the  financial  capability  of  the 

petitioner to nourish the two minors. 

8. 

It  is  settled  principle  that  the  minors  are  entitled  to  be 

maintained  by  the  father  in  the  manner  befitting  the  status  and 

financial condition of the father and for this reason, the Family Court is 

under an obligation while granting the maintenance allowance, to keep 

in  mind  the  financial  condition  and  status  of  the  father.  Reliance  is 

placed upon case of “Tauqeer Ahmad Qureshi v. Additional District 

Judge, Lahore and 2 others” (PLD 2009 SC 760). 

9. 

The  precedent  on  the  subject  is  the  case  of  “Nazia  Bibi  and 

others v. Additional District Judge,  Ferozewala and others” (PLD 

2018  Lahore  916)  wherein  the  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court  after 

surveying  the  case  law,  has  held  that  “for  the  determination  of  the 

quantum of  maintenance,  it  is  mandatory for the Court  to determine  the 

income  of  the  father  either  through  proper  documentary  evidence  or  on 

the basis of social status and earning capacity of the father.” 

10. 

In the present case, the evidence on record divulges that both the 

minors  are  school  going,  being  imparted  with  education  as  reveals 

through  receipts  Mark-A  (1-4)  and  Mark-B  while  on  the  aspect  of 

documentary  evidence  qua  financial  status  of  the  petitioner,  as  per 

stance  of  respondent  No.1  contained  in  Para-03  of  the  plaint,  take 

home salary of the petitioner was Rs.250,000/-, respondent reaffirmed 

her  stance  in  affidavit  Ex.  P1  which  the  petitioner  never  attempted  to 

deny  by  appearing  in  the  witness  box  or  subjecting  the  respondent 

 
 
4                                                        W.P. No.1040 of 2021 

No.1  to  cross  examination  rather  he  disjoined  in  the  midst  of  the 

proceedings.  In  addition,  the  social  status  and  earning  capacity  of  the 

petitioner can well be gathered from his own stance contained in Para-

11  of  the  written  statement  in  terms  that  “the  contents  of  Para  No.11 

are denied being incorrect. The facts have been already submitted above 

the defendant is balanced, groomed has a sound background belongs to 

established  and  highly  respectful  family  from  Peshawar”.    In  addition, 

in  written  statement,  under  the  heading  “brief  history  of  the  case” 

under  paragraph  (b.),  petitioner  maintained  that  “although  both  the 

parties  were  strangers  to  each  other  yet  this  is  a  marriage  of  cordial 

understanding  (a  love  marriage)  between  the  parties.  It  is  imperative  to 

mention  over  here  that  both  the  families  are  well  education  and  have 

sublime  social  status  in  the  twin  cities  of  Rawalpindi  and  Islamabad 

while  the  defendant  is  well  educated,  balanced  groomed  with  sound 

background, belongs to an old  well known, established and respectable 

family of Peshawar, he is conscious about marital obligation as a Muslim 

husband. “ 

11. 

In  the  presence  of  above  evidence,  there  left  no  need  to  lay  any 

further comment on the issue. It is, therefore, held that the quantum of 

maintenance  fixed  by  the  Family  Court  and  affirmed  by  the  Appellate 

Court,  in  the  light  of  pleadings  and  evidence  on  record,  is  just  and 

appropriate  and  does  not  call  for  any  interference.  Consequently, 

instant writ petition fails and accordingly dismissed.
