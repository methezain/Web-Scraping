Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner,  Bibi lbrat  Fatima, seeks a direction  to the 

Capital  Development  Authority 

("C.D.A.") 

to 

complete  the  formalities  for  given  her  peaceful 

possession  of  plot  No.386/A,  Sector  F-11/3, 

Islamabad.  Furthermore,  the  petitioner  seeks  an 

injunction  against  the  creation  of  a  third  party 

interest over the said plot. 

2. 

Learned counsel for  the petitioner  submitted 

that  the  petitioner  is  one  of  the  descendants  of 

Baba  Sakhi  Muzammal Shah;  that  the  petitioner 

owned  land  in  village  Bhaika  Syedan,  which  had 

been acquired by the C.D.A.; that the award for the 

acquisition  of  land  in  village  Bhaika  Syedan was 

issued on 01.10.1985; that  as a compensation, the 

said plot No.386/A was allotted  to the petitioner  by 

the  C.D.A. vide allotment  letter  dated  25.08.1990; 

that  the  list  of  affectees  in village  Bhaika  Syedan 

also includes the  petitioner's  father,  brothers  and 

sister  to  whom  the  plots  in  the  vicinity  of  plot 

No.386/A  were  allotted;  and 

that  since 

the 

petitioner  is the lawful allottee of plot No.386/A, the 

C.D.A. is bound to give peaceful possession of the 

said plot to her.

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  further 

submitted  that  plot  No.386/A  is  presently 

in 

unlawful  possession of  respondent  No.3; that  the 

person from whom respondent  No.3 claims to have 

purchased  plot  No.386/A was  not  a  resident  of 

village Bhaika  Syedan,Â· and that  the C.D.A. may be 

directed  to  handover peaceful  possession of  plot 

No.386/A to the petitioner.  Learned counsel for the 

petitioner  prayed for the writ  petition  to be allowed 

in terms of the relief sought therein. 

4.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.3 submitted  that  respondent  No.3 

(Muhammad Iqbal) was the  bonafide  purchaser  of 

plot  No.386/A vide  transfer/allotment  letter  dated 

20.08.2014 issued by the  C.O.A.; that  respondent 

No.3 has been in lawful possession of the said plot 

ever since he purchased the same from the original 

allottee  namely Mr. Abdul Jalil  (respondent  No.4); 

that at no material stage was plot No.386/A allotted 

to the petitioner;  that  there  is no reference  to  plot 

No.386/A in the  allotment  letter  dated  25.08.1990; 

that vide letter dated 25.08.1990, only a conditional 

offer of allotment of a plot measuring 30 x 70 feet in 

Sector  F-11, as a  special  case,  was  made to  the 

petitioner;  that  vide  the  said  letter,  the  C.D.A. 

required  the petitioner  to submit an affidavit  to the 

effect  that  no  residential  plot/house  in  Islamabad 

stood in her name; that  in paragraph  2  of the writ 

petition,  it  has  wrongly  been  pleaded  that  plot 

No.386/A was allotted  to the petitioner;  that  in the 

prayer  clause  of 

the  said  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner  has  prayed  for  peaceful  possession of 

plot  No.386/A to  be  handed over  to  her;  and that 

since plot  No.386/A has never been allotted  to the 

petitioner,  the  question  of  possession of  the  said 

plot  to  be  given  to  her  does  not  arise.  Learned 

3 

W.P. No.986of2015 

counsel for  respondent  No.3 prayed  for  the  writ 

petition to be dismissed. 

5. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  C.D.A.  submitted 

that  as  compensation for  the  acquisition  of  the 

petitioner's  property  in village  Bhaika  Syedan, the 

petitioner  was offered plot  No.188 (measuring 30 x 

70 feet)  in  Sector  F-11/4 by  the  C.D.A.; that  plot 

No.386/A had  not  been allotted  to  the  petitioner; 

and that  the petitioner  has no vested right  for  plot 

No.386/A to be allotted to her. Learned counsel for 

the  C.D.A.  prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be 

dismissed. 

6. 

I  have heard the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for 

the  contesting  parties  and  have 

perused the record with their  able assistance. 

7. 

The  petitioner  asserts  her  rights  over  plot 

No.386/A on  the  basis  of  C.D.A. 's  letter  dated 

25.08.1990. Perusal of the said letter  shows that  a 

conditional  offer  for  allotment  of  a  plot  in  Sector 

F-11, as a special case, was made to the petitioner 

by the C.D.A., and the  petitioner  was required  to 

swear  an  affidavit  deposing to  the  effect  that  no 

residential  plot/house  in  Islamabad stood  in  her 

name or  in the  name of  her  spouse or  dependent 

children.  A formal  allotment  letter  was not issued 

to  the  petitioner.  The said  affidavit  was  required 

from the petitioner  so that  a  formal allotment letter 

could be issued to  her. Therefore, the petitioner's 

assertion that  plot  No.386/A had  been allotted  to 

her  by  the  C.D.A.  is  not  supported  by  any 

document on the record. 

8. 

The petitioner  relied on a document annexed 

at  page  14  of  this  petition  to  show  that  plot 

No.386/A had  been allotted  to  her,  and  that  her 

father,  brothers  and sister  had been allotted plots 

in the same vicinity  as plot  No.386/A. No reference 

4 

W.P. No.986of2015 ....... 

to this document has been made in the letter  dated 

25.08.1990  addressed  by 

the  C.D.A.  to 

the 

petitioner.  It  is  not  known who  the  author  of  the 

said document is. This document cannot  be given 

the status of an allotment  letter,  therefore,  I  am of 

the  view 

that 

the  petitioner  cannot  assert 

ownership rights over plot No.386/A on the basis of 

the said document. 

9. 

In the  parawise comments filed  on behalf of 

the C.D.A., it has been pleaded with  clarity  that the 

petitioner  had been offered plot No.188 (measuring 

30 x 70 feet) in Sector  F-11 /4 and that  the said plot 

had been earmarked for  allotment  to  her after  the 

fulfillment  of  procedural 

requirements.  The 

petitioner 

instead  of  accepting 

the  offer  of 

allotment  of  plot  No.188, is  seeking  to  be  given 

possession of a  plot of her choice. It is my view that 

it  is  not  an  affectee's  right  or  prerogative  to  be 

allotted  a  plot  of  his/her  choice.  No  plausible 

explanation has been given by the learned counsel 

for the petitioner  for  not accepting  the offer for the 

allotment of plot No.188 in Sector F-11 /4. 

10.  Plot No.386/A was transferred  to respondent 

No.3 by the  C.D.A. through  allotment  letter  dated 

20.08.2014.  The  said 

transfer/allotment 

letter 

shows that  the plot  had been transferred  from the 

name of Mr. Abdul Jalil  in respondent  No.3's name. 

Since  the  petitioner  was  never  allotted  plot 

No.386/A, she cannot  insist  on  respondent  No.3's 

plot  to  be  allotted  to  her.  The  mere fact  that  the 

petitioner's  family members had been allotted plots 

in  the  said  vicinity  as  plot  No.386/A  would  not 

confer  a  vested  right  on  her  to  be  allotted  plot 

No.386/A. 

5 

W.P. No.986  of 2015 

11. 

In view of the above, I  do not find any merit in 

this petition which is accordingly  dismissed with no 

order as to costs.
