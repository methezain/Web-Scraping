Tariq, Advocates for the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner has called in question orders dated 

06.10.2016 

and 

18.09.2021,  whereby 

objection  petition  filed  by  the  petitioner  was 

not  entertained  and  the  order  for  return  of 

the  gold  was  not  passed  by  the  courts 

below.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  it  is  categorically 

mentioned in the order regarding dissolution 

of  marriage  that  the  marriage  has  been 

dissolved  and  respondent  No.1  was  liable  to 

return  25-Tolas  gold  ornaments,  which  she 

received against the dower but the said gold 

has  not  been  returned  and  the  objection 

petition  filed  by  the  petitioner  was  not 

entertained,  vide  the  impugned  order  and 

objection  petition  was  dismissed.  Learned 

counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance 

on  cases  reported  as “Mst. Hamidan Begum 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
VS Abdul Riaz and 02 others”  (1993 CLC 

2170),  “Syed Muhammad VS Mst. Zeenat 

and others.”  (PLD 2001 SC 128),  “Syed 

Muhammad VS Mst. Zeenat and others.” 

(PLD 2001 SC 128), “Mst. Zakiya Bibi and 

another VS Murtaza Shah and 2 others” 

(2018 YLR 1501)  and  “Sher Zaman VS 

Mst. Mahzari  and  2  others”  (2018  YLR 

128). Learned counsel further contends that 

the  impugned  orders  are  passed  in  violation 

of the dictum laid down by superior courts of 

the country, hence same are liable to be set-

aside.
