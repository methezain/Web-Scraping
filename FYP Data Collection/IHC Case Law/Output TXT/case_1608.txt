LUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ, J.   

Present writ petition has been filed by the 

petitioner under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan 

seeking following direction from this Court:- 

“It  is,  therefore,  respectfully prayed  that  this  Honorable  Court  may 
kindly direct Respondent No. 1 to allow the benefit of S.R.O. No. 494 
(I)/2013 dated June 10, 2013, to the Petitioner and to withdraw the 
recovery  notices  with  the  order  to  refund  to  the  petitioner  the 
amount  of  Rs.  74,190,040  being  50%  of  the  default  surcharge  and 
penalty,  already  paid  under  duress  by  the  Petitioner  and  without 
prejudice  to  the  outcome  of  the  proceeding  before  the  Honorable 
Islamabad High Court.”.  

2. 

Facts  of  the  case  are  that  the  petitioner  is  a  public  limited  company 

engaged  in  the  business  of  Exploration  and  Production  of  Oil  and  Gas. 

Proceedings were initiated against the petitioner company for recovery of short 

payment of sales tax along with default surcharge u/s 34 and penalty u/s 33 

of  the  Sales  Tax  Act,  1990,  and  Order-in-Original  No.  17/105,  dated 

04.02.2011,  was  passed  whereby  Rs.  1,631,469,011/-  was  determined  as 

recoverable on account of sales tax for the period from July, 2008 to December, 

2010.  Thereafter,  Sales  Tax  Order-in-Original  No.  04/110,  dated  12.09.2011, 

issued on 12.09.2011, was passed and sales tax demand of Rs. 161,807,109/- 

was determined for the period from January, 2011 to March, 2011. The Order-

in-Original  No.  17/105,  dated  04.02.2011,  was  finally  upheld  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court and the amount adjudged vide Order-in-Original was also paid

by  the  petitioner.  It  has  been  contended  by  the  petitioner  that  the  appeal 

against the Order-in-Original No. 04/2011 dated 12.09.2011, was also turned 

down  by  the  Appellate  Tribunal  against  which  sales  tax  reference  u/s  47  of 

Sales Tax Act 1990, was filed before the Hon’ble High Court. Meanwhile, notice 

u/s  48  (1)(b)  read  with  Rule  71  (2)(b)  of  the  Sales  Tax  Rules,  2006,  dated 

25.02.2013  was  issued  to  the  Petitioner  for  recovery  of  default  surcharge  and 

penalty amounting to Rs. 148,380,080/- imposed while passing the above cited 

Order-in-Originals on the short payment of sales tax . It has been contended by 

the petitioner that Rs. 74,190,040 being 50% of the total default surcharge and 

penalty  was  paid,  vide  pay  order  No.  8102184  dated  18.03.2013.  In  the 

meantime  the  Government  of  Pakistan  issued  notification  bearing  SRO  No. 

494(I)/2013,  dated  10.06.2013  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  SRO  494),  to  grant 

exemption  from  payment  of  default  surcharge  and  penalty,  subject  to  the 

condition  of  payment  of  principal  amount  of  sales  tax  paid  on  or  before  30th 

June,  2013.  The  petitioner,  therefore,  vide  letter  dated  27.06.2013,  requested 

the respondent to extend the benefit of amnesty scheme announced vide above 

said  S.R.O  and  waive  the  default  surcharge  and  penalty  imposed  vide  above 

cited  two  Order-in-Originals  and  also  refund  the  amount  of  Rs.  74,190,040/- 

paid under duress by the petitioner company on account of default surcharge 

and penalty. However, Respondent No. 1, vide letter dated 10.06.2013, rejected 

the  petitioner’s  request  for  the  reason  that  effect  of  the  amnesty  allowed  vide 

S.R.O. dated 10.06.2013, is prospective and not retrospective in nature; hence 

present petition.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the  Petitioner  is 

entitled to the benefits of SRO 494 as it had paid the entire principal amount 

determined  vide  Order-in-Originals  Nos.17/105  and  04/110,  dated 

04.02.2011  &  13.08.2011,  respectively,  well  before  30.06.2013,  which  fact 

has  not  been  denied  by  the  respondent;  that  the  SRO  494,  is  beneficial 

notification  issued  with  the  intention  to  end  the  litigation  pending  before 

 
Writ Petition No. 3537 of 2013 
M/s Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd. VS Commissioner Inland Revenue, etc 

3 

various courts; that contention of the respondent that  the effect of the SRO 

494, is prospective and not retrospective in nature is contrary to the concept 

of interpretation of statutes as it is well established that beneficial legislation 

is  always  applied  retrospectively.  Learned  counsel  in  support  of  his 

contentions  placed  reliance  on  the  judgment  of  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court 

Shiekh Wahid ud Din Industries VS ACST (2006 PTD 336).  

4. 

Learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 has objected to the maintainability 

of  the  present  petition  as  not  being  competently  filed  and  submitted  that  no 

document  to  prove  the  locus  standi  of  the  signatory  has  been  appended  with 

the  petition  and  placed  reliance  on  the  judgments  reported  as  PLD  1979  SC 

550  and  PLD  1997  Karachi  62.  Learned  counsel  submitted  that  the  issue  of 

short  payment  of  sales  tax  determined  against  the  petitioner  vide  Order-in-

Original No. 17/105, dated 04.02.2011, was upheld up to the  apex court  and 

in  respect  of  Order-in-Original  No.  14/110  dated  13.08.2011,  he  contended 

that the petitioner has not assailed the judgment of Hon’ble High Court before 

the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  thus  the  charge  of  short  payment  of 

sales  tax  has  been  confirmed  and,  therefore,  the  benefit  of  SRO  494  is  not 

extendable  to  the  petitioner.  Learned  counsel  submitted  that  the  judgment  of 

Hon’ble Lahore High Court relied upon by the petitioner is distinguishable as it 

relates  to  a  different  notification  bearing  S.R.O.  No.  575(I)/1998,  dated 

12.06.1998.  Learned  counsel  contended  that  SRO  494  is  a  conditional 

notification  whereby  vide  para  2  of  the  said  S.R.O.  it  has  been  clearly 

mentioned  that  benefits  of  S.R.O.  shall  not  be  available  to  cases  of  fraudulent 

refunds, drawback or any case involving tax or duty fraud or where prosecution 

proceedings  have  been  initiated,  and  submitted  that  since  the  petitioner  has 

been  prosecuted  for  recovery  of  short  payment  of  sales  tax,  vide  Order-in-

Originals thus petitioner’s  case is outside the scope of SRO 494. 

5. 

Arguments of the learned counsel for the parties have been heard and 

the record appended with the petition has been examined.

6. 

Regarding  preliminary  objection,  it  has  been  observed  that  the 

petitioner is a statutory organization established vide Oil & Gas Development 

Ordinance, 1961 which provides for the Board of Directors under Section 5 

and  Chairman  under  Section  6.  Further  section  26  of  the  Ordinance  1961 

provides 

for  general  or  special  order 

in  writing 

for  delegation  of 

administrative  and  financial  powers.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

furnished  the  copy  of  letter/resolution  delegating  the  powers  of  instituting 

legal  proceedings  before  the  Court.  The  preliminary  objection  is,  therefore, 

rejected.  

7. 

Present petition involves a short controversy that whether the benefits 

of amnesty issued for allowing exemption from payment of default surcharge 

and  penalty  under  the  Sales  Tax  Act,  1990,  introduced  vide  SRO  494  is 

extendable  to  the  petitioner  when  admittedly  the  principal  amount  of  sales 

tax  has  already  been  paid  before  30.06.2013.  It  would  be  advantageous  to 

reproduce the contents of the said S.R.O which are as under:-

(CUSTOMS, SALES TAX, FEDERAL EXCISE AND INCOME TAX) 

Islamabad, The10th June,2013. 

S.R.O.494(l)/2013.-In  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  by  section  34A  of 
the Sales Tax Act,1990, sub-section (4) of section16 of the Federal Excise Act, 2005, 
section  202A  of  the  Customs Act,  1969  (IV of  1969)  and  section  183  of  the  Income 
Tax  Ordinance,  2001  (XLIX  of  2001),  the  Federal  Government  is  pleased  to  exempt  the 
whole  amount  of  default  surcharge,  penalty  and  other  surcharge  payable  by  a  person 
against whom an amount of sales tax, federal excise duty, customs duty or income tax 
(including  withholding  tax)  is  outstanding  on  account  of  any  audit  observation,

Perusal  of  the  S.R.O.  reveals  that  it  has  been  issued  in  exercise  of  powers 

conferred  under  relevant  sections  of  Sales  Tax  Act,  1990,  Income  Tax 

Ordinance,  2001,  Custom  Tax  Act,  1969,  and  Federal  Excise  Act,  2005, 

whereby,  the  Federal  Government  waived  the  whole  amount  of  default 

surcharge  and  penalty  and  other  surcharge  payable  by  a  person  on  the 

condition  of  payment  of  outstanding  principal  amount  due  as  Sales  Tax, 

Federal Excise Duty, Custom Duty or Income Tax by 30th June, 2013. Para 

No. 2, of the notification provides exclusion of the cases of fraudulent refund, 

drawback  or  any  case  involving  tax  or  duty  fraud  or  where  prosecution 

proceedings have been initiated. The notification has been issued under the 

delegated  legislation  prima  facie  with  the  purpose  to  allow  amnesty  from 

charge of default surcharge and penalty if the principle amount determined 

under any federal revenue law is paid before 30.06.2013. The contention of 

the Respondent that SRO 494 has no retrospective application in view of the 

fact  that  the  payment  of  principle  amount  has  been  paid  by  the  Petitioner 

before  the  issuance  of  SRO,  has  no  force,  as  the  SRO  do  not  provide  any 

such  condition  of  limiting  the  dates  of  payment  of  tax  between  issuance  of 

SRO  and  30.06.2013  for  availing  amnesty.  Admittedly  the  due  amount  of 

sales  tax  determined  through  Order-in-Originals  has  been  paid  before  the 

cutoff date announced in the notification, therefore, the petitioner cannot be 

deprived  from  availing  the  benefit  of  amnesty  on  the  pretext  of  payment  of 

principle amount of sales tax by the Petitioner before issuance of SRO 494. I 

am in agreement with the argument of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner 

that it is beneficial notification issued to provide benefits of waiver of default 

surcharge  and  penalty  on  the  solitary  condition  of  payment  of  principle 

amount of tax/duty on or before 30.06.2013 and under settled principles of 

interpretation,  the  beneficial  notification  has  always  a  retrospective 

application.

7. 

Learned Counsel for the Respondent has also contended that the case 

of the petitioner falls under the exclusion provided under para 2 of the SRO 

494 as the short payment of sales tax demand has been determined through 

Order-in-Originals  which  are  prosecution  proceedings  in  nature,  therefore 

the case of the petitioner is out of the ambit of SRO 494. This contention of 

the  Learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  has  also  no  force  as  the  Order-in-

Original  is  a  result  of  adjudication  proceedings  for  assessment  and 

determination  of  tax,  whereas,  prosecution  is  a  criminal  proceeding  in 

nature  which 

is  separate  and 

independent 

judicial  proceeding 

for 

determination  and  conviction  of  offences  for  violation  of  laws  and  such 

proceeding  in  tax  laws  is  initiated  after  adjudication  and  determination  of 

tax.  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court  has  explained  the  word  “adjudicate”and 

“adjudication” in the following cases as under:- 

  M/s Prime Chemicals V/s Government Of Pakistan (2004 P T D 1388) 

To  adjudicate,  necessarily  implies  settling,  a  matter.  This  is  synonymous 
with  the  word  `adjudge'.  The  adjudicatory  process  may  be  before  an 
administrative  authority  or  before  a  Court  of  law.  Even  if  it  is  before  an 
administrative  agency,  the  rights  are  to  be  adjudged  after  notice  to  parties 
affording  opportunity  of hearing  and  appraisal  of  record.  The factual  position 
and the finding are to be recorded specifically. 

  ShahzadHussain v/s Judge Family Court, Lahore (2011 C L C 820) 

The concept of adjudication has also been elaborated by the superior Courts 
by holding that it refers to judicial determination of a matter in controversy as 
distinguished from determination by a Court on the administrative side. 

The term “prosecution” has been defined by the Hon’ble Sindh High Court as 

under:- 

  Ismail  Abdul  Rahman  v.  Mohammad  Sadiq  and  3  others,  (PLD  1990  Karachi 

286) 

'Prosecution'  or  'prosecute'  in  the  special  sense  of law  means,  according 
to Webster 's Dictionary: "(a) to follow, pursue, to follow to the end, to seek 
to obtain;  to enforce, or the like, by legal process, to prosecute a right or  a 
claim  in  a  Court  of  law;  (b):  to  pursue  to  institute  legal  proceedings  for 
redress  or  punishment;  to  proceed  against  judicially;  esp.,  to  accuse  of 
some  crime  or  breach  of  law,  or  to  pursue  for  redress  or  punishment  of  a 
crime  or  violation  of  law,  in  due  legal  form  -  before  a  legal  tribunal;  the 
carrying  on  of  a  judicial  proceeding  on  behalf  of  a  complaining  party,  the 
institution  and  continuance  of  a  criminal  suit  involving  the  process  of 
exhibiting  formal  charges  against  an  offender  before  a  legal  tribunal  and 
pursuing them to find judgment on behalf of the State or Government'. 

According  to  Wharton's  Law  Lexicon  by  A.S.  Oppe,  14th  edition  (1976 
Reprint)  page  810,  'prosecution'  means  "a  proceeding  either  by  way  of 
indictment  or  information,  in  the  Criminal  Courts,  in  order  to  put  an 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 3537 of 2013 
M/s Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd. VS Commissioner Inland Revenue, etc 

7 

offender upon his trial". 

The  word  'prosecution'  occurring  in  Article  13  would  mean  an  initiation  or 
starting  of  proceedings  of  criminal  nature  before  a  Court  of  Law  or  a 
Judicial Tribunal in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Statute 
which creates the offences and regulates the procedure. 

8. 

Thus the “adjudication” and “prosecution” are two separate, distinct and 

independent proceedings and the term prosecution used in SRO 494 cannot be 

equated  with  adjudication/determination  of  shortfall  or  sales  tax  recoverable 

from petitioner to exclude its case from the scope of the SRO 494. 

9.  

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, has relied on the judgment of Hon’ble 

Lahore High Court passed in the case titled Shiekh Wahid ud Din Industries 

VS ACST (2006 PTD 336), wherein, the SRO No. 575 (I)/98 dated 12.06.1998  

was  issued  to  grant  exemption  from  additional  tax  under  section  34  and 

penalties  under  section  33  of  the  Sales  Tax  Act,  1990,  on  the  condition  of 

payment of the principal amount of tax due by the date mentioned therein. The 

controversy was resolved in favour of the taxpayer and the relevant findings are 

also reproduced as under:- 

“5. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we are not persuaded 
to  agree  that  the  amnesty  S.R.O.  No.  575(I)/98;  dated  12-6-1998  is  not 
applicable to the case of the present appellant. It needs to be noted that the 
amnesty contemplated in that S.R.O. as per paras. 2 and 3 thereof was also 
available to cases of taxpayers pending in appeals. If the interpretation of 
that  S.R.O.  as  made  by  the  Revenue  authorities  as  well  as  the  Tribunal  is 
accepted  then  it  is  likely  to  create  an  anomalous  situation.  It  is  that 
whereas the persons who had already paid the amount due will be deprived 
of  the  amnesty  while  those  who  will  pay  that  amount  after  the  issuance  of 
S.R.O.  575(I)/98  on  12-6-1998  will  be  spared  of  the  additional  tax  and 
penalty.  In  other  words  a  person  who  had  already  paid  the  due  tax  to  the 
public exchequer will be burdened with additional tax and penalty while the 
one who does so after issuance of that notification and having withheld the 
amount  of  the  tax  due  from  him  in  the  meanwhile  will  be  rewarded  by 
allowing  exemption  from  A  penalty  and  levy  of  additional  tax.  This  could 
never be the intention of any superior or subordinate legislation. A person 
placed  in  similar  factual  situation  cannot  be  discriminated  against  merely 
for the reason that he has first to be a continuous defaulter on a particular 
date  of  grant  of  amnesty  in  order  to  avail  the  same.  The  appellant  having 
paid  the  fixed  tax  before  the  issuance  of  the  said  S.R.O.  but  before  the 
issuance  of  show-cause  notice  was  clearly  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the 
amnesty contemplated in the S.R.O. To hold otherwise would be negation of 
justice fair equal protection of law. 

6.  It  needs  to  be  brought  home  that  the  amnesty  granting  legislation  both 
superior  as  well  as  subordinate  needs  to  be  construed  liberally  so  that  it 
does  not  either  trap  an  unwary  taxpayer  or  else  otherwise  succeeds  in 
taking  away  with the  other  hand  while  giving it  by the one. The  petitioner 
having  paid  the  fixed  tax  due  from  him  is  as  much  entitled  to  the  amnesty 
contemplated 
registered 
S.R.O. 
person/manufacturer  who  pays  the  fixed  tax  amount  after  issuance  of  th e 
S.R.O. To hold otherwise would result in the situation as noted above.”.

10.  The above  said  judgment  [Shiekh Wahid ud Din Industries VS ACST 

(2006 PTD 336)] relied upon by the learned counsel for the Petitioner squarely 

applies to the issue agitated  through present  petition. In view of the  foregoing 

discussion and the judgment passed in Sheikh Wahid ud Din Industries’ case 

cited supra, impugned letter dated 10.07.2013  is  set aside. It  is held that the 

petitioner  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  of  amnesty  announced  vide  S.R.O. 

494(I)/2013, dated 10.06.2013. So far as the refund of Rs. 74,190,040/- paid 

by the petitioner on account default surcharge and penalty is concerned, I am 

of the view that the Sales Tax Act 1990 and the Rules made thereunder provide 

separate  proceedings  for  such  refund.  The  petitioner  is  at  liberty  to  apply  for 

refund  of  the  amount  in  accordance  with  the  prescribed  procedure  under  the 

Sales Tax Act, 1990 read with Sales Tax Rules 2006.  

Instant petition is allowed in the above terms.
