petitioner. 

  The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  (i)  the 

judgment passed by the learned Family Court 

dated  11.12.2020,  pursuant  to  which  the 

custody  of  the  petitioner’s  and  respondent’s 

No.3  son  (minor)  has  been  awarded  to 

respondent  No.3  alongwith  an  order  of 

maintenance  of  the  children  together  with 

payment  of  maintenance  allowance 

to 

respondent  No.3  till  completion  of  her  iddat 

period,  and  (ii)  the  judgment  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District 

Judge  dated 

16.07.2021,  pursuant  to  which  the  judgment 

of the learned Family Court has been upheld. 

2.    The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

states  that  the  learned  appellate  Court  has 

passed 

the 

impugned 

judgment  without 

application  of  mind.  That  while  upholding  the 

judgment  of  the  learned  Family  Court  which 

awarded  the  maintenance  of  Rs.6,000/-  to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respondent  No.3,  the  learned  appellate  Court 

has enhanced it to Rs.15,000/- without stating 

any reason. He further states that the learned 

appellate  Court  has  misstated 

that 

the 

custody  of  respondent  No.4  is  with  the 

petitioner as evident from the judgment of the 

learned Family Court. He further submits that 

the judgment of the learned Family Court also 

suffers  from  infirmities  as  in  the  interest  of 

welfare of the minors, son and daughter of the 

petitioner  and  respondent  No.3  age  six  year, 

should  have  been  granted  to  the  petitioner 

and not respondent No.3.  

3.    Issue notices to respondents No.3 & 4 for 

07.10.2021,  who  may  file  any  para-wise 

comments within a period of two weeks.
