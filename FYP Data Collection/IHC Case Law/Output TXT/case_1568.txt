Petitioner 
learned  ASC. 

in  person  with  Jam  Khurshid  Ahmed, 

Contends  that  the  petitioner  with  the 

consent  of  her  parents  and  with  her  own  free 

will  contracted  marriage  with  Waqar  Hussain 

son of Ghulam Mustafa, present in the court,  but 

thereafter,  due  to  family  dispute,  father  of  the 

petitioner/respondent  No.2,  is  adamant to  take 

back  the  petitioner  and  to  force  her  to  get 

divorce.  It  is further  asserted  that  the father  of 

the  petitioner  had  expressly  consented  for  the 

marriage  of  the  petitioner  with  Waqar Hussain, 

and also participated  in the marriage  ceremony 

held about a  year ago on 25.08.2019 as reveals 

through  Nikah Nama, available at  Page-7 of the 

petition. 

Further  contends 

that 

the 

fact  of 

marriage  of  the  petitioner  with  Waqar  Hussain, 

is  also  admitted  by  her  father/respondent  No.2 

in W.P. No.9778-H/2020, filed  seeking  recovery 

of the petitioner. 

According 

to 

the 

learned  counsel, 

neither  the  petitioner  was  abducted  nor  had 

been  compelled  by  anybody  to  enter 

into 

marriage  with  Waqar  Hussain  and  that  the 

respondent  No.2  is  constantly  chasing  the 

petitioner  for  settling  the  score  of  the  grudge, 

inter-se 

the  families. 

It 

is  added  that  the 

petitioner apprehends immense threat  to her life 

and  life  of  her  spouse which  compelled  her  to 

take  shelter  at  Islamabad,  hence,  the  instant 

writ  petition. 

Considering  the  stance  of  the  learned 

counsel as bonafide  which  is duly supported  ~y 

copy  of  Nikah  Nama  and  copy  of  W.P.  No. 

9778/2020, available on file,  respondent  No.1 is 

directed  to  provide  all  protections  and security 

to the petitioner  and her spouse, so to avoid any 

untoward 

incident 

in  order 

to  protect 

fundamental 

rights  guaranteed  under 

the 

Constitution. 

Copy  of  the  order  along  with  petition 

and  annexures  thereto  be  transmitted  to  the 

respondent No.1 for compliance. 

Disposed of in above terms.
