Nemo.  

The case was called time and again, 

even  it  was  taken  up  at  late  hours  but  no  one 

has  put  an  appearance  on  behalf  of  the 

petitioner. The matter pertains to the year 2015, 

it  seems  that  no  one  is  serious  in  pursuing  the 

case, therefore, the instant petition is dismissed 

for non-prosecution.
