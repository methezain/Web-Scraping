MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  this  judgment, 

we  propose  to  decide  regular first appeals  No.08/2017,  09/2017  and 

14/2017 since they entail common questions of law and fact. 

2. 

Through regular  first appeal  No.08/2017, the  appellants,  Kamil 

Rehman Khan, etc., who are legal heirs of Haji Zarwar Khan (“Zarwar 

Khan”), 

impugn  the  consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

19.12.2016  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned  Civil  Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  suit  for  declaration  and  permanent  injunction 

(“Suit No.90/2006”) instituted on 30.11.1998 by Zarwar Khan against 

Rehman Bangash  was dismissed.  In  the said suit,   Zarwar Khan had 

prayed for a declaration to the effect that he is the actual and lawful 

owner  in  possession  of  House  No.24,  Street  No.2,  E-7,  Islamabad 

(“the suit house”) whereas Rehman Bangash was a benamidar having 

no concern with the suit house. 

3. 

Through regular  first appeal  No.09/2017,  the  appellants,  Kamil 

Rehman  Khan  etc.,  impugn  the  said  judgment  and  decree  dated 

19.12.2016  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court,  whereby  suit  for 

possession  through  ejectment,  recovery  of  compensation  damages 

and  permanent 

injunction 

(“Suit  No.1012/2013”) 

instituted  on 

21.03.1998  by  Rehman  Bangash  against  Zarwar  Khan  was  decreed 

holding  that  the  former  was  entitled  to  (i)  possession  of  the  suit 

house,  and  (ii)  rent  at  the  rate  of  Rs.1,20,000/-  per  month  from 

January 1998 till the handing over of possession of the suit house.   

4. 

Through regular first appeal No.14/2017, the appellant, Rehman 

Bangash,  has 

impugned  the  said 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

                
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
2 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

19.12.2016  passed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court  only  to  the  extent 

whereby his  claim for damages was turned down and compensation 

to the tune of Rs.1,20,000/- per month was awarded in his favour. He 

has  prayed 

for  an  enhancement  of 

the  compensation 

to 

Rs.10,00,000/- per month.    

5. 

Rehman  Bangash  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  “respondent 

No.1”)  was  Zarwar  Khan’s  nephew  (bhatija)  as  well  as  son-in-law. 

Vide 

letter  dated  10.04.1984  (Exh.P/1) 

issued  by  the  Estate 

Management  Directorate  of  the  Capital  Development  Authority 

(“C.D.A.”) ownership in the suit house was transferred to respondent 

No.1.  The  position  taken  by  respondent  No.1  in  Suit  No.1012/2013 

instituted by him was that he being the lawful owner of the suit house 

was  entitled  to  gain  possession  of  the  suit  house  from  Zarwar  Khan 

and also recover rent/compensation from him. The position taken by 

Zarwar Khan, in his Suit No.90/2006, was that he was the real owner 

of the suit house whereas respondent No.1 was an ostensible/benami 

owner. 

6. 

During  the  pendency  of  the  said  suits,  Zarwar  Khan  passed 

away  whereafter  his  legal  heirs  were  impleaded  as  parties.  The 

appellants, save one, in regular first appeals No.08/2017 and 09/2017 

are  the  legal  heirs  of  Zarwar  Khan.  Mst.  Waqif  Jan,  who  is  Zarwar 

Khan’s  daughter  and  married  to  respondent  No.1,  has  not  assailed 

the said consolidated judgment and decree dated 19.12.2016. In the 

said appeals, she has been impleaded as respondent No.2. The legal 

heirs 

of 

Zarwar 

Khan 

except  

Mst. Waqif Jan shall hereinafter be referred to as “the appellants”.  

7. 

After  the  said  suits  were  consolidated,  the  learned  Civil  Court

1998 till possession of the suit house was handed over to him.     

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE 
APPELLANTS:- 

9. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  submitted  that  the  learned 

Civil Court erred by applying the provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat 

Order,  1984  (“the  1984  Order”)  to  documents  executed  prior  to  the 

said  law  coming  into  force;  that  the  1984  Order  came  into  force  on 

26.10.1984  whereas  the  documents  in  question  were  executed  on 

04.06.1984  and  15.01.1984;  and  that  the  impugned  judgment  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

decree  was  passed  on  the  basis  of  documents  which  were 

inadmissible in the evidence.  

10.  Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  further  submitted  that  the 

funds  for  the  purchase  of  the  suit  house  were  provided  by  Zarwar 

Khan; that in compliance with the order dated 21.01.2000 passed by 

the  learned  Civil  Court,  Zarwar  Khan  had  produced  a  copy  of  bank 

draft  No.527576,  dated  15.01.1984,  for  an  amount  of  Rs.10,00,000/- 

drawn on Allied Bank Limited; that respondent No.1 had produced a 

copy  of  the  said  bank  draft  after  the  same  had  been  produced  by 

Zarwar  Khan;  that  the  learned  Civil  Court  erroneously  placed  an 

exhibit number on a copy of the said bank draft; that the services of a 

Contractor  (Bashir  Ahmad)  had  been  engaged  by  Zarwar  Khan  for 

the  construction  of  a  house  on  the  plot  purchased  from  Mst.  Tahira 

Zaheer;  that  Zarwar  Khan  had  entered  into  an  agreement  (Exh.D/4) 

with M/s Saeed Associates Consulting Architect for the design of the 

suit  house;  that  respondent  No.1  was  only  about  24  years  of  age  in 

the  year  1984  when  the  suit  house  was  purchased;  that  respondent 

No.1  had  deposed  that  he  had  done  his  F.A.  from  the  Government 

College, Hangu in the year 1980-81, and that  in January 1982, he was 

taken to Qatar when his age was 20 to 22 years; that respondent No.1 

did  not  have  financial  means  to  purchase  the  suit  house;  that 

respondent No.1 also deposed that he had no evidence to prove that 

he  had  transferred  funds  from  Qatar  to  Pakistan,  and  that  in  those 

days, funds used to be transferred by him through hundi to his father 

and  brother;  that  in  fact  in  those  days  respondent  No.1  was 

financially  dependent on his    paternal uncle,  Zarwar  Khan,  who was 

also living in Qatar; that ever since 1987 when the construction of the 

suit  house  was  completed,  the  possession,  constructive  and 

otherwise  had  remained  with  Zarwar  Khan  and/or  his  sons;  that 

between 1989 and 1996, the suit house was given on rent to various 

tenants  through  agreements  executed  by  the  appellants;  that 

respondent No.1 had never remained in possession of the suit house; 

that in the year 1998, possession of the suit house was handed over 

by  the  tenant  to  Zarwar  Khan;  that  since  Zarwar  Khan’s  family  was 

not in Pakistan in year 1984, the suit house was purchased by him in 

 
 
5 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

respondent  No.1’s  name;  that  it  had  never  been  Zarwar  Khan’s 

intention  to  give  the  suit  house  to  respondent  No.1;  that  all  the 

requisite  documents  with  respect  to  the  sale  transaction  and  the 

construction  of  the  suit  house  were  in  Zarwar  Khan’s  possession; 

that respondent No.1 has come up with different conflicting positions 

regarding  the  possession  of  the  allotment  letter/title  documents 

regarding the suit house; that even though the utility bills were in the 

name of respondent  No.1,  they  were  paid  by  the appellants  who are 

in  possession  of  the  relevant  receipts;  that  the  impugned  judgment 

passed by the learned Civil Court is based on circumstantial evidence 

without  taking  into  consideration  the  relationship  between  the 

contesting  parties  and  the  surrounding  circumstances;  that  Zarwar 

Khan had also purchased properties in the name of his brother, Haji 

Noorwar  Khan,  who  was  respondent  No.1’s  father;  that  respondent 

No.1’s  father  had  executed  an  iqrarnama  in  which  he  had  admitted 

that Hotel  Doha  Palace in Peshawar had  been  purchased  by  Zarwar

relationship  of  trust  existed  between  Zarwar  Khan  and  his  nephew-

cum-son-in-law/respondent  No.1,  the  former  had  purchased  the  suit 

property  in  the  latter's  name.  Learned  counsel  for  the  appellants 

prayed  for  the  appeal  to  be  allowed  and  for  the  consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated  19.12.2016,  passed  by  the  learned  Civil 

Court, to be set-aside. In making his submissions, learned counsel for 

the  appellants  placed  reliance  on  the  judgments  in  the  cases  of 

Ghulam  Murtaza  VS  Mst.  Asia  Bibi  (PLD  2010  SC  569),  Naushad 

Shamsuddin  Fancy  VS  New  Jubilee  Insurance  Company  Limited

577), Malik Muhammad Zubair VS Malik Muhammad Anwar (PLD 2004 

Lahore  515),  Muhammad  Yaseen  Siddiqui  VS  Tahseen  Jawaid 

Siddiqui (2003 MLD 319), Muhammad Zaman VS Sheikh Abdul Hamid 

(2002  CLC  1209)  and  Asal  Muhammad  VS  The  State  (PLD  1994 

Peshawar 214). 

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  RESPONDENT

11.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1 

submitted  that  the  documents  produced  by  Zafarullah  Khan,  Upper 

 
 
 
6 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

Division Clerk, C.D.A. (PW-1) clearly show that the sale consideration 

for the suit house had been paid by respondent No.1; that respondent 

No.1  had  sufficient  earnings  in  Qatar  with  which  the  suit  house  was 

purchased; that the bank draft through which the sale consideration 

had been paid to Mst. Tahira Zaheer had been produced as Exh.P/17 

by respondent No.1/PW-7; that Sohail Ghias Khan appeared as PW-3 

and  deposed  inter alia  that  the  architect  fee  had  been  paid  by 

respondent  No.1;  that  Muhammad  Ali  who  was  the  son  of  the 

construction contractor appeared as PW-8 and identified his father’s 

signature  on  the  books  of  expenses  incurred  on  the  construction  of 

the  suit  house;  that  the  utility  meters  in  the  suit  house  were  in 

respondent  No.1’s  name;  that  after  the  completion  of  the  suit  house 

in  1987,  respondent  No.1  along  with  his  family  resided  in  the  said 

house for a period of nine years; that in 1995, respondent No.1 went 

abroad  and  his  family  shifted  to  live  with  Zarwar  Khan;  that  Zarwar 

Khan  had  given  the  suit  house  on  rent  with  respondent  No.1’s 

consent and upon the latter's return from abroad the rent was paid to 

him;  that  Zarwar  Khan  had  given  the  suit  house  on  rent  to  Mr.  Paul 

Medhurst,  Security  Officer,  UNMOGIP  without  respondent  No.1’s 

consent;  that  respondent  No.1  had  issued  a  legal  notice  to  Mr. 

Medhurst  requiring  the  latter  to  vacate  the  suit  house;  that  the  said 

tenant  handed  over  possession  of  the  suit  house  to  Zarwar  Khan  in 

1998;  that  ever  since  1998,  Zarwar  Khan  and/or  his  sons  are  in 

unlawful  possession  of  the  suit  house;  that  Zarwar  Khan,  in  his  suit 

for  declaration  etc.  has  not  pleaded  the  motive  for  entering  into  a 

benami  transaction  regarding  the  suit  house;  that  possession  of  the 

allotment  letter  had  been  with  respondent  No.1  but  the  same  was 

taken by Zarwar Khan; that none of the ingredients for declaring the 

transaction  for  the  purchase  of  the  suit  house  in  respondent  No.1’s 

name  to  be  a benami  transaction  have  been  satisfied  in  the  case  at 

hand;  that  Zarwar  Khan  and/or  his  sons  were  bound  to  pay 

compensation  to  respondent  No.1  for  the  period  that  they  remained 

in  possession of the suit house;  and  that the  learned  Civil  Court  had 

correctly held respondent No.1 entitled to compensation and unpaid 

rent  but  the  amount  of  compensation  ought  to  be  enhanced  by  this 

 
 
7 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

Court.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  prayed  for  appeals 

No.08/2017  and  09/2017  to  be  dismissed  and  for  appeal  No.14/2017 

to be allowed.  

12.  We  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance.  

13.  As  mentioned  above,  Zarwar  Khan’s  stance  was  that  he  was 

the  real  owner  of  the  suit  property  whereas  respondent  No.1  was 

only an ostensible/benami owner. It is well settled that the burden of 

proving  that  a particular sale is benami  and  the apparent  purchaser 

is not the real owner always rests on the person asserting it to be so. 

In  the  cases  of  Muhammad  Sajjad  Hussain  VS  Muhammad  Anwar 

Hussain (1991 SCMR 703) and Muhammad Siddiqui VS T.J. Ibrahim & 

Company  (2001  SCMR  1443),  it  was  held  that  “the initial burden of 

proof is on the party who alleges that an ostensible owner is a 

Benamidar”.  This  burden  has  to  be  strictly  discharged  by  adducing 

evidence of a definite character which would either directly prove the 

fact  of  benami  or  establish  circumstances  unerringly  raising  an 

inference of that fact. In order to determine whether a transaction is 

benami  or  not,  the  Courts  are  usually  guided  by  the  following 

factors:- 

"(1)  The source from which the purchase money came;  
(2)   The  nature  and  possession  of  the  property,  after  the 

purchase;  

(3)   Motive if any, for giving the transaction a benami complexion;  
(4)   The  position  of  the  parties  and  the  relationship,  if  any, 

between the claimant and the alleged benamidar;  
(5)   The custody of the title-deeds after the transaction; and  
(6)   The conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the 

property after the sale." 

The source from which the money for the purchase of the suit  house 
came:-  

14.  Vide  agreement  to  sell  dated  20.12.1983  (Exh.D/3)  executed 

between Mst. Tahira Zaheer and respondent No.1, the former agreed 

to  sell  the  suit  house  to  the  latter  for  a  total  sale  consideration  of 

Rs.10,75,000/-,  out  of  which  Rs.75,000/-  was  paid  as  earnest  money 

whereas the remaining Rs.10,00,000/- was to be paid by 15.01.1984. 

15.  Vide bank draft No.527576, dated 15.01.1984, for an amount of 

Rs.10,00,000/-  drawn  on  Allied  Bank  Limited,  the  remaining  sale 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

consideration  was  paid  to  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer.  In  suit  No.60/2009, 

Zarwar  Khan  had  pleaded  inter  alia  that  the  remaining  sale 

consideration  had  been  paid  by  him  through  the  said  bank  draft. 

Since a copy of the said bank draft had not been filed along with the 

said  suit,  respondent  No.1  filed  an  application  for  the  production  of 

the  said  bank  draft.  Vide  order  dated  21.01.2000,  the  learned  Civil 

Court directed Zarwar Khan to file a copy of the said bank draft in the 

Court. It appears that on 01.03.2000,  Zarwar Khan produced a copy 

of the said bank draft in the Court.  

16.  Thereafter,  on  06.04.2000,  respondent  No.1  filed  a  written 

statement wherein it was pleaded that respondent No.1 had paid the 

remaining sale consideration through  the said bank draft No.527576 

dated 15.01.1984.  

17. 

In  the  cases  of  Shalimar  Limited  VS  Raisuddin  Siddiqui  (1979 

CLC  338),  Ismail  Dada  Adam  Soomar  VS  Shorat  Bano  (PLD  1960 

Karachi  852)  and  Mst.  Shohrat  Bano  VS  Ismail  Dada  Adam  Soomar 

(1968  SCMR  574),  it  was  held  inter alia that  “the most important 

criteria for determining the benami nature of the transaction is the 

source of the purchase money”. Zarwar Khan died before getting an 

opportunity to record his evidence. His son, Kamil Rehman, appeared 

as DW-1 and deposed inter alia that his father had purchased the suit 

house  from  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer  on  20.12.1983  for  an  amount  of 

Rs.10,75,000/-. He produced the agreement to sell dated 20.12.1983 

as Exh.D/3. Furthermore, he deposed that  the sale consideration for 

the  suit  house  had  been  paid  by  his  father  through  a  bank  draft 

issued by Allied Bank Limited, F-7/2 Branch, Islamabad. He produced 

a copy of the said bank draft as Mark-D/1.  

18.  Respondent No.1 appeared as PW-7 and deposed inter alia that 

he had purchased the suit house from Mst. Tahira Zaheer in the year 

1983  for  an  amount  of  Rs.10,75,000/-,  out  of  which  Rs.75,000/-  was 

paid  in  cash  whereas  the  remaining  Rs.10,00,000/-  was  paid  on 

15.01.1984  through  bank  draft  No.527576  from  his  current  account 

No.744  with  Allied  Bank  Limited.  Respondent  No.1  produced  a  copy 

of  the  said  bank  draft  as  Exh.P/17  during  his  evidence,  under 

objection of the learned counsel for the appellants.  

 
 
9 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

19.  Ahmed 

Iqbal,  Manager  Operations,  Allied  Bank  Limited,  

F-7/2  Branch,  Islamabad  appeared  as  DW-2  and  deposed  inter alia 

that since the regulations of the State Bank of Pakistan require banks 

to  maintain  records  for  the  previous  five  years,  his  bank  does  not 

have the record pertaining to the year 1984.  

20.  There  is  nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that  bank  draft 

No.527576  for  an  amount  of  Rs.10,00,000/-  had  been  prepared  from 

the  funds  in  the  bank  account  of  either  respondent  No.1  or  Zarwar 

Khan.  Other  than  the  production  of  a  copy  of  the  said  bank  draft  by 

respondent 

No.1 

as 

Exh.P/17, 

and 

by  

DW-1/Kamil  Rehman  as  Mark-D/1,  there  is  no  other  corroborative 

documentary evidence to show that the said bank draft was made at 

the instance and from the funds of either respondent No.1 or Zarwar 

Khan.  There  is  also  no  receipt  of  the  sale  consideration  on  the 

record.  

21.  Zafarullah  Khan,  Upper  Division  Clerk,  Estate  Management 

Directorate, C.D.A. appeared as PW-1 and deposed inter alia that the 

suit  house  was  transferred  on  10.04.1984  to  respondent  No.1.  He 

produced  a  copy  of  the  transfer  letter  as  Exh.P/1.  He  also  deposed 

that  respondent  No.1  had  deposited  the  transfer  fee  with  respect  to 

the  suit  house.  He  produced  the  application  for  the  transfer  of  the 

suit  house  as  Exh.P/2.  PW-1  was  not  cross-examined.  Vide  order 

dated 12.02.2015, the right to cross-examine PW-1 was closed by the 

learned Civil Court.  

22.  Vide  transfer  letter  dated  10.04.1984  (Exh.P/1)  addressed  by 

the Estate Management Directorate, C.D.A. to Mst. Tahira Zaheer and 

copied  to  respondent  No.1,  the  suit  house  was  transferred  to 

respondent  No.1.  The  said  transfer  letter  makes  reference  to  Mst. 

Tahira Zaheer’s transfer application which was produced by PW-1 as 

Exh.P/2.  The  content  of  the  said  transfer  application  is  a  clear 

acknowledgment  by  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer  that  the  sale  consideration 

for  the  suit  house  was  paid  to  her  by  respondent  No.1.  For  the 

purposes  of clarity,  this  acknowledgment on her  behalf  in  Exh.P/2 is 

reproduced herein below:- 

“I was allotted by CDA plot No.24, Street No.E-7, Sector E-7, Islamabad 
measuring 1153.33 square yards vide allotment order No.CDA/EM-24/E-

 
 
10 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

7/75/8445, dated 26.03.1982, I have now decided to transfer the said 
plot to Haji Rehman Bangash son of Haji Noor War Khan aged about 23 
years, resident of V+PO Dohba Teh Hungu Kohat from whom I have 
received the entire amount paid by me to the CDA on account of price 
premium of the plot and who has agreed to abide by all the terms and 
conditions of allotment and to pay the transfer fee as prescribed by CDA 
and other dues payable by me in respect of the said plot.” 
(Emphasis added)  

23.  Since  PW-1  was  not  cross-examined  and  no  objection  was 

taken on behalf of any of Zarwar Khan’s legal heirs when Exh.P/1 and 

Exh.P/2 were produced  by  PW-1,  the contents  of  Exh.P/2  (which  is  a 

public document) are ample proof that the sale consideration for the 

suit house was paid to Mst. Tahira Zaheer by respondent No.1. There 

is  no  other  document  executed  contemporaneously  with  Exh.P/2  to 

show that the sale consideration was in fact paid by Zarwar Khan so 

as to contradict the contents of Exh.P/2. 

24.  The contesting parties did not produce Mst. Tahira Zaheer, who 

would  have  been  in  the  best  position  to  state  as  to  from  whom  she 

had  received  the  sale  consideration.  It  may  be  mentioned  that 

respondent  No.1  had,  on  13.05.2002,  filed  an  application  before  the 

learned Civil Court under Order XXVI C.P.C. for the appointment of a 

local  commission  to  record  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer’s  evidence.  The  said 

application  was  dismissed  as  withdrawn  on  15.01.2003.  Years  later, 

on  14.03.2015,  respondent  No.1 

filed  an  application 

for  the 

appointment  of  a  local  commission  to  record  the  evidence  of  Mst. 

Tahira  Zaheer’s  husband,  Mr.  Zaheer  Ahmed  Qureshi.  Vide  order 

dated  30.03.2015,  the 

learned  Civil  Court  dismissed  the  said 

application  on  the  ground  that  respondent  No.1  had  earlier 

withdrawn  his  application 

for 

the  appointment  of 

the 

local 

commission  for  the  recording  of  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer’s  evidence. 

Respondent No.1 did not assail the said order dated 30.03.2015.  

25.  Since the burden was on Zarwar Khan and/or his legal heirs to 

prove that the said transaction was benami in nature, a safe mode to 

discharge this burden was for them to have called Mst. Tahira Zaheer 

as a witness so that she could testify that she had in fact entered into 

the  transaction  with  Zarwar  Khan  and  that  it  was  from  him  that  she 

had  received  the  sale  consideration.  This,  Zarwar  Khan  and/or  his 

legal  heirs,  did  not  do.  They  did  not  even  produce  the  witnesses  to 

 
 
 
11 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

the  agreement  to  sell  dated  20.12.1983.  Due  to  this  omission,  the 

acknowledgment  in  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer’s  above-mentioned  transfer 

application (Exh.P/2)  as to the receipt of the sale  consideration from 

respondent  No.1  remained  un-rebutted.  In  the  case  of  Abdul  Ghani 

VS Muhammad Shafi (1991 CLC 1706), one of the reasons why a suit 

filed  by  the  respondent  asserting  to  be  the  beneficial  owner  of  a 

property  did  not  succeed  was  because  the  vendor  had  not  been 

produced to give evidence in support of the respondent’s stance. 

26. 

In  view  of 

the  above, 

it  cannot  be  held 

that 

the 

plaintiffs/appellants  in  the  suit  for  declaration  etc.  (Suit  No.90/2006) 

had  discharged  their  onus  of  proving  that  the  sale  consideration  for 

the suit house had been paid by them and not by respondent No.1.     

27. 

It is not disputed that a house was constructed on the plot sold 

by  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer.  Kamil  Rehman  (DW-1),  in  his  examination-in-

chief, deposed that on 04.06.1984, an agreement for the construction 

of a house  on  the suit property was  executed between  Zarwar Khan 

and  one  Bashir  Ahmad.  Kamil  Rehman  produced  the  construction 

agreement  dated  04.06.1984  (Exh.D/1)  executed  between  Zarwar 

Khan  and  Bashir  Ahmad  (Contractor).  Muhammad  Ali  (PW-8),  who 

was Bashir Ahmad’s son, had identified his father’s signatures on the 

said construction  agreement.  The said agreement was witnessed by 

Salar  Abdul  Ghani  and  a  second  witness  whose  name  cannot  be 

deciphered  from  his  signature.  The  stamp  paper  on  which  the  said 

agreement (Exh.D/1) was executed and was issued on 04.06.1984 for 

an  agreement  between  Bashir  Ahmad  and  respondent  No.1.  Kamil 

Rehman/DW-1,  in  his  cross-examination,  deposed  that  one  of  the 

witnesses namely Salar Abdul Ghani had passed away. He chose not 

to produce the second witness in order to prove the execution of the 

said agreement. Therefore, it can safely be held that the execution of 

the said agreement was not proved in accordance with Section 68 of 

the Evidence Act, 1872. It ought to be borne in mind that the Qanun-e-

Shahadat Order, 1984, Article 79 whereof requires such a document 

to  be  proved  by  producing  two  attesting  witnesses  had  come  into 

force  on  26.10.1984,  i.e.  after  the  alleged  execution  of  the  said 

construction agreement.  

 
 
12 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

28.  The  architect  of  the  suit  house  was  M/s  Saeed  Associates 

Consulting  Architects.  Kamil  Rehman  (DW-1)  produced  Exh.D/4 

which is an agreement executed between  Zarwar Khan and the said 

firm for drawing up the design for the suit house. The said agreement 

was  signed  by  Chaudhary  Muhammad  Saeed,  Chief  Architect  on 

behalf of the said firm. Chaudhry Muhammad Saeed did not appear as 

a witness on account of having gone abroad. Sohail Ghias Khan, who 

was Auto Operator in said firm, appeared as PW-3 and produced the 

design  map  of  the  suit  house  as  Mark-A  and  the  receipt  for  the 

payment  of  architect’s  fee  as  Mark-B.  PW-3  deposed  that  the 

architect’s fee had been paid by respondent No.1 and in this regard, 

a receipt for Rs.10,000/- was produced as Mark-B.  

29.  Respondent No.1 (PW-7) had deposed that he had provided the 

funds  for  the  construction  by  transferring  them  through  hundi  from 

Qatar.  In  support  of  this  stance,  respondent  No.1  produced  his 

diaries  as  Exh.P7/1-50.  The  said  diaries  show  entries  of  various 

payments  made  to  Bashir  Ahmad  whose  signatures  also  appear  on 

the  entries.  Bashir  Ahmad’s  son,  Muhammad  Ali  (PW-8),  had  also 

identified his father’s signatures on the said entries.  

30.  Respondent  No.1,  in  his  examination-in-chief,  produced  note 

books (Exh.P/7 and P/8)  containing the expenses  incurred by him on 

the  construction  of  the  suit  house.  Although  the  construction 

contractor  had  died  and  therefore  could  not  be  produced  as  a 

witness,  his  son  Muhammad  Ali  appeared  as  PW-8 and  identified  his 

father’s signatures on the note books as Exh.P/1 to 50.  

31.  PW-3’s  testimony  that  the  architect’s  fee  had  been  paid  by 

respondent  No.1  and  identification  by  PW-8  of  his  father’s  signature 

on  the  note  books  produced  by  respondent  No.1  lead  credence  to 

respondent  No.1’s  position  that  he  had  paid  for  the  construction  of 

the suit house.  

The nature and possession of the property after the purchase:-  

32. 

It  is  an  admitted  position  that  presently  possession  of  the  suit 

house is with Zarwar Khan’s sons. Kamil Rehman/DW-1, in his cross-

examination, deposed that since 1998 he  is in possession of the  suit 

house.  Respondent  No.1  had  also  deposed  that  Zarwar  Khan  had 

 
 
 
  
13 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

taken possession of the suit house in January 1998. In  view of these 

depositions,  respondent  No.1  has  not  been  in  possession  of  the  suit 

house since the past twenty years. 

33.  Certificate of possession dated 16.04.1984 (Exh.D/11) issued by 

the  C.D.A.  shows  that  possession  of  the  suit  property  had  been 

handed  over  to  respondent  No.1.  The  notice  of  completion  dated 

15.01.1987  (Exh.D/12)  had  been  issued  by  respondent  No.1  to  the 

C.D.A.  These  documents  are  evidence  of  the  fact  that  after  the 

purchase of the plot from Mst. Tahira Zaheer and the construction of 

a  house  thereon,  its  possession  had  been  with  respondent  No.1.  It 

may,  however,  be  mentioned  that  these  documents  were  not 

produced  by  respondent  No.1/PW-7  but  by  the  learned  counsel  for 

respondent No1. It now needs to be determined how respondent No.1 

lost  possession  of  the  suit  house  to  Zarwar  Khan  and/or  the 

appellants.  

34. 

 Zarwar Khan, in his suit for declaration etc. (Suit No.90/2006), 

pleaded that possession of the suit house was handed over to him by 

the  C.D.A.  and  that  the  certificate  of  possession  No.1351,  dated 

16.04.1984,  was  in  his  possession.  Furthermore  in  paragraphs  10 to 

13 of the said suit, it was pleaded that the suit house had been leased 

out  on  01.03.1989  to  the  Military  Liaison  Officer  of  the  United  Arab 

Emirates  for  a  monthly  rent  of  Rs.30,000/-;  that  on  14.04.1994,  the 

suit house was rented out to Mrs. Margaret Kyenkya from UNICEF for 

a  period  of  three  years;  and  that  on  22.05.1996,  the  suit  house  had 

been rented out to Mr. Paul Medhurst, Security Officer, UNMOGIP.   

35.  Respondent  No.1,  in  his  written  statement,  pleaded  inter alia 

that after the completion of the construction of the suit house, he had 

been  residing  in  the  same  along  with  his  family,  and  after  he  went 

abroad, his wife and children continued to live there until they shifted 

to live with Zarwar Khan. Respondent No.1, in his written statement, 

admitted that the suit house was rented out by Zarwar Khan with his 

consent  and  upon his  return from  abroad,  Zarwar  Khan  had  handed 

over  the  rent  to  respondent  No.1.  In  view  of  the  said  admission,  the 

execution of the lease agreements executed by Zarwar Khan with the 

tenants between 1989 and 1996 (Exh.D/5 to Exh.D/9) does not need to 

 
 
14 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

be  proved.  Furthermore,  it  was  pleaded  by  respondent  No.1  that 

legal notice dated  10.09.1997 (Mark-C) was sent on his behalf to  the 

tenant  intimating  to  the  latter  that  the  house  in  his  occupation  is 

without consent of respondent No.1. Perusal of the said notice shows 

that  thereby  respondent  No.1  required  the  tenant,  Mr.  Medhurst,  to 

pay  rent  to  him  and  not  anybody  else.  In  paragraph  6  of  the  suit  for 

possession etc., respondent No.1 pleaded inter alia that on the expiry 

of the lease, possession of the suit property had been handed over by 

the said tenant to Zarwar Khan. In respondent No.1's examination-in-

chief, Zarwar Khan is said to have trespassed and taken possession 

of the  same  after the tenant vacated  the suit house.  Moreover, legal 

notice  dated  04.03.1995  (Mark-B)  is  said  to  have  been  served  on 

Zarwar  Khan  calling  upon  him  to  hand  over  possession  of  the  suit 

house  to  respondent  No.1.  On  21.03.1998,  respondent  No.1  filed  a 

suit for possession against Zarwar Khan and his sons.  

36.  Kamil  Rehman  (DW-1)  deposed  inter alia    that  the  suit  house 

was  rented  out  by  this  father  to  different  tenants  through  lease 

agreements produced as Exh.D/5 to Exh.D/9. The period during which 

the rent agreements were executed was from 1989 to 1996. The lease 

agreement  dated  22.05.1996  (Exh.D/9) was  executed  between  Kamil 

Rehman and Mr. Paul Medhurst, Security Officer, UNMOGIP. 

37.  Respondent No.1 appeared as PW-7 and deposed  in his cross-

examination  that  he  had  lived  in  the  suit  house  for  a  period  of  nine 

years, and that after he proceeded to Qatar in the year 1995, his wife 

and  children  moved  to  live  with  Zarwar  Khan.  Respondent  No.1  did 

not depose as to whom he handed over possession of the suit house 

after he proceeded abroad and his wife and children moved out of the 

suit  house.  Respondent  No.1,  in  his  written  statement  to  Zarwar 

Khan’s suit, did not clearly deny the fact that the said house had been 

given  on  rent  from  1989  to  1996.  Respondent  No.1  deposed  that  he 

came to know in the year 1996 that  Zarwar Khan had rented out the 

suit house to a foreigner for an amount of Rs.70,000/-.  

38.  Now,  since  the  construction  of  the  suit  house  was  admittedly 

completed  in  1987,  the  nine-year  period  during  which  respondent 

No.1  claims  to  have  lived  in  the  suit  house  would  end  in  1996. 

 
 
15 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

Respondent  No.1’s  testimony  belies  his  own  pleadings.  Respondent 

No.1’s  admission  in  his  written  statement  that  between  1989  and 

1996, the suit house was rented out with his consent and that he had 

also been paid the rent is a negation of his testimony that he lived in 

the suit house for nine years and went abroad in the year 1995 after 

which  his  wife  and  children  moved  to  live  with  Zarwar  Khan.  On  the 

one  hand,  respondent  No.1  deposes  that  the  possession  of  the  suit 

house  fell  in  the  hands  of  Zarwar  Khan  in  the  year  1995  when 

respondent No.1 went abroad and on  the other hand, he pleads that 

for the period between 1989 to 1996, the suit house was given on rent 

by  Zarwar  Khan  with  respondent  No.1’s  consent  and  that  the  latter 

had received the rent for the said period. This material contradiction 

renders  respondent  No.1’s  testimony  on  this  question  unbelievable. 

Yet  another  contradiction  in  respondent  No.1’s  case  is  that  in  his 

cross-examination,  he  deposed  that  prior  to  the  suit  house  having 

been given on rent to Mr. Paul Medhurst, respondent No.1’s wife and 

children lived in the suit house.         

39. 

It is when a litigant tries to build his case on a false premise that 

such contradictions in his testimony develop. Is this Court to believe 

respondent No.1 when he says that he lived in the suit house for nine 

years after its completion in 1987 or that between 1989 and 1996, the 

suit  house  was  rented  out  by  Zarwar  Khan  with  his  consent?  These 

positions  taken  by  respondent  No.1  are  contradictory  and  mutually 

exclusive.  Be  that  as  it  may,  the  long  and  short  of  this  is  that 

respondent  No.1  has  not  been  able  to  prove  that  he  was  in 

possession of the suit house at all material times after 1987 when the 

construction of the suit house was completed.  

Motive if any, for giving the transaction a benami complexion:- 

40.  The  motive  on  the  part  of  the  person  who  claims  to  have 

advanced  the  sale  consideration  plays  an 

important  role 

in 

determining  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  No  motive  for  having 

purchased the suit house in respondent No.1’s name was pleaded by 

Zarwar  Khan  in  the  suit  declaration,  etc.  filed  by  him  as  well  as  the 

written statement to the suit filed by respondent No.1. Zarwar Khan’s 

son,  Kamil  Rehman,  appeared  as  DW-1  and  in  his  examination-in-

 
 
 
16 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

chief, deposed inter alia that although the motive for purchasing the 

suit property in respondent No.1’s name has not been pleaded in the 

suit,  the  said  property  was  purchased  in  respondent  No.1’s  name 

because Zarwar Khan’s wife and children were abroad. Furthermore, 

it  was  deposed  that  no  document  was  executed  to  show  that  the 

purchase of the suit house in respondent No.1’s name was a benami 

transaction. "Mutual confidence, faith warm and cordial relationship" 

between  Zarwar  Khan  and  respondent  No.1  could  hardly  constitute 

motive to sustain a plea of benami transaction. 

41.  Since  the  suit  instituted  by  Zarwar  Khan  contains  no  pleading 

as to a plausible or a valid reason/motive for the purchase of the suit 

house  in  respondent  No.1’s  name,  the  reason  advanced  by  DW-1  in 

his evidence for the purchase of the suit house in respondent No.1’s 

name  is  not  worthy  of  any  consideration.  It  is  an  admitted  position 

that  Zarwar  Khan  was  in  Pakistan  when  the  suit  house  was 

purchased. If indeed Zarwar Khan had purchased the suit property, it 

does not appeal to reason as to why another person would be shown 

as  the  owner  of  the  suit  property.  All  this  leads  us  to  form  the  view 

that  an  essential  prerequisite  for  declaring  a  transaction  for  the 

purchase of property to be benami in nature is lacking in the case at 

hand. It is essential for the motive for the benami transaction to borne 

out  from  the  record.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  be  made  to  the 

following case law:-  

(i) 

In the case of Ghulam Murtaza VS Asia Bibi (PLD 2010 SC569), 

it has been held as follows:- 

“7.  At this juncture, we may clarify that the motive part in 
the  benami  transaction  is  the  most  important  one.  A 
transaction cannot be dubbed as benami simply because one 
person happened to make payment for or on behalf of the 
other.”  

Furthermore,  in  the  said  case,  it  was  held  that if “motive is 

available and also is reasonable and plausible, a transaction can be 

held as Benami, otherwise not”. 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Abdul  Majeed  VS  Abdul  Rasheed  (PLD  2016 

Lahore 383), the Hon'ble Lahore High Court held inter alia that 

“the absence of motive always goes against a party asserting 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

title over a property as its real owner against a party alleged to 

be an ostensible/benami owner”.   

(iii) 

In  the case of  Ansar Hussain VS  Muhammad  Karim  (2006 CLC 

732),  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  held  inter alia  that  “the 

main ingredients about the Benamiship are the motive and the 

source of money”.  

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Riaz  Mirza  VS  Muhammad  Yousaf 

Mirza (2005 YLR 2213), it was held as follows:- 

“26.  In addition to the above, it is clear from the record that 
no motive for a Benami transaction has been brought out on 
record by Muhammad Yousaf Mirza. It is by now well-settled 
that the existence of a motive for creating a Benami title is 
relevant for the purpose of determining whether title vested in 
a person is merely Benami. The absence of any motive also 
goes against Muhammad Yousaf Mirza.” 

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Rafique  VS  Khalida  Shehzadi  (2003 

CLC 559), it was held as follows:- 

“In matters where law requires a party to prove its motive for 
doing an act, failure to establish motive defeats the claim made 
by such party. Dispute regarding Benami transaction, motive 
for alienation in favour of Benamidar must be proved by the 
person claiming to be the real owner. 

(vi) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Zaman  VS  Abdul  Hamid  (2002  CLC 

1209), the Hon'ble Lahore High Court held as follows:-  

“In matters in which law requires a party to prove its motive for 
doing an act failure to establish motive would defeat the claim 
made by the party. In disputes relating to Benami transactions, 
motive for alienation in favour of a Benamidar must be proved 
by the person claiming to be the real owner”. 

The  position  of  the  parties  and  the  relationship,  if  any,  between  the 
claimant and the alleged benamidar:- 

42.  Respondent No.1 was Zarwar Khan’s nephew as well as son-in-

law.  Respondent  No.1 was  in  his  early  twenties  when  the suit  house 

was  purchased.  After  the  suit  house  was  purchased,  he  did  not 

purchase any other immovable property in Islamabad. The mere fact 

that respondent No.1 was young when the suit house was purchased 

would  not  ipso facto  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  he  was  only  an 

ostensible owner and that Zarwar Khan was the real owner.  There is 

no  evidence  as  to  the  existence  of  circumstances  showing  that 

Zarwar Khan could not purchase the suit house in his own name and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

was compelled to purchase the same in respondent No.1’s name. If it 

is  assumed  for  the  sake  of  argument  that  Zarwar  Khan  was  the  real 

owner of the suit house, it does not appeal to reason as to why he did 

not transfer the suit house in his own name between 1984 (when the 

suit house was purchased from Mst. Tahira Zaheer) and 1998 (when 

respondent No.1 instituted the suit for possession  of the suit house). 

There  is  nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that  there  was  any 

impediment  or  hurdle  before  Zarwar  Khan  in  transferring  the  suit 

property in his own name. Additionally, there is nothing on the record 

to  suggest  that  there  was  an  agreement  or  understanding  between 

respondent  No.1  and  Zarwar  Khan  that  the  latter  was  to  be  the  real 

owner  of  the  suit  house.  Zarwar  Khan  had  several  years  after  the 

purchase  of the  suit  house  to  have executed  such  an  understanding 

with 

respondent  No.1.  The  absence  of  such  an  express 

understanding  would  go  to  respondent  No.1’s  benefit.  Reference  in 

his regard may be made to the following case law:-  

(i) 

In the case  of Ghulam Rasool VS Nusrat Rasool (PLD 2008 SC 

146), it was held as follows:- 

“[T]wo essential elements must exist to establish the benami status 
of the transaction. The first element is that there must be  an 
agreement express or implied between the ostensible owner and the 
purchaser for purchase of the property in the name of ostensible 
owner for the benefit of the person who has to make payment of the 
consideration and second element required to be proved is that 
transaction was actually entered between the real purchaser and 
seller to which ostensible owner was not party”. 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Bilqees  Begum  VS  Registrar  of  Properties  (PLD 

2006 Karachi 617), it was held as follows:- 

“A transaction can be recognized and declared as benami only if 
there is clear agreement or express understanding in that respect 
between the person who claims to be purchaser as owner and the 
person  in  whose  favour  the  property  was  purchased.  That 
agreement should be clear to the extent that the property was in fact 
owned by the person having paid the price thereof and not by the 
person in whose name it has been purchased”. 

Law  to  the  said  effect  has  also  been  laid  down  in  the  case  of 

Muhammad Arif VS Waheed-ul-Haq (2017 YLR 224).  

43.  Respondent  No.1,  during  his  evidence,  had  produced  an 

affidavit (Exh.PW1/X-1) sworn by his father, Haji Noorwar Khan. In the 

said  affidavit,  it  was  deposed inter alia  that  a  four-storey  building  in 

 
 
 
 
 
19 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

Peshawar  called  “Doha Palace”  was  beneficially  owned  by  Zarwar 

Khan  whereas  the  deponent/Haji  Noorwar  Khan  was  only 

its 

ostensible/benami owner. No plausible explanation was advanced by 

the  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  for  having  produced  the 

said  document.  If  the  intention  behind  producing  the  said  document 

was that it was a practice between Haji Zarwar Khan and his brother, 

Haji Noorwar Khan, or his children to enter into benami transaction, 

this would be fatal to respondent No.1’s case. Be that as it may, if the 

affidavit sworn by respondent No.1’s father is true, it would show that 

it  was  a  practice  by  Zarwar  Khan  to  purchase  properties  in  the 

names of his relatives.  

The custody of the title-deeds after the transaction:- 

44.  Since  the  suit  house  is  located  in  the  developed  sector  of 

Islamabad, the transfer/allotment letter issued by the C.D.A. in favour 

of its owner would be considered as the title document. Zarwar Khan, 

in his suit for declaration etc., did not specifically  plead that he is in 

possession of such a transfer/allotment letter. He, however, did plead 

that the original owner of the suit house, namely Mst. Tahira Zaheer, 

had  handed  him  over  the  original  documents  pertaining  to  the  suit 

house.  What  is  of  importance  in  a  suit  praying  for  a  declaration  that 

the transaction for the purchase of property is benami in nature is for 

the  plaintiff  not  just  to  plead  that  he  is  in  possession  of  the  title 

document but also to produce the same in his evidence. 

45.  The  title  document  with  respect  to  the  suit  house  is  letter 

No.CDA/EM/E-7/24/75,  dated  10.04.1984,  whereby  the  allotment  of 

the  suit  house  was  transferred  from  Mst.  Tahira  Zaheer  to 

respondent  No.1.  This  document  was  produced  by  Zarwar  Khan’s 

learned  counsel  as  Exh.D-18,  at  the  stage  of  the  recording  of  his 

statement.  No  explanation  was  put  forth  by  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  appellants  as  to  why  Kamil  Rehman/DW-1  did  not  produce  the 

said  transfer  letter.  Although  in  the  case  of  Muhammad  Nawaz  VS 

Shahida Perveen (PLD 2017 Islamabad 375), this Court had held that 

the  documents  cannot  be  produced  by  counsel  for  the  parties  in 

order  to  plug  the  loopholes  or  to  address  the  deficiencies  in  such 

parties’ evidence, but in the case at hand respondent No.1 admitted 

 
 
 
20 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

that  the  possession  of  the  original  transfer  letter  was  with  Zarwar 

Khan. What respondent No.1 disputes is the legality and propriety of 

the appellant’s possession of the allotment/transfer letter.  

46.  When  the  transfer/allotment  letter  was  produced  before  the 

learned Civil Court by the appellant’s counsel, an objection was taken 

by  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  that  the  said  document  had 

been  stolen  from  respondent  No.1  and  in  this  regard,  Rapt  No.8, 

dated  14.11.1997  (Mark-A/1)  was  registered  at  Police  Station, 

Margalla,  Islamabad.  The  contents  of  the  said  report  show  that 

respondent  No.1  had  taken  the  position  that  he  had  brought  the 

original  documents  to  the  lower  Courts/Kachehri  where  he  had  lost 

them.  Respondent  No.1  had  also  applied  to  the  C.D.A.  for  the 

issuance  of  a  duplicate  allotment  letter.  The  said  application  was 

accompanied  by  respondent  No.1’s  affidavit  in  which  he  deposed 

that  the  original  documents  pertaining  to  the  suit  house  had  been 

misplaced somewhere.     

47.  Respondent  No.1/PW-7’s  examination-in-chief  is  not  consistent 

with the objection taken by his learned counsel when the appellants’ 

counsel  produced  the  transfer/allotment  letter.  Respondent  No.1,  in 

his  examination-in-chief,  deposed  that  the  original  documents  were 

present in the suit house  and since respondent No.1 had proceeded 

abroad,  they  came  into  Zarwar  Khan’s  possession.  It  was  also 

deposed  that  despite  repeated  reminders,  Zarwar  Khan  had  not 

given  these  original  documents  to  respondent  No.1.  Respondent 

No.1,  in  his  cross-examination,  also  deposed  that  in  the  year  1995 

when  Zarwar  Khan  took  possession  of  the  suit  house,  he  also 

snatched 

)یل  نیھچ(

the  file  pertaining  to  the  suit  house,  and  that 

respondent  No.1  in  this  regard  lodged  a  criminal  compliant  (Mark-

PW-7/A1).  Respondent  No.1  clarified  that  although  a  criminal 

complaint  had  been  filed  regarding  the  allotment/transfer  letter 

having  been  lost  but  after  coming  to  know  that  the  same  was  in 

Zarwar Khan’s possession, he did not pursue the criminal complaint 

and  verbally  requested  Zarwar  Khan  to  return  the  said  document. 

However, on 13.11.2016, respondent No.1 filed an application before 

the  D.S.P.,  Islamabad  praying  for  legal  action  to  be  taken  against 

 
 
 
 
21 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

Zarwar  Khan’s  sons  for  having  stolen  the  documents  pertaining  to 

the suit house. In the case of S. Iqbal Ahmad VS Jawaid Iqbal (2011 

CLC  29),  the  title  documents  of  the  property  in  question  in  the  said 

case were held to be with the plaintiff since the defendant had lodged 

an  F.I.R.,  wherein  it  was  alleged  that  the  title  documents  had  been 

taken away by the plaintiff. 

48.  Respondent  No.1’s  stance,  in  his  examination-in-chief,  is  not 

even consistent with his stance in his cross-examination inasmuch as 

on  the  one  hand  he  takes  the  position  that  when  he  went  abroad  in 

1995, the allotment/transfer letter came in Zarwar Khan’s possession 

and on the other hand, he asserts that Zarwar Khan had snatched the 

allotment/transfer letter from him.  In the case of Abdus Samad Khan 

VS  Abdullah  (1989  CLC  1563),  the  party/defendant  alleged  to  be  an 

ostensible/benami  owner  of  the  property  in  question  had  given 

contradictory  evidence  with  respect  to  the  possession  of  the  title 

documents pertaining to such property. He had deposed in his cross-

examination  that  he  could  not  produce  the  documents  pertaining  to 

the  house  in  dispute  because  he  had  misplaced  them.  He  had  also 

accused 

the  plaintiff  of  having  stolen 

the  documents.  This 

contradiction in the defendant’s evidence was one of the reasons for 

decreeing  the  suit  instituted  by  the  plaintiff  claiming  to  be  the  real 

owner of the property in question.   

49. 

It  may  be  noted  that  respondent  No.1,  in  his  written  statement 

to  Zarwar  Khan’s  suit  for  declaration,  etc.  (Suit  No.90/2006)  had 

pleaded  inter alia  that  since  after  he  returned  to  Pakistan,  he  was 

unable to locate the papers relating to the suit house, he published an 

advertisement 

in  the  newspaper  and 

lodged  a  report 

in  the 

concerned police station. It may also be noted that respondent No.1, 

in  his  suit  for  possession,  had  not  pleaded  that  he  had  lost  the 

transfer/allotment letter or that it was stolen from him or that Zarwar 

Khan  had  snatched  it  from  him  or  that  he  had  lodged  a  criminal 

complaint.    Since  respondent  No.1’s  testimony  that  Zarwar  Khan 

snatched  or  had  stolen  the  allotment/transfer  letter  from  him  is  in 

derogation  of  respondent  No.1’s  pleadings,  such  testimony  is  not 

worthy  of  any  consideration.  The  Superior  Courts  have  time  and 

 
 
22 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

again indicated that no party should be permitted to travel beyond its 

pleadings  and  that  all  necessary  and  material  facts  should  be 

pleaded  by  the  party  in  support  of  the  case  set  up  by  it.  It  is  also 

settled  law  that  parties  are  bound  by  the  pleadings.  Pleadings  are 

treated as a foundation of a case especially in civil matters and a fact 

having not been pleaded cannot be allowed to be taken or agitated at 

a  subsequent  stage.  The  maxim  "secundum allegata et probata" 

(according  to  what  is  alleged  and  proved) can be  aptly  pressed  into 

service here. 

50.  A  conjoint  study  of  (i)  respondent  No.1’s  evidence,  (ii) 

respondent  No.1's  pleadings,  (iii)  objection  taken  on  behalf  of 

respondent  No.1  (when  the  allotment/transfer  letter  (Exh.D-18)  was 

produced  by  the  appellants’  learned  counsel),  and  (iv)  respondent 

No.1’s  application  to  the  C.D.A.  for  the  issuance  of  a  duplicate 

allotment letter, shows that respondent No.1’s stance regarding how 

he  lost  possession  of  the  allotment/transfer  letter  is  contradictory. 

These  contradictions  render  respondent  No.1’s  stance  unreliable 

before  a  Court  exercising  equitable 

jurisdiction.  Since 

in  the 

proceedings  before  the  learned  Trial  Court  the  original  allotment 

letter  (Exh.D-18)  did  not  come  from  respondent  No.1’s  possession, 

and since respondent No.1’s  stance  as to  how he lost possession of 

the  allotment  letter  is  contradictory  and  unconvincing,  it  would  be 

safe to hold that  possession of the title document/transfer letter  had 

remained  with  the  appellants.  The  discharge  of  the  onus  by  the 

appellants  that  the  title  document  was  in  Zarwar  Khan's  possession 

is  not,  by  itself,  sufficient  to  declare  transaction  for  the  purchase  of 

the suit house as benami. 

51.  The agreement to  sell dated 20.12.1983 (Exh.D/3)  is  the first in 

the  series  of  documents  with  respect  to  the  transaction  for  the 

purchase  of  the  suit  house.  Although  the  parties  to  this  agreement 

are Mst. Tahira Zaheer and respondent No.1, but this document was 

produced  by  Kamil  Rehman/DW-1  in  his  examination-in-chief.  The 

objection  taken  by  the  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  to  the 

production  of  the  said  document  was  that  it  had  not  been  executed 

with  Zarwar  Khan.  Indeed,  Zarwar  Khan  was  not  a  party  to  the  said 

 
 
23 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

agreement  but  it  was  tendered  in  evidence  by  his  son,  i.e.  Kamil 

Rehman/DW-1.  There  is  no  testimony  or  explanation  by  respondent 

No.1  as  to  how  he  had  lost  possession  of  the  said  document. 

Although Exh.D/3 is not a title document regarding the suit house, but 

it is a document of crucial importance in a suit for declaration where 

title  to  a  property  is  asserted  by  a  real  owner  against  an  ostensible 

owner, and where  the real  owner’s possession of the  title document 

is alleged by the ostensible owner to be unlawful and improper.   

The  conduct  of  the  parties  concerned  in  dealing  with  the  property 
after the sale:- 

52.  As  mentioned  above,  respondent  No.1 

is  Zarwar  Khan’s 

nephew  as  well  as  his  son-in-law.  Differences  and  disputes  between 

Zarwar  Khan  and  respondent  No.1  arose  when  the  suit  for 

possession was filed by the latter on 21.03.1998. It was after the filing 

of  the  said  suit  that  Zarwar  Khan,  on  30.11.1998,  filed  a  suit  for 

declaration and permanent injunction against respondent No.1.  

53.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  admitted  that  between 

1989  and  1996,  the  suit  house  used  to  be  given  on  rent  by  Zarwar 

Khan  and/or  his  sons  with  respondent  No.1’s  consent.  Respondent 

No.1  also  asserts  that  after  he  returned  from  abroad  the  rent  was 

paid to him. He, however, takes the position that in the year 1996, the 

suit house was given to Mr. Paul Medhurst without his consent. It was 

not  until  1998  that  respondent  No.1  filed  the  suit  for  possession. 

Respondent No.1 contradicted himself by deposing that he along with 

his family lived in the suit house until 1995 whereafter he went aboard 

and his family moved in with Zarwar Khan. Although there are far too 

many  contradictions  between  respondent  No.1’s  pleadings  and 

evidence  but  the  weaknesses  in  his  case  would  not  have  the 

consequence of decreeing  Zarwar  Khan’s  suit for declaration  to the 

effect that the latter was the beneficial owner of the suit  property. In 

the  case  of  Muhammad  Sajjad  Hussain  VS  Muhammad  Anwar 

Hussain (1991 SCMR 703), it was held inter alia that the initial burden 

of  proof  is  on  the  party  who  alleges  that  an  ostensible  owner  is  a 

benamidar  for  him.  It  was  also  held  that  the  weaknesses  in  the 

defence  evidence  would  not  relieve  a  plaintiff  from  discharging  the 

burden of proof on him. 

 
 
  
24 

R.F.As.No.09, 08 & 14/2017 

54.  The  above  discussion  leads  us  to  the  conclusion  that  the 

appellants were able to establish that they were in possession of the 

suit house as well as the title documents pertaining to the suit house. 

However, they were unable to prove that  Zarwar Khan had provided 

the funds for the purchase of the suit house, and motive for entering 

into a benami transaction.  

55.  As  regards  the  quantum  of  compensation  held  by  the  learned 

Civil Court to be payable to respondent No.1 between 1998 and until 

he gets possession of the suit house, learned counsel for respondent 

No.1  was  unable  to  convince  us  that  such  compensation  was  in  any 

manner inadequate. Consequently, all the appeals are dismissed with 

no order as to costs.
