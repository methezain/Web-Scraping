3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner  submitted 

that  prosecution 

case 

is 

highly  doubtful, 

discrepant, bogus and lacks tangible  evidence; that 

the  offence  does  not  fall  within  the  ambit  of 

prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497  Cr.P.C.  that 

petitioner is not convicted in any criminal case and 

that  prosecution  case  needs  further  probe  into the 

matter. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  A.A.G.  assisted 

by  learned  State  counsel  vehemently  opposed  the 

grant  of bail to  the  petitioner.  The  complainant  is 

also present in person before the Court and submits 

that she has no objection if the petitioner is granted 

in the instant case. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Tentative  assessment  of  the  record  shows 

that the petitioner allegedly with malafide intention 

and  criminal  motive  illegally  and  unauthorizedly 

captured/  recorded  her  personal  pictures  and 

videos  for  charming  her  for  marriage  and  further 

uploaded,  generated  and  transmitted  her  private 

pictures 

from  whatsApp  Mobile  Phone  of 

complainant's  sister  Ms.  Aiza  Khatoon  and  her 

friend  Ms.  Sadaf  Tanveer  and  further  transmitted 

indecent, vulgar, unethical, defamatory, derogatory 

and  sexually  explicit  speech/  narration,  messages 

from his mobile phone  and disgraced  her  amongst 

her  family,  friends  and  relatives  and  spoiled  her 

modesty. 

7. 

The  complainant  appeared  in  person  before 

this  Court  and  made  a  statement  that  she has  not 

objection  if  the  petitioner  is  admitted  to  bail. 

Further,  offence  under  section  509,  109, PPC  and 

3 

CR.MISC.  N0.791-B  12019 

section 20 &  21  PECA,  2016,  does not  fall within 

the prohibitory clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. 

8. 

In  view  of  the  circumstances  mentioned 

above,  case  of  petitioner,  prima facie,  becomes 

that of further inquiry covered by subsection (2) of 

section  497  Cr.P.C.  This  petition  is  allowed  and 

petitioner  is  admitted to post  arrest  bail  subject to 

furnishing  bail  bonds  in  the  sum  of Rs.2,00,000/  

(two lac) with one surety in the  like amount to the 

satisfaction of learned Trial Court. 

9. 

The  observations  made  above  are  tentative 

in  nature  and  are  strictly  confined  to  the  decision 

of this bail petition only.
