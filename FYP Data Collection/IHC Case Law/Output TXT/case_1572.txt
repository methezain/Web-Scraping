Complainant In person. 

This 

is  post-arrest  bail  petition  by 

accused-petitioner 

(Naqeeb Ullah)  in  case  FIR 

No.357,  dated  04.08.2019,  under  Sections 

392/411  PPC,  Police  Station  Golra  Sharif, 

Islamabad. 

2. 

Briefly,  the allegations  set forth  in the FIR 

are  that,  on  27.07.2019,  at  about  11:30  p.m. 

when the  complainant  along with  his family  was 

present  in  his  house  situated  In  Sector  G-13/4, 

Islamabad,  his  nephew  opened  the  door  in 

response  to  a  door-bell,  some  persons,  two 

armed with  pistols,  entered  the house and made 

them  hostage;  that  the  assailants  comnntted 

robbery  of  articles  and  cash,  detail  of  which  is 

mentioned 

in 

the  FIR  and  also 

took 

the 

complainant  to the nearby bank and by using his 

ATM card,  withdrew  an amount of Rs.50,000/-. 

3. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

contends 

that  accused/petitioner 

is  not 

nominated  in  the  FIR,  there  is  delay  of  seven 

days  in  lodging  the  FIR; that  there  is  a general 

allegation  against  some  unknown  persons  and 

Criminal  Misc.  No.a17-B/  202Q 

-2- 

no  specific  role  has  been  attributed 

to  the 

petitioner;  he is behind the bars since arrest and 

no  identification  parade  has  been  conducted. 

Learned counsel  in support  of  his submissions, 

placed  reliance  upon  case  laws  reported  as 

2010  YLR 2129, 2006 PCr.LJ 631, 2010 PCr.LJ  1460, 

2016 MLD  1103, 2010 MLD  1768, 2018 PCr.LJ Note 

28 and 2011 PCr.LJ  1667. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand, 

learned  State 

Counsel argued that  recovery  of  looted  amount 

was effected  from  the  petitioner;  that  petitioner 

is  involved  in  seven other  cases  of  like  nature; 

the complainant also identified  him at the time of 

identification  of  his  articles;  offence  alleged  is 

heinous  and  cannot  be  taken  lightly  and  that 

challan  has  been  submitted  and  trial 

is  in 

progress,  therefore,  petitioner  is not entitled  to 

the concession of bail. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record  perused. 

As far  as delay of seven days in lodging 

the  FIR is concerned,  apparently  the  same had 

been  sufficiently  explained  by  the  complainant 

and yet, if any impact of the same is on the case, 

that is function  of the trial  Court to consider  it at 

trial  stage and merely on this ground bail cannot 

be  allowed.  In  like  case,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  Judgment reported  as 

lffazhar Iqbal  V.  The State and another (2010 

SCMR 1171) has enunciated  a  law,  the  learned 

High  Court  granted  bail  but  the  same  was 

cancelled  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan not considering  the delay sufficient  for 

grant  of  bail.  In  paragraph  No.3  of  the  said 

judgment  it was held that:- 

Criminal  Misc.  No.917Â·8/  2Q20 

-3- 

"In the  present  case the  explanation of the 
delay  in  lodging  the  FIR, furnished  by  the 
complainant  can  be  examined  by  the  trial 
Court  at  the  appropriate  stage  when  the 
evidence  is  recorded  in  the  case  and  the 
same is  also subject  to  cross  examination. 
Thus  in  the  peculiar  circumstances  of  the 
instant 
deeper 
appreciation  of  the  evidence  which  cannot 
be undertaken at this stage." 

require 

case, 

this 

7. 

The  police  had 

recovered 

looted 

amount of Rs.3000/- and 30$ connected with the 

occurrence 

from 

the  petitioner  and 

this 

recovery,  prima  facie,  connects  the  petitioner 

with  the  commission  of  alleged  offence.  The 

Hon'ble  Apex  Court  in  case  Shoukat  Ali  alias 

Shoka  V.  The State(2004  SCMR 1068) held that:- 

"that  a  recovery  of  cash  amount  has  also 
been effected  from him. Although,  It Is said 
by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 
that  the cash amount did  not  belong  to the 
complainant.  An  affidavit  has  also  been 
submitted  to  state  that  petitioner  was  a 
desperate person."

The petitioner  has criminal  record  and 

the  details  of  cases registered  against  him are 

as under:-

The  aspect  of 

recovery  of 

looted 

amount  and 

the  alleged 

involvement  of 

petitioner  in  seven other  cases  of  like  nature, 

cannot  be  overlooked.  In  this  respect  I  am 

guided  by the  law  adjudicated  by this  Court  in 

case  titled  Ameer  Hamza  V.  The State  and 

others  (2017  PCr.LJ  21)  wherein  it  is  held  in 

paragraph 8 as under:- 

" The nature of the offence, the recovery  of 
the  material 
the  official  motorcycle, 
collected  by  the  prosecution  and  alleged 
involvement of  the  petitioner  in  ten  other 
registered  criminal  cases has been rightly 
made  the  basis  by  the  learned  Judicial 
Magistrate 
learned 
Additional  Sessions  Judge-II  /slamabad  
East  vide  their  respective  orders  dated 
24.06.2016 and  12.07.2016 for  forming  an 
opinion  that  the petitioner  falls  within  the 
ambit  of  the  expression  1desperate'  and 
1dangerous  criminal'  and,  therefore,  not 
entitled to be released on bail."

9. 

Not  one  iota  of  enmity  of  respondent 

No.2/complainant  with  present  petitioner/ 

accused has been alleged. No motive has been 

put  forward,  no  malice  has  been  pointed  out, 

then  why  complainant  would  falsely  implicate 

the  petitioner?  Even  no  such  allegation  had 

been  levelled  against  the  police.  Reliance  is 

placed  upon  Agee/ Ali  Mehmood  V.  The State 

andanother(2017  PCr.LJ Note 129). 

10. 

The  material  available  on  record  i.e. 

recovery  of  robbed  amount, involvement of  the 

petitioner  in  seven other  cases  of  like  nature, 

maximum punishment provided  for  the  offence 

is imprisonment up to ten years along with fine, 

the offence alleged is heinous and is considered 

Criminal  Misc.  No.917-B/  2020 

-5- 

as against the society,  therefore,  without  going 

into  deeper  appreciation  of 

the  material 

collected  by  the  prosecution,  on  the  basis  of 

tentative  assessment,  this  Court  has  come  to 

the  conclusion  that  petitioner  is  not  entitled  to 

the concession of bail at this stage. 

11. 

It  is  an  admitted  position  that  after 

submission of  challan, charge  has been framed 

on  03.02.2020  and  case  is  now  fixed  for 

prosecution evidence on 14.09.2020. In the light 

of  case  law  reported  as  Rehmatul/ah  V.  State 

(2011 SCMR 1332), the  courts  should not grant 

or  cancel  bail  when the trial  is  in progress  and 

proper  course for  the courts  in such a situation, 

would be to direct  the trial  court  to conclude the 

trial  of the case within a specific  period. 

12. 

The  case  laws  relied  upon  by  learned 

counsel for the petitioner  do not extend any help 

to the petitioner  due to having distinct  facts  and 

circumstances. 

13. 

In view of above, instant post arrest  bail 

petition  being  devoid  of  merits  is  dismissed. 

However, the  learned Trial  Court  is directed  to 

conclude  the  trial  within  a  period  of  three 

months after receipt of this order. 

14. 

Needless to  mention that  above is  only 

tentative  assessment for  the  purpose  of  instant 

bail  petition  only  and  shall  not  affect/influence 

trial  of the case in any manner.
