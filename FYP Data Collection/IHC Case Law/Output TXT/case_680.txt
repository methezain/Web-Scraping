01 

17 .02.2022  Mr.  Iftikhar  Ahmad  Bajwa,  Advocate. 

The  petitioner  assails  the  appellate  judgment  and 

decree  dated  11.01.2022  and  the  judgment  and  decree  in 

the  first  instance  dated  27 .10.2021  whereby  the  petitioner 

was  ordered  to  pay  maintenance  of Rs. I 0,000/-  per  month 

to  his  ex-wife  and  minor  daughter. 

2 

The  petitioner's 

right  to  defence  was  struck  off due 

to  non-payment  of  interim  maintenance, 

and  a  writ 

petition  against  the  said  order  was  also  dismissed  by  this 

Court  observing  that  the  learned  family  court  had  indulged 

the  petitioner  over  a  period  of almost  one  and  a  half year 

and  only  thereafter  struck  off  his  defence  under  section 

17-A of the  Family  Court  Act,  1964  (the relevant part of the 

High  Court's  order  is  reproduced  in  the  impugned  appellate 

judgment).  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that 

the  petitioner's  CNIC 

stands  blocked 

in  execution 

proceedings  and  seeks  interference  of  this  Court  which, 

however,  cannot  be  done  as  any  relief  in  relation  thereto 

has  to  be  applied  for  in  the  first 

instance  before 

the 

executing  Court  and  before  me  the  petitioner's  counsel 

hasn't  demonstrated  any  illegality 

in  the  order  of  the 

executing  Court. 

3 

The  petitioner's  counsel  says  that  the  petitioner  is an 

electrician  who  cannot  afford  the  maintenance  awarded. 

This  had  to  be  pleaded  and  proved  by  the  petitioner  during 

the  trial,  but  his  failure  to  pay  the  interim  maintenance  in 

2 

the  lower  sum  of Rs.4,500/-  per  month  for  a  prolonged 

period  seems  to  be  the  cause  of all  his  present  travails. 

Learned  counsel  has  not  pointed  out  any  illegality  or 

material  irregularity  in  the  impugned  judgments  calling 

for 

this  Court's 

interference 

in 

its  Constitutional 

jurisdiction. 

4 

This petition is therefore dismissed in limine.
