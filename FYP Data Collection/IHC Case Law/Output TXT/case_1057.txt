Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
04.11.2021  Syed  Shajjar  Abbas  Hamdani,  Advocate  for 

the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

assailed 

order 

dated 

13.10.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

Court,  East-Islamabad,  whereby  application 

for reduction of surety has been dismissed.  

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that it is evident from the 

record  that  the  petitioner  is  permanent 

resident  of  Sargodha  and  he  does  not  have 

any property in Islamabad, so he is unable to 

submit local surety in the Court, whereas the 

petitioner has categorically mentioned  in  the 

application that he  is ready to submit  surety 

according 

to  satisfaction  of 

the  Court 

pertaining  to  Sargodha  but  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad  has  refused 

the  same,  hence  the  impugned  order  is 

erroneous  and  the  same  is  liable  to  be  set-

aside.
