ORDER SHEET 
IN THE ISLAMABAD HIGH COURT, ISLAMABAD. 
JUDICIAL DEARTMENT. 

Writ Petition No.2792 of 2021 

Syeda Bint-e-Zehra. 
VS
Learned Judge Family Court-West, Islamabad and 02 others. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
06.08.2021  Syed Ishfaq Hussain Naqvi, Advocate for the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has 

impugned  order  dated 

29.07.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

Court-West,  Islamabad,  whereby  application 

for  interim  relief  filed  by  the  petitioner  was 

dismissed.  

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends 

that 

it 

is 

clearly 

mentioned  in  the  Nikahnama  that  plot  in 

Sector B-17 has been given to the petitioner 

as  a  gift  against  the  dower  by  respondent 

No.2  and Iqrarnama  in  this  regard  has  also 

been  executed,  respondent  No.2  has  not 

denied 

the 

contracting 

of  marriage, 

execution of the Nikahnama and execution of 

Iqrarnama.  Though 

the  execution  of 

Iqrarnama  has  been  challenged  but  no  final 

decision  has  been  given  in  this  regard.  It  is 

also  mentioned  in  the  impugned  order  that 

the  petitioner  has  a  prima  facie  case  but 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
injunctive  order  was  not  passed  and 

application  for  interim  relief  was  dismissed. 

Learned counsel further contends that during 

pendency  of  the  suit,  if  the  property  is 

transferred  or  alienated  to  anyone  else,  the 

petitioner  will  suffer  irreparable  loss  and  at 

the  end  if  decree  is  passed,  the  instant 

exercise  is  futile,  hence  the  impugned  order 

is liable to be set-aside. 

 3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice to the respondents. 

 4. 

Re-list on 25.08.2021. 

 C.M. No.01 of 2021. 

Notice.  Meanwhile, 

respondent 

No.2  is  restrained  from  alienating  the  suit 

property  to  anyone  else.  Restraining  order 

shall cease to exist and expire automatically, 

if  not  extended  specifically  on  the  next  date 

of hearing. 

 C.M. No.02 of 2021. 

Exemption  sought  for  is  allowed 

subject to all just and legal exceptions.
