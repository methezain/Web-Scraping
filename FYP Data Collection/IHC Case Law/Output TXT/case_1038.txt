Bilal Aslam. 

VS

Faiza Mahmood and another. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
09.11.2021  Mr.  Saad  Ahmad  Rajpoot,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

 Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

assailed 

order 

dated 

05.10.2021,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II, 

(Guardian), 

East-Islamabad, 

whereby interim maintenance of respondents 

No.1  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  per  month 

has been fixed. 

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that respondent No.1 has 

left  the  house  with  her  free  will  and  accord, 

petitioner is ready to provide accommodation 

and  all  basic  necessities  of 

life  but 

deliberately  and  willfully  respondent  No.1 

has left the house of petitioner, hence she is 

not  entitled  for  interim  maintenance.  Even 

the petitioner has made prayer for restitution 

of  conjugal  rights  in  his  written  statement 

but  instead  of  living  with  the  petitioner  and 

performing matrimonial obligations according 

to  injunctions  of  Islam,  respondent  No.1  is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
deliberately  and willfully avoiding  to perform 

her  matrimonial  obligations,  hence 

the 

impugned order is liable to be set-aside.   

 3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice  to  the  respondents.  Petitioner  is  also 

directed  to  place  all  the  relevant  documents 

on record through separate C.M.
