3. 

Briefly  stated  facts  of  the  prosecution  case  are  that  on 

24.01.2011,  one  Abdul  Hameed  Sheikh  lodged  F.l.R  No.34/2011 

with  Police Station  Shahzad Town,  Islamabad, with  the  averments 

that he is  a  resident of District Dadu, Sindh Province. He has taken 

a  house  on  rent  at  Chatha  Bakhtawar,  Islamabad,  and  for  past 

three  years,  he  is  residing  there.  It  has  been  alleged  that  on 

17.01.2011,  at  about  08:30am,  he  left  the  house  for  office  and 

when returned at about 07:00p.m, he saw that the locks of the main 

gate  have  been  broken and found  the following  household articles 

missing:- 

"4 precious  gents wrist watch, 4 ladies wrist watch, 3 movdo

Rs. 8, 0001-,  4 Boksi stitched clothes, one unstitched suit, one 

electric heater valued Rs.4, 0001-. 

It  has  been  further  alleged  that  some  unknown  accused  persons 

after  breaking  the  door  have  stolen  the  above-mentioned  articles. 

On 17 .11.2011, he came to know through his own sources that one 

of  his  friend  namely  Muhammad  Masood  along  with  four  others 

have  committed  theft  in  the .alleged house  and  thereafter,  he  has 

nominated  further  four  accused  persons  including  the  petitioner. 

After  registration  of the  F.l.R,  investigation was  carried  out  by the 

police;  on  13.02.2011,  petitioner  was  arrested  and  during 

investigation, DVD Player was allegedly recovered at the pointation 

of  petitioner.  After  usual  investigation  challan  of  the  case  was 

3 

Crl. ReyNo.108  ol8019 

submitted  before the  learned Court of Judicial  Magistrate, Section- 

30 (East), Islamabad. 

4. 

The  learned trial  Court after fulfilling  the  codal formalities  on 

08.06.2013,  framed  the  charge  against  the  petitioner  to  which  he 

pleaded  not  guilty  and  claimed  trial. 

In  order  to  prove  the 

accusation, the prosecution examined the following witnesses:- 

t. 

ii. 

iii. 

PW-  1,  Momin  Khan,  Head  constable,  (Recovery 
witness), 
PW-  2,  Muhammad Hanif,  Sub-Inspector,  (chalked 
out the F.l.R) 
PW- 3,  Muhammad Arshad,  constable, (Witness of 
recovery memo, Ex.P/2) 

5. 

During  trial,  on  16.09.2019, the  petitioner,  pleaded  guilty  to 

the  charge. The  learned trial Court served him with  a  Show Cause 

Notice  on  the  same  day  and  passed  conviction  order  dated 

16.09.2019  and  sentenced  him  as  mentioned  above  in  para  01. 

The  petitioner  being  aggrieved  from  the  order  dated  16.09.2019, 

filed  an  appeal  before  the  learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge-Ill, 

(East) 

Islamabad,  which  was  dismissed  vide  order  dated 

05.11.2019  on  the  ground that  the  petitioner  has pleaded guilty to 

the  charge and the appeal filed  by the  petitioner was  barred under 

Section 412 Cr.P.C hence, this revision petition. 

6. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that  the 

petitioner pleaded guilty and kept himself at the mercy of the Court; 

further  submitted  that  the  petitioner  is  only  earning  member of  his 

family  and  lastly  prayed for reduction  in  the  sentence  awarded  to 

the petitioner by the learned trial Court. 

7. 

Conversely,  the  learned State counsel  strongly  opposed the 

contention  of the  learned counsel for  petitioner contending that the 

petitioner  himself  has  pleaded  guilty  to  the  charge,  therefore,  the 

instant petition is  not competent hence, may be  dismissed. 

8. 

Heard the  learned counsel for the  petitioner and the  learned 

counsel for the state, peruse the record with their able assistance. 

4 

Crl. ReyNo.108 olZ019 

9. 

Perusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  F.l.R  No.34  dated 

24.01.2011  has  been  registered  with  the  Police  Station  Shahzad 

Town,  Islamabad. The  learned trial  Court has recorded statements 

of  three  prosecution  witnesses.  In  the  meanwhile,  on  16.09.2019, 

the  petitioner  made confessional statement  before the  learned trial 

Court,  however,  the  learned  trial  Court  keeping  in  view  the 

consequences  have  asked  again  some  questions  that  "do  you 

know  that  you  are  not  bound  to  make  this  statement"  and  some 

other  relevant questions  have been  put to the  petitioner even then 

the  petitioner  has  replied  that  "I  confess  my  guilt  voluntarily". The 

learned  trial  Court  has  also  served  him  a  show  cause  notice  and 

then passed the impugned judgment. 

10.  Keeping  in  view  the  confessional  statements  and  evidence 

recorded  by the  learned trial  Court,  it  reveals that  the  prosecution 

through  PW-3  has  proved  recovery  of  alleged  stolen  DVD  at  the 

pointation of petitioner from  his house which  has stood  proved that 

he has committed the alleged offence. 

11. 

The conviction to the petitioner under Section 411  P.P.C was 

bad in  the eyes of law as there is  even no allegation of the offence 

against the petitioner for such offence. The learned trial Court while 

passing  the  conviction  to  the  petitioner,  has  not  kept  in  mind that 

the  petitioner  was  sentenced  for  the  commission  of  theft  of  the 

same  articles  and  again  convicted  and  sentenced  him  under 

Section 411  P.P.C for  retaining the  same stolen item. That Article- 

13  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  of  Public  of  Pakistan.  1973, 

provides that:- 

"No person- 

a)  Shall  be  prosecuted  or punished  for  the  same  offence 

more than once," 

Therefore,  the  conviction  and  sentence  awarded  to  the  petitioner 

under  Section  411  P.P.C  was  bad  under  the  law.  On  the  other 

hand,  the  petitioner  pleading  guilty  to  the  charge,  made  a 

statement before the Court that he is a  poor man and sole earner of 

5 

Crl.  ReyNo.108  olZ019 

his family,  in  reply  to  the  show  cause  has  stated  that  he  pleaded 

guilty and left himself at the mercy of the Court. 

12.  Admittedly, the  petitioner has made clear confession thereby 

admitting  the  commission  of  alleged  offence.  It 

is  a  common 

practice  that  once  a  person  involved  in  a  criminal  case  wants  to 

plead guilty to the charge leveled against him and placed himself at 

the mercy of Court and in  that eventuality he becomes the friend of 

the  Court and the  court always takes  lenient view  in  respect of  his 

sentence .  Since the petitioner in  the instant case has straight away 

placed  himself  at  the  mercy  of  learned  trial  Court  and  pleaded 

guilty, therefore,  the  learned trial  Court has taken  a  lenient view  in 

respect  of  his  sentence which  is  neither  illegal  nor contrary  to  the 

punishment  provided  for  the  said  offence.  In  a  similar  case, 

reported as "Muhammad  Saeed v.  The State" (1985 SCMR  1405), 

the Hon'ble Supreme Court of Pakistan has held as under:- 

"Not  only  the  petitioner  pleaded  guilty,  he  also  admitted  that 
the drug recovered from him was substandard and declined to 
produce  any  evidence.  There  is  no  reason  why  after  the 
complaint  and  his  appearance  in  the  Drug  Court  he  should 
remain  unaware  that  he  was  making  a  statement  in  Court  in 
proceedings  which may result  in  his  conviction  and sentence. 
This being a case of conviction and sentence on his own plea 
of  guilty,  no  interference  is  called  for  and  hence  leave  to 
appeal is refused." 

13. 

In  view  of  the  above  facts  and  circumstances,  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  or 

irregularity  in  the  impugned  order  passed  by  learned  Judicial 

Magistrate,  Section-30,  East,  Islamabad  and  Judgment  dated 

05.11.2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge-Ill, 

East, 

Islamabad,  therefore,  this  petition  having  no  force 

is 

dismissed. 

Announced in open court, on  I 0  day of March, 2020.
