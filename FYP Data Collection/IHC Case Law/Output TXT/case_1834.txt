Murder Reference No.06/2016 

Islamabad  (PW-2)  and  Dr.  Muhammad  Naeem  Jan  (PW-10),  concluded  the  evidence 

whereafter  the  statements  of  appellants  were  recorded  U/S  342  Cr.P.C.  and  both  the 

appellants  have  been  convicted  and  sentenced  with  abovementioned  punishments  vide 

impugned judgment dated 31.05.2016, hence, instant appeals/ Murder Reference.  

4. 

Learned counsel for appellants contended that conviction passed by learned trial 

Court  U/S  302  (b)/  419/  420/  201/  34 PPC  is  against  law  and  facts  of  the  case  and  the 

entire  case  is  based  upon  circumstantial  evidence  in  which  the  chain  of  evidence  is 

missing whereas the learned trial Court has ignored the standard of proof and convicted 

the  appellants  without  any  basis;  that  the  instant  case  has  not  been  proved  beyond  any 

shadow of doubt and the recoveries have been planted in order to frame the appellants in 

this  case;  that  dead-body  was  not  recovered  on  the  pointation  of  appellants  and  it  has 

been brought  in  evidence  through PW-6 who  had  already  reached  at  the place of dead-

body, whereafter, the appellants were taken to the said place as PW-6 was watching and 

performing his duties as Guard before arrival of police party; that the complainant in this 

case has changed her stance on different occasions and the evidence of  CCTV video in 

USB/ Ex.P-90 from Margalla Hotel has not been proved in accordance with law and there 

are  glaring  contradictions  and  dishonest  improvements  made  by  the  prosecution  in  this 

case; that there is no direct evidence of last seen available against the appellants even the 

motive  has  not  been  proved  independently;  that  the  recovery  of  huge  amount  from 

appellant  Moaz  Waqar,  was  brought  by  the  father  of  appellant  which  has  been  planted 

upon  the  appellants  in  the  police  station  through  different  recovery  memos  in  order  to 

frame the appellants in this case; that USB/Ex.P-90 has not been proved in terms of the 

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,1984 being an electronic document.  

5. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  complainant  as  well  as  learned  State  Counsel 

contended  that  the  prosecution  has  successfully  brought  every  incriminating  piece  of 

evidence against the appellants whereby the appellant Moaz Waqar has been identified by 

PW-09/ Manager Margalla Hotel, Islamabad when he paid the bill of deceased Fahmina; 

that  Ex.P-17  is  invoice  bill  of  Margalla  Hotel  which  was  signed  by  appellant  Moaz 

Waqar and the defence side has not cross examined the star witness, hence, the statement 

to  that  extent  has  to  be  considered  as  admitted  against  the  appellant;  that  car  bearing

registration  No.IDD-8365,  Honda  City  used  in  said  crime  for  removal  of  evidence  was 

recovered from appellant Moaz Waqar and the same has been proved through Ex.P-1 rent 

agreement signed by the appellant Moaz Waqar; that vehicle used in crime has also been 

proved through the evidence of owner of rent-a-car business; that prosecution has proved 

the injuries of the deceased Fehmina through independent evidence of Dr. Tanvir Afsar 

Malik, Medico-Legal Officer, Federal Government Services Hospital, Islamabad (PW-1), 

Dr. Sabeen Aslam, Registrar Gynae Department, Federal Government Services Hospital, 

Islamabad (PW-2) and Dr. Muhammad Naeem Jan (PW-10).

10. 

Besides  the  above  referred  investigation  conducted  by  two  inspectors  the 

prosecution brought on record the statement of complainant Nosheba Taskeen as PW-11, 

Jahangir Hussain,  Manager Margalla Hotel,  as PW-9, Nazakat  Hussain,  ower of rent-a-

car as PW-4, Sikandar Ali, Constable as PW-6, Malik Amir Shahzad, draftsman as PW-7, 

Iftikhar Ahmed, Head Constable as PW-8, Muhammad Irshad, Head Constable, as PW-5, 

Muhammad  Rasheed,    ASI  as  PW-3,  and  three  doctors  i.e.  Dr.  Tanveer  Afsar  Malik, 

MLO  as  PW-1,  Dr.  Sabeen  Aslam  as  PW-2  and  Dr.  Muhammad  Naeem Jan  as  PW-10

Dr.  Tanvir  Afsar  Malik,  Medico-Legal-Officer,  Federal  Government  Services

On external examination following injuries were observed:- 
Injury No.1: There was a ligature mark on the middle of the neck

horizontal  aspect  of  the  neck  which  was  about  20  inches  in  all 
circumference.  

2. 
Injury  No.2:  There  was  a  contusion  mark  on  the  medi  aspect  of

meter which was only skin deep. 

Injury No.3: Punctured wound over the left side of  the scalp with 

3. 
surrounding redness, which was deeply seated.  

On dissection of the skull, dural membrances of the left side of the

heamorrhage.  

On dissection of neck, there was deep contusion mark all over the 
transfers  aspect  of  the  sub-cutanaous  tissues  and  muscles  of  neck, 
Tracheal rings were intact Ilyoid bone not fractured, clinical. On opening 
of the tracheal cavity slightly blood stained fluid was present. 

Skull  and  vertebrae  healthy,  membrances  spinal  cord,  dural 
membrances of the left side of the skull were ruptured, otherwise healthy.  

ABDOMEN.

present. Large intestine and contents were healthy with miled fecal matter.  

EXTERNAL & INTERNAL ORGANS OF GENERATION.

OPINION 

In my opinion, deceased sustained ligation over the middle of the 
neck  which  was  homicidal  in  nature,  causing  the  obstruction  of  upper 
respiratory tract organs causing the hypoxia and later-on anoxia causing 
the  death  of  the  deceased.  All  these  injuries  were  antemortem  in  nature 
and were sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of life. 

Probable time between injury and death five to seven minutes and 

probable time between death and postmortem approximately four day.” 

12. 

The  prosecution  produced  Dr.  Sabeen  Aslam,  Registrar  Gynie  Department, 

Federal government Services Hospital, Islamabad as PW-2 who has also given the details 

referred above by PW-1. The post-mortem report has been brought on record as Ex.PA.

13. 

Dr.  Muhammad  Naeem  Jan  appeared  as  PW-10  who  issued  death  certificate 

Ex.POO of deceased Fahmina. 

14. 

The  above  referred  case  prepared  by  the  prosecution  is  based  upon  evidence  of 

last seen, recovery of dead body, recovery of articles of deceased, recovery of SIM used 

for the purpose of ransom, recovery of crime weapon i.e. Cord Ex.P48, therefore, in order 

to  verify  all  these  factors  we  have  appraised  the  entire  evidence  submitted  by  the 

prosecution, however, all these portions of chain have to been seen separately in order to 

justify the conviction. 

LAST SEEN. 

15. 

The  prosecution  has  produced  Jahangir  Hussain,  Manager  of  Maralla  Hotel, 

Islamabad as PW-9 who got recorded his statement before the Court that on 09.10.2013 

one lady namely Fahmina Umair Suleman came to hotel and she checked in the hotel by 

the  hotel  staff.  She  provided  copy  of  her  passport.  She  was  given  room  No.134  of  the 

hotel. She said that her husband will come and he should be allowed to come inside the 

room.  On  10.10.2013  one  man  whose  name  was  later  on  revealed  Moaz  Waqar 

(appellant) came and paid the total charges of the room and went away and at about 12 

noon same day he again came on silver colour Honda Civic car and placed the luggage of 

deceased  Fahmina  in  his  vehicle  and  went  away  with  the  deceased  Fahmina.  On 

12.10.2013 the footage of CCTV camera was taken in USB Ex-P90 regarding the arrival 

and departure of the deceased and  accused, was handed over to the I.O alongwith entry 

card  Ex.P91  (Learned  defence  counsel  objected  on  the  exhibition  of  USB  in  terms  of 

articles 164, 73 and 78-A of Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984). During the course of cross 

examination following factors have been observed:- 

(i) 

The  Chief  Security  Officer  of  the  hotel  is  the  concerned  person  who  looks 

after the camera and security system. 

(ii) 

The Chief Security Officer is also not an I.T man. 

(iii) 

There is no person specifically appointed for monitoring the CCTV footage. 

(iv) 

USB  was  not  prepared  by  PW-9  it  was  prepared  by  the  I.T  person,  who 

prepared the USB under his permission. PW-9 doesn’t remember the name of 

person who prepared the USB.

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

(v) 

PW-9  is  not  aware  that  who  was  on  duty  when  the  CCTV  footage  was 

prepared and was handed over to the police on 12.10.2013. 

(vi) 

The  I.O.  also  did  not  record  the  statement  of  the  person  who  prepared  the 

USB and brought it to me to produce to the I.O. 

(vii) 

PW-9  does  not  know  the  contents  of  the  footage  because  he  neither  saw  it 

before nor after it was prepared. 

(viii)  Police  did  not  interrogate  any  bell  man  or  porter  who  took the  baggage  of 

the deceased to or from her room. 

(ix) 

Police did not record any evidence or interrogate any person having seeing 

the deceased lady boarding the car or any person taking her luggage. 

(x) 

At  the  time  when  the  deceased  was  checked  out  from  the  hotel  the  bill  was 

prepared by Mr. Sami-ur-Rehman he has now left the job about year ago. 

(xi) 

The only other thing which can show the check in or check out of guest is the 

computer generated bill.  

16. 

The above referred evidence is on two particular points i.e. last seen by Jahangir 

Hussain  PW-9  and  CCTV  footage  of  deceased  Fahmina  with  appellant  Moaz  Waqar, 

when the above referred two different set of evidence thrashed out, this Court has come 

to  the  conclusion  that  PW-9  in  his  statement  has  never  pointed  out  towards  appellant 

Moaz  Waqar  in  the  trial  Court  nor  even  identified  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  in  the  Court 

that he is the same man who was in company of deceased Fahmina when she left hotel on 

10.10.2013. Whereas the requirements of last seen evidence under the law is to prove that 

witness  has  seen  the  deceased  in  company  of  accused  and  he  identified  the  accused  in 

Court or in identification parade or he knew the accused otherwise from his credentials 

on his personal information but no such evidence was brought through PW-9 who is the 

material witness of last seen.  

17. 

The  second  important  piece  of  evidence  which  was  brought  on  record  in  the 

statement  of  PW-9  is  USB  Ex.P90  regarding  CCTV  footage  on  12.10.2013  in  which 

arrival and departure of deceased has been shown alongwith entry card Ex.P91. 

18. 

The above  referred evidence in  cross examination clearly reveals  that PW-9 has 

never  seen  the  said  CCTV  footage  neither  it  was  prepared  by  him  nor  the  same  was 

 
12 

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

shown to him in the learned trial Court. It has further been observed from the evidence 

that it is not his job to prepare such kind of footage but it was prepared by some analyst 

who was not called as witness in the Court, although, I.O has taken into possession the 

said USB but the learned trial Court has not seen the same even the same could not be 

considered by learned trial  Court while passing the sentence, therefore, it can safely be 

concluded  that  learned  trial  Court  has  not  justified  the  conviction  on  the  strength  of 

Ex.P90. Although this Court during the course of hearing called the investigation officer 

as well as Prosecutor on 10.07.2017 to display the material contained in USB Ex.P90 as 

the prosecution has never relied upon the said piece of evidence nor it was displayed in 

the learned trial Court, therefore, this Court issued direction to learned Advocate General, 

ICT to ensure the production of Ex.P90 alongwith instrument on which the same shall be 

displayed.  The  video  was  displayed  by  the  I.T.  Department  of  this  Court  on  Laptop  on 

13.12.2017 whereby this Court has observed  that first portion of CCTV footage reveals 

that  a  lady  on  10.10.2013  at  about  03:34  p.m.  in  Margalla  Hotel  at  counter/  reception 

desk is filling the documents, the second portion reveals that on the said date about 12:30 

on hotel counter, a man is filling the forms, third portion reveals that on the said date a 

person wearing blue shirt with French cut beard coming from lift entered into a room of 

the hotel, fourth clip is dated 10.10.2013 at about 11:15:39 a man entered into a room and 

at about 01:11 p.m. said lady left the room and at about 12:28 male person left the room 

of the hotel.  

19. 

The  above  referred  video  contents  do  not  reveal  that  a  male  and  female  were 

coming  together  or  leaving  together  from  the  hotel  in  any  manner  even  they  have  not 

been seen in conversation with each other in any of the video content nor prosecution put 

any  effort  to  get  verified  all  video  contents  from  complainant/  mother  of  deceased 

(Nosheba Taskeen)/PW-11 neither the same was explained by the Investigation Officer in 

his testimony.  

20. 

In view of above background we are of the view that objection raised in terms of 

articles  164,  73  and  78-A  of  Qanun-e-Shahdat  Order,  1984  has  to  be  seen  in  terms  of 

judgment  reported  as  2016  SCMR  2084  “Asfandyar  and  another  VS Kamran  and 

another” wherein it has been held that:-

Art. 164---Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage---Evidentiary value--
-Mere producing of CCTV footage as a piece of evidence in court was not 
sufficient  to  rely  upon  the  same  unless  and  until  it  was  proved  to  be 
genuine---In  order  to  prove  the  genuineness  of  such  footage  it  was 
incumbent  upon  the  defence  or  prosecution  to  examine  the  person  who 
prepared such footage from the CCTV system. 

Under Article 164, Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 trial court may 
allow production of Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage but it was 
incumbent  upon  the  defence  to  prove  the  same  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions  of  the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984.  Defence  had  to 
produce,  the  concerned  person  who  had  prepared  the  footage  from  the 
C.C.T.V. system in order to prove the same. Adverse party was to be given 
an  opportunity 
the 
genuineness or otherwise of the said footage.  

the  said  witness  regarding 

to  cross-examine 

Mere producing  of  CCTV footage as a piece of  evidence in  court 
was not sufficient to rely upon the same unless and until it was proved to 
be  genuine.  In  order  to  prove  the  genuineness  of  such  footage  it  was 
incumbent  upon  the  defence  or  prosecution  to  examine  the  person  who 
prepared such footage from the CCTV system. 

21. 

In  view  of  above  authoritative  judgment  of  apex  Court  we  are  of  the  confirmed 

view that the prosecution has not produced the author of said Ex.P90 before the Court nor 

the Investigation Officer recorded statement of any person who recorded the said video or 

prepared Ex.P90 which is necessary evidence to be corroborated, therefore, Ex.P90/USB 

has no evidentiary value for the purpose of capital punishment nor the same evidence can 

be used as incriminating material against the  appellant Moaz Waqar, similarly evidence 

of  Hotel  Manager  Jahangir  Hussain/  PW-9  is  also  not  in  accordance  with  law  to  be 

considered as valid piece of evidence to be relied upon. 

RECOVERY OF DEAD-BODY 

22. 

The  second  important  aspect  in  this  case  is  the  recovery  of  deady  body  of 

Fahmina  Chaudhry  which  was  recovered  through  recovery  memo  Ex.PN  dated 

14.10.2013 in presence of Sarwar Naeemi, ASI and Sikandar Ali, Head Constable-2928, 

P.S.  Aabpara  as  well  as  Inspector  Munawar  Ahmed/  Investigation  Officer  whereby  the 

appellant Moaz Waqar after disclosure of place of dead-body led the police party to the 

place of recovery on 14.10.2013 and got recovered the dead-body of deceased Fahmina 

from Shahpur Khajorian  under a pulley which was wrapped in colorful quilt/ Razai. In 

order to verify the recovery memo Ex.PN, Sikandar Ali/2928 has been produced as PW-6 

who stated before the Court that on 14.10.2013 appellant Moaz Waqar was arrested and 

vehicle  No.  IDD/8365  Honda  City  color  silver  was  recovered,  which  was  taken  into

possession vide recovery memo Ex.PH alongwith different articles including one mobile 

set  I-Phone  of  black  color  having  SIM  No.0332-1554670,  cheque  book,  one  iron  ring, 

one silver locket,  one Tawiz, two valets, two chargers of  cellular phone, one  receipt of 

Faisal Bank, One card of VIP jewelers, one empty SIM jacket, one battery card of vehicle 

comprising  of  Ex.P8  to  Ex.P45  which  were  taken  into  possession  vide  Ex.PJ.  PW-6 

further  stated  that  on  the  same  date  i.e.  14.10.2013  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  made 

disclosure  that  dead  body  of  Fahmina  was  disposed  of  in  the  area  of  Shah  pur  road, 

Khajoorian. The I.O. prepared memo of pointation as Ex.PM and also prepared recovery 

memo of dead body of Mst. Fahmina which was signed by Sarwar Naeemi, ASI. During 

the course of cross examination PW-6 acknowledged that:- 

(i) 

It is correct that the recovery memo relating to recovery of dead body does 

not bear any time. 

(ii) 

The dead body was recovered at about 10:00 am. 

(iii) 

The vehicle in which the accused was seating were at number three. 

(iv) 

I  can’t  say  in  which  vehicle  I  was,  volunteer,  we  had  gone  earlier  then  the 

police party.  

(v) 

I don’t  remember how  I reached the place of  recovery of  dead body.  I  was 

there about 1-1/2 to 2 hours before the arrival of the police party. 

(vi) 

I  had  visited  the  place  of  recovery  of  dead  body  twice  between  14.10.2013 

and 24.10.2013. It is correct that I had prior knowledge of place of recovery 

of dead body before 14.10.2013. 

23. 

The  above  referred  statement  of  PW-6  who  is  star  witness  of  recovery  of  dead 

body,  has  demolished  the  entire  case  of  the  prosecution  by  taking  a  stance  that  he  had 

already reached at the place of dead body of deceased Fahmina Chaudhry prior to arrival 

of police party and vehicle in which appellant Moaz Waqar came to identify the place.  

24. 

The other witness of said Ex.PN (recovery of dead body of Fahmina) is Munawar 

Ahmed/PW-12 (I.O) who got recorded his statement before the learned trial Court that on 

14.10.2013  during  the  investigation  accused  Moaz  Waqar  made  a  disclosure  that  on 

10.10.2013 he alongwith co-accused Asif had abducted deceased Fahmina from Magralla 

Hotel  on  their  vehicle  No.IDD-8365  Honda  City  color  silver  and  after  committing  her 

 
15

Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

murder they have thrown her dead body at Shahpur Road Khajorian under the culvert in a 

nullah.  He  further  stated  that  on  disclosure  of  accused  Moaz  Waqar,  he  led  the  police 

party and had pointed to the place of recovery of dead body i.e. Shah Pur Road Khajorian 

and got recovered the dead-body. The memo of pointation of place of recovery of dead 

body was prepared as Ex.PM and the dead body was taken into possession vide memo of 

recovery Ex.PN. He further stated that  photographs of place of recovery were captured 

and the place of recovery of dead body was between a land and a house whereas land was 

owned by one M.A Khalid and the house was owned by Deputy Secretary Safeer Abbasi 

which was a nullah under the culvert at Shahpur  road Khajorian, Islamabad. During the 

course of cross examination PW-12 acknowledged that:- 

(i) 

On 14.10.2013 dead body was recovered. It was not within the area of police 

station  Aabpara,  Islamabad.  I  had  not  informed  in  writing  the  concerned 

police station from which area the dead body was recovered. 

(ii) 

No private witness of the that area is associated from where the recovered of 

dead body was effected. 

(iii) 

The accused Moaz Waqar was taken for recovery at about 11.30 am. 

(iv) 

We had a Hafiz Anwar lady constable No.365  with us for  recovery of  dead 

body. 

(v) 

It is correct that the said lady constable was not cited as witness.  

25. 

The above referred statement of PW-6 & PW-12 if placed in juxtaposition then it 

can safely be concluded that there is a serious discrepancy among the statements of two 

witnesses who claimed to be at the place of recovery of dead body on 14.10.2013 but the 

most important factor comes on record is the difference of time where PW-6 had already 

reached  at  the  place  of  recovery  of  dead  body  at  about  10  a.m.  whereas  Investigation 

Officer alongwith  other  officials and  accused Moaz Waqar reached  at  about  11.30 a.m. 

and  if  the  same  has  to  be  seen  in  the  light  of  earlier  admission  of  PW-6.  The  entire 

recovery of dead body seems  to  be non-believable, hence, the prosecution has  failed to 

discharge  the  onus  of  recovery  of  dead  body  of  deceased  Fahmina  by  appellant  Moaz 

Waqar  and  a  serious  doubt  emerges  on  record.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2017  P.Cr.L.J 

1435  [Lahore]  “Muhammad  Safeer  and  another  VS The  State  and  others”  and

RECOVERY OF JEWELRY OF DECEASED FROM APPELLANT MOAZ 

WAQAR. 

26. 

From the perusal of record it has been observed that jewelry of deceased Fahmina 

Chaudhry was recovered through Ex.PR dated 17.10.2013 which includes four gold rings 

(white  gold),  one  gold  chain  (white  gold),  two  gold  tops  (white  gold),    one  locket  (S) 

(white gold), one locket chain (white gold) alongwith small box, in presence of witnesses 

Sikandar  Ali  HC-2928  and  Khawar  Abbas  2268-C.  All  these  jewelry  items  were 

recovered as per the prosecution story of PW-12.  

27. 

In  order  to  verify  the  status  of  recovery  memo  it  is  necessary  to  go  through  the 

relevant  evidence  of  the  witnesses  concerning  the  said  recovery  items.  Sikandar  Ali, 

constable/PW-6  stated  before  the  Court  that  on  17.10.2013  he  joined  the  investigation 

with  the  I.O.  The  accused Moaz Waqar made disclosure that he  could  recover the  gold 

ornaments of the deceased, he led us to his house number 1615 Bani Galla near Korang 

Nalla  and  from  a  living  room  situated  towards  northern  side  he  recovered  from  the 

Almirah, gold ornaments consisting of 4 rings of white gold Ex.P52/1-4, three chains of 

white gold Ex.P53/1-3 and tops of ear Ex.54/1-2 which were taken into possession by the 

I.O.  vide  recovery  memo  which  bears  his  signatures  as  Ex.PR/1  and  Khawar  Abbas. 

During the course of cross examination he acknowledged that:- 

(i) 

The  house  from  which  the  recovery  of  ornaments  was  affected  through 

recovery memo of gold ornaments on 17.11.2013 was an inhabited house. 

(ii) 

It is  the house where the parents  and the family of  accused Moaz  Waqar are 

residing. 

(iii) 

I don’t remember whether any lady police constable accompanied us. 

(iv) 

I don’t know whether the door was opened or I.O had knocked the door. 

(v) 

I don’t know or recognized the person who opened the door. I.O. had entered 

in the house. I also entered the house. 

(vi)  The  rooms  from  where  the  gold  ornaments  were  recovered  were  on  the 

northern side.

(vii) 

I don’t know it was on the ground floor or first floor. I was with the I.O  and 

entered in the room. 

(viii)  The  Almeria  from  where  the  gold  ornaments  were  recovered  in  the  shape  of 

safe, however, I don’t remember the detail of Almeria.  

(ix)  The  accused  Moaz  Waqar  himself  was  taking  out  the  recovered  gold 

ornaments. 

(x) 

I don’t remember that any key was handed over for opening of Almeria by any 

one. 

28. 

The  prosecution  has  not  produced  the  second  witness  of  recovery  memo  Ex.PR 

i.e. Khawar Abbas, Constable, therefore, the only witness left for the said recovery memo 

is Munawar Ahmed Inspector PW-12 who while appearing before the Court got recorded 

his statement that on 17.10.2013 accused Moaz Waqar during physical custody had made 

a  disclosure  and  led  to  his  house  No.1615,  at  Bani  Gala,  from  his  living  room  at  the 

northern  side,  he  recovered  four  white  gold  rings  Ex.P52/1-4,  two  earrings  Ex.P54/1-2, 

three  chain  lockets  Ex.P53/1-3  which  were  taken  into  possession  vide  recovery  memo 

Ex.PR.  During  the  course  of  cross  examination  PW-13  Muhammad  Qasim  Khan, 

Inspector (2nd I.O.) acknowledged that:- 

(i) 

Accused  Moaz  further  disclosed  that  deceased  Fahmina  had  left  the  gold 

jewelry with him and returned back to Karachi.

consisting upon few set of gold rings and locket and were given to the Raheem 

jeweler and he obtained two solid gold bar weighing 20 tolas. 

(iii)  Thereafter, he had sold out the remaining jewelry which was consisting upon 

one large locket, one small locket, two rings and two earrings were sold to VIP 

jeweler against sale consideration of Rs.9 lacs and the two gold bars were sold 

against  sale  consideration  of  Rs.11  lac,  while  four  rings,  two  earrings,  and 

three chain lockets were remained with him which he had placed in his house. 

29. 

The  prosecution  produced  Nosheba  Tasleem  as  PW-11  (mother  of  deceased)  to 

prove  the  identification  of  jewelry  which  were  recovered  from  appellant  Moaz  Waqar. 

PW-11  stated  before  the  Court  that  on  27.11.2013  she  visited  police  station  Aabpara

alongwith  his  son  Umar Farooq  whereby SHO  Qasim and ASI Rasheed had shown the 

recovered articles consisting upon 36 items i.e. four rings of white gold and diamond of 

deceased  Fahmina  P-93/1-4,  one  pair  of  earrings  of  white  gold  and  diamond  P-94,  one 

plain bracelet of white gold P-95, two gold chains P-96/1-2, pendant S shape of gold P-97 

were recovered from accused Moaz Waqar however, she had not said that she identified 

the  jewelry  that  it  belonging  to  her  daughter,  however,  during  the  course  of  cross 

examination she acknowledged the following facts regarding jewelry:-  

(i) 

The jewelry mentioned by me including the jewelry given to  her by  me and 

my family and it also include the jewelry given to her In-laws.  

(ii) 

I  had  not  given  the  receipt  of  purchase  of  which  was  jewelry  given  to  the 

deceased to the police since, it was handed over to the deceased along with 

the jewelry.  

(iii) 

I  did  not  inform  the  police  about  the  shops  from  where  I  purchased  the 

jewelry because police had not asked me. 

(iv) 

Similarly,  no  receipts  were  produced  about  the  jewelry  provided  by  the 

family of Umair Suleman to the deceased because police had not asked for it. 

(v) 

There is no restriction under any law to travel by Air with such huge amount 

of jewelry.  

30. 

The  above  referred  evidence  brought  by  the  prosecution  regarding  recovery  and 

identification  of  jewelry  of  deceased  from  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  is  admitted  to  the 

extent  of  identification  of  jewelry  but  the  recovery  proceedings  which  have  been 

conducted by the police create suspicion especially when PW-6 is not aware of any of the 

steps of recovery proceedings as the house was inhabited, it was opened by whom? He is 

not aware whether the jewelry was recovered from room situated on ground floor or first 

floor and no one else was there in the said house, which shows that the entire proceedings 

seem  to  be  artificial  and  even  recovery  has  not  took  place  in  a  manner  in  which  it  has 

been  stated,  therefore,  entire  recovery  proceedings  of  Ex.PR  of  the  jewelry  of  the 

deceased are disbelieved, however, identification by mother is not in line with contention 

of other PWs.

31. 

As  per  story  of  prosecution  deceased  Fahmina  was  abducted  and  murdered  by 

Moaz Waqar/appellant and the said story was initially referred in complaint Ex.PQQ by 

complainant/ PW-11 (mother of deceased) whereas no details of any jewelry was given in 

the said complaint, however, her supplementary statement was recorded on 12.10.2013 in 

which  she  categorically  referred  the  gold  jewelry  valuing  Rs.50  lacs  and  she  also 

recorded  another  supplementary  statement  on  14.10.2013  in  which  she  referred  the 

motive  for  the  murder  of  deceased  i.e.  greed  for  money  by  Moaz  Waqar/appellant. 

Complainant/  PW-11 appeared in  police station  on 27.10.2013 alongwith his  son Umar 

Farooq whereby SHO Qasim and ASI Rasheed had shown recovered articles consisting 

of 36 items out of which P-93/1-4 four rings of white gold and diamond, P-94 one pair of 

earrings of white gold and diamond, P-95 one plain bracelet of white gold, P-96/1-2 two 

gold  chains,  P-97  pendant  S  shape  of  gold  which  were  allegedly  recovered  from  Moaz 

Waqar/ appellant although the said recoveries have already been disbelieved but in order 

to  verify  the  status  of  these  items  the  defence  has  cross  examined  the  complainant  and 

she admitted the following facts:- 

“On 17th August 2013, Fahmina came to Pakistan for the last time and she 
landed  directly  in  Islamabad.  It  is  correct  that  I  and  my  deceased 
daughter Fahmina spent out pleasure trip in Islamabad and from there we 
both went to Karachi and deceased did not return to Singapore, volunteers 
accused Moaz  Waqar was holding her passport and during my visit with 
my deceased daughter Fahmina, the deceased handed over her jewelry to 
accused Moaz Waqar.”  

Sher further acknowledged the following factors in her evidence:- 

“It  is  correct  that  I  made  three  statements  i.e.  application  Ex.PQQ, 
supplementary  statement  of  12.10.2013  and  supplementary  statement  of 
14.10.2013. It is correct that in Ex.PQQ I stated that the value of jewelry 
was  Rs.4,000,000/-.  It  is  incorrect  that  I  had  stated  the  weight  of  the 
jewelry as 50 Tolas gold and white gold, confronted with Ex.D5 portion A 
to A, volunteers that I had not stated the weight of jewelry but the police 
recorded  it  and  therefore,  I  had  made  correction  in  my  supplement 
statement dated 14.10.2013. It is correct that Ex.D5 does not mention the 
value  of  the  jewelry.  It  is  correct  that  I  recorded  my  supplementary 
statement  on  12.10.2013  in  order  to  correct  my  statement  Ex.PQQ.  I 
remembered the error in Ex.PQQ subsequently and made the correction in 
my supplementary statement in the evening time before 5:00 pm. My son 
in law corrected me and therefore, I made the supplementary statement. I 
read the FIR to my son in law and he then informed me about the error in 
the worth of the jewelry on telephone. About this fact there is no record of 
telephone and it is only my statement.”

Murder Reference No.06/2016 

Besides the above referred statement of PW-11 following facts were further admitted:- 

“The  jewelry  mentioned  by  me  including  the  jewelry  given  to  her  by  me 

and my family and it also include the jewelry given to her In-laws. I had 

not  given  the  receipt  of  purchase  of  which  was  jewelry  given  to  the 

deceased  to  the  police  since,  it  was  handed  over  to  the  deceased  along 

with the jewelry. I did not inform the police about the shops from where I 

purchased  the  jewelry  because  police  had  not  asked  me.  Similarly,  no 

receipts were produced about the jewelry provided by the family of Umair 

Suleman to the deceased because police had not asked for it.” 

The  above  referred  three  different  portions  of  cross  examination  clearly  reveal  that  the 

jewelry was already with appellant Moaz Waqar as claimed by complainant and it was in 

the  knowledge  of  complainant  as  she  stated  in  her  but  the  jewelry  allegedly  recovered 

from  appellant  Moaz  has  not  been  verified  from  any  independent  source  i.e.  receipt  of 

purchase of jewelry nor any jeweler was confronted in this regard even the complainant is 

not able to disclose the jewelry shop from where she purchased the said jewelry. These 

facts  clearly  demonstrate  that  the  statement  in  which  she  recorded  her  stance  regarding 

jewelry  is  not  believable  even  she  has  changed  the  value  of  jewelry  through 

supplementary statement but the fact remains the same that the detail of jewelry is most 

important factor which had to be disclosed to the police authorities but such details have 

not  been  given  by  the  PW-11and  particularly  with  reference  to  these  items  which  were 

allegedly  recovered  from  appellant  Moaz  Waqar.  Even  otherwise,  the  Investigation 

Officer/  PW-13  stated  before  the  Court  that  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  had  given  gold 

jewelry of the deceased  to  Raheem  jeweler and  obtained to  solid  gold  bar weighing 20 

tols  and  the  remaining  jewelry  consisting  upon  one  large  locket,  one  small  locket,  two 

rings and two earrings were sold to VIP jeweler against sale consideration of Rs.11 lacs 

but  both  these  jewelers  have  not  been  associated  as  witness  nor  their  statements  have 

been recorded even they have not been produced before the Court. 

32. 

In  view  of  above  background  recovered  jewelry  as  referred  in  recovery  memo 

Ex.PR dated 17.10.2013 is also disbelieved.  

STATUS OF CAR BEARING REGISTRATION NO.IDD-8365, HONDA CITY

memo Ex.PH and the Investigation Officer took into possession rent a car agreement by 

appellant  Moaz Waqar  Ex.1 which was executed on  09.10.2013 with  Ahsan Associates 

Car Rentals, Copy of CNIC of appellant Moaz Waqar was also taken into possession as 

Ex.P2  alongwith  copy  of  I.D.  Card  of  Ahsan  Group  of  Business.  The  Investigation 

Officer has also taken into possession Authority Letter as Ex.P3 and sales invoice of said 

vehicle as Ex.P4, Sale Certificate as Ex.P5 whereas, no registration book was recovered 

in  this  case  nor  the  same  was  verified  in  any  manner  by  the  Investigation  Officer, 

however, during the search of said vehicle no incriminating article was recovered which 

belong  to  deceased  Fahmina  through  which  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  alleged  car  was 

used in commission of murder of deceased Fahmina.  

RECOVERY OF I-PHONE 4 ALONGWITH SIM NO.0334-9554181 USED FOR 
RANSOM. 

34. 

The  Investigation  Officer  PW-12  stated  before  the  Court  that  on  18.10.2013 

accused Moaz Waqar during interrogation disclosed that on 11.10.2013 and 13.10.2013, 

he  had  contacted  the  complainant  (mother  of  the  deceased)  on  her  phone  No.0321-

2011925 twice and he twice sent her SMS from the SIM No.0334-9554181 of his cousin 

Abdullah and demanded Rs.2 Crore as ransom money from the complainant. The phone 

set  I-4 of black color is present in his house which he can get recovered  and thereafter, 

accused led the police to his house at Bani Gala and under the mattress of his room he got 

recovered  the  mobile  phone  (Ex.P55)  which  was  taken  into  possession  vide  recovery 

memo Ex.PS. The witnesses signed it and their statement was recorded U/S 161 Cr.P.C. 

The phone set  was having  IMEI  No.012645007534579, the recovery memo  was signed 

by  Sikandar  Ali  2928/HC  and  Khawar  Abbas  2268/C  whereas,  Khawar  Abbas  2268/C 

has  not  been  produced.  The  other  witness  of  recovery  is  Sikandar  Ali  PW-6  who 

reiterated the same story of the investigation officer/PW-12 and confirmed his signatures 

on the recovery memo Ex.PS/1, however, during the course of cross examination PW-6 

admitted that:- 

(a) 

The house from which the recovery of gold ornaments was affected 

through  recovery  memo  of  gold  ornaments  on  17.11.2013  was  an 

inhabited house.

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

(b) 

It is the house where the parents and the family of accused Moaz 

Waqar are residing.  

(c) 

I don’t know whether the door was opened or I.O had knocked the 

door. 

35. 

The above stated stance also confirms that on 18.10.2013 place of recovery of I-

Phone alongwith SIM No. 0334-9554181 was already known to the Investigation Officer 

as  well  as  PW-6  the  witness  of  recovery.  The  place  of  alleged  recovery  is  a  inhabited 

house,  no  person  was  available  in  the  said  house  who  opened  the  door  nor  it  has  been 

brought by the prosecution that the premises were already sealed as a crime scene nor it is 

the  case  of  prosecution  that  articles  were  recovered  in  one  day,  police  officials  have 

earlier  visited  the  place,  therefore,  the  recovery  of  I-Phone  alongwith  SIM  have  no 

evidentiary value in this criminal case for the purpose of capital punishment.  

36. 

The  Investigation  Officer  was  also  cross  examined  who  was  also  aware  of  the 

place of recovery as he earlier visited the place as per his own stance, therefore, all the 

subsequent recoveries which were allegedly made from the same place have to be seen in 

the light of Articles 38, 39 & 40 of the Qanun-e-Shahdat Order, 1984 and objection was 

also  raised  by  the  appellants  side  during  the  trial  whereas  from  the  perusal  of  entire 

judgment this aspect has not been discussed by the learned trial Court, therefore, in order 

to  understand  the  concept  of  discovery  in  terms  of  relevant  provisions  of  the  Qanun-e-

Shahadat  Order,  1984  it  is  necessary  to  go  through  the  said  provisions,  whereby 

prosecution is under heavy burden to prove the fact of recovery of I-Phone or jewelry or 

any  other  item  allegedly  discovered  in  consequence  of  information  received  from  the 

accused of any offence in custody of police officer and such information relates to a fact 

of discovery which is in exclusive knowledge of that accused in terms of Article 40 of the 

Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 whereas, in our humble view the information of place of 

recovery  was  already  with  the  Investigation  Officer  prior  to  the  recovery  of  I-Phone  as 

the exercise of recovery had already been made for the purpose of jewelry on 17.10.2013, 

therefore,  this  recovery  has  no  evidentiary  value.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2003  SCMR 

1419  “Khalid  Javed  and  another  VS The  State”,  hence,  the  same  cannot  be  used 

against the appellant Moaz Waqar.

MOBILE PHONE CALL DATA RECORD (CDR). 

37. 

The  prosecution  has  linked  the  appellants  with  the  Call  Data  Record  (CDR)  for 

the purpose of SMSs and mobile calls which were used for the purpose of ransom and in 

this regard the prosecution has brought on record statement of Muhammad Qasim Khan, 

Inspector/ PW-13 who contended that on 27.10.2013 through post/Dak seven pages print 

out message regarding SIM No.0334-9554181 and 14 pages print out of phone No.0333-

5353232,  No.0332-1554670  belonging  to  accused  Moaz  Waqar,  (14  pages)  of  SIM 

No.03420508388  belonging  to  accused  Asif  Mehmood  and  other  miscellaneous 

documents  sent  by  Umair  Suleman  husband  of  deceased  Fahmina  were  taken  into 

possession vide separate recovery memo Ex.PV which was attested by the witnesses. He 

also got recorded the statement of Nosheba Takseen and Umar Farooq U/S 161 Cr.P.C. 

PW-13/  Inspector  also  stated  that  on  30.11.2013,  Umair  Suleman  husband  of  deceased 

Fahmina had sent E-mail to the police high ups which were received through official dak 

and the e-mail were consisting upon eight pages and the same were taken into possession 

vide  recovery  memo  Ex.PX  which  was  attested  by  the  witnesses.  During  the  course  of 

cross  examination  he  stated  that  there  is  a  dispatch  register  maintained  at  every  police 

station  through  which  mails  are  sent  and  the  person  who  received  the  dak  through  a 

dispatch  register  is  required  to  sign  the  relevant  column  of  dispatch  register.  PW-13 

further  stated that  he cannot  tell  the name or rank of the high ups police officials from 

whom he had received the dak Ex.PV and Ex.PX and even he has was not able to prove 

that who placed the said dak on his table.  

38. 

Beside the above referred answers to the particular questions this Court has taken 

notice of Ex.PV (

 زیوع تاذغاک و یزیزحت ىایت و

ضیا۔نیا۔ضیا

ڈراکیر و ىوف لئاتوه ڈراکیر

ىاویلط)  which was sent by Umair Suleman but he was neither produced as witness nor he 

joined the investigation as he never came to Pakistan. Similarly, record of mobile phone 

as  well  as  documents  of  Umair  Suleman  has  also  been  taken  into  possession  vide 

recovery memo Ex.PX on 30.11.2013 but when we compare both these recovery memos 

while placing them in juxtaposition, the signatures of witness Sikandar Khan-2928/HC on 

Ex.PX  do  not  match  with  any  of  his  previous  signatures  available  on  Ex.PV,  Ex.PN, 

Ex.PH,  Ex.PJ,  therefore,  in  our  humble  view  both  the  recovery  memo  lost  their 

 
 
 
 
24 

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016

evidentiary value, even the mobile data record which has been placed on record through 

Ex.PV  and  Ex.PX  has  not  been  confirmed  from  any  independent  source  i.e.  mobile 

company, therefore, same has lost its status to be used for the purpose of conviction  as 

per operative evidence in this case and the same is hereby discarded.  

RECOVERY OF CASH AMOUNT FROM APPELLANT MOAZ WAQAR 

39. 

The  prosecution  has  brought  on  record  the  recovery  memos  Ex.PEE,  Ex.PHH, 

Ex.PJJ, Ex.PKK, Ex.PLL, Ex.PMM which contain recovery of amounts of Rs.400,000/-, 

Rs.600,000/-,  Rs.500,000/-,  Rs.40,000/-,  Rs.80,000/-  and  Rs.160,000/-  from 

the 

appellants,  therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  discuss  the  status  of  said  recovery  as  it  is 

corroborative  piece  of  evidence  through  which  prosecution  put  its  effort  to  connect  the 

appellant  with  the  said  crime.  All  these  recovery  memos  have  been  prepared  on 

25.10.2013,  29.10.2013,  04.11.2013,  06.11.2013  &  11.11.2013  and  were  prepared  by 

Ghulam  Qasim  Khan  Niazi  SHO/  PW-13  and  the  witnesses  Iftikhar  Ahmed  5285-HC/ 

PW-8  and  Abid  Ali  3775-C  signed  the  same  as  second  witness  whereas  Abid  Ali 

constable has not been produced by the prosecution.  

40. 

As  per  the  stance  of  PW-13  who  recorded  his  statement  before  the  Court  and 

stated that appellant  Moaz Waqar  led to  the police party to his  resident  house No.1615 

and  he  led  us  inside  his  room  and  recovered  I-pad  box  which  contained  IMEI 

No.012667006448563  and  one  box  of  I-phone  IMEI  No.012645007534579,  mobile 

phone  X3S  box  IMEI  No.0121560018033051  and  one  SIM  No.0334-9554181  Ex.P62 

which  was  used  by  him  for  the  purpose  of  ransom  of  Rs.2  crore  and  appellant  Moaz 

Waqar also got recovered Rs.400,000/- from his home which was the sale consideration 

of jewelry articles of the deceased sold by the him.  However, he stated that on the said 

day  i.e.  25.10.2013,  accused  Moaz  Waqar  made  a  disclosure  that  he  had  concealed  the 

pistol  at  Kashmir  Highway  and  he  could  recover  the  same,  thereupon  appellant  Moaz 

Waqar led them to the place of recovery of pistol however, from there the Investigation 

Officer  alongwith  Javed  S.I,  Iftikhar  Ahmed  HC  Abid  Ali  alongwith  appellants  Moaz 

Waqar and Asif Mehmood proceeded to Bani Gala on official vehicle and got recovered 

the  above  referred  items.  Learned  counsel  for  appellants  had  raised  objection  before 

learned trial Court regarding the statement given by the Investigation Officer before the 

 
25 

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

Court, however, the said objection has not been decided in the judgment by the learned 

trial Court. The specific words used in the statement of PW-13 are as under:-  

“We alongwith accused Moaz Waqar and accused Asif went to Al-
Nasir street Bani Gala on the pointation of the accused Moaz Waqar. We 
de-boarded the vehicle and accused Moaz Waqar led us to his house and 
he opened the house with his  key which already  recovered from  accused 
Moaz  Waqar  and  on  his  disclosure  that  the  recovered  key  from  his 
possession was of that house and it has to be taken alongwith us in order 
to open the said house.” 

41. 

The  Investigation  Officer  further  stated  before  the  Court  that  on  29.10.2013  at 

about  5:00  p.m.  father of accused Moaz Waqar  came at  police station and handed over 

Rs.6 lacs to accused Moaz Waqar which he handed over it to him (I.O) and the same was 

taken into possession  vide recovery  memo Ex.PHH which  was signed by  Abid  Ali  and 

Iftikhar and same exercise was again done on 04.11.2013, father of accused Moaz Waqar 

came at Police Station and handed over to accused Moaz Rs.500,000/- who presented the 

same  to  Investigation  Officer  through  recovery  memo  Ex.PJJ  and  similar  exercise  was 

again done on 06.11.2013 when father of accused Moaz Waqar handed over Rs.140,000/- 

from  the sale proceed which was handedover to  the appellant and the same  were taken 

into  possession  vide  recovery  memo  Ex.PKK.  Similarly,  Rs.80,000/-  were  also  taken 

from  the  father  of  accused  Asif  Mehmood  through  Ex.PLL.  Similarly,  on  11.11.2013 

Rs.160,000/- were taken into possession from accused Moaz Waqar vide recovery memo 

Ex.PMM. 

42. 

The  above  referred  recovery  proceedings  of  three  empty  box  and  mobile  phone 

form  the  house  of  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  situated  in  Bani  Gala  is  admittedly  a  joint 

recovery as referred above by the Investigation Officer and it was a known place to the 

Investigation  Officer  in  terms  of  Article  40  of  the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984  and 

there is no new discovery of fact which led to recovery of three boxes as the said house 

was  earlier  visited  by  the  previous  Investigation  Officer  with  other  police  officials  on 

number of occasions even the said house was opened and inhabited in the previous round 

of  recoveries  as  stated  by  the  previous  Investigation  Officer/  PW-12  as  well  as  PW-6, 

therefore,  entire  recovery  proceedings  lost  their  legal  significance  and  admissibility  for 

the purpose of corroborative evidence against appellant Moaz Waqar.

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

43. 

Besides the above referred legal defect it is not a discovery in terms of Article 40 

of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 as the place was already known to the Investigation 

Officer  even  the  other  recoveries  of  amount  which  were  taken  into  possession  through 

different  recovery  memos  are  nothing  but  exercise  of  misuse  of  authority  by  the  police 

officials which is apparent from record as the father of the appellants paid huge amount 

to  the  Investigation Officer which  was taken into possession  through different  recovery 

memos on different dates by handing over the same to the appellants who were already in 

custody  and  on  physical  remand,  therefore,  such  kind  of  exercise  is  just  an  abuse  of 

authority  and  nothing  else,  hence,  the  entire  recoveries  made  by  Investigation  Officer/ 

PW-13 have no evidentiary value and cannot be used as incriminating evidence against 

the appellants for the purpose of conviction.  

RECOVERY OF ARTICLE FROM APPELLANT ASIF MEHMOOD. 

44. 

Investigation Muhammad Qasim Khan Inspector (PW-13) arrested appellant Asif 

Mehmood  on  22.10.2013  from  Bus  Stop  Aabpara  Chowk  of  route  No.127  on  spy 

information and on 23.10.2013 his eight days physical remand was obtained from Anti-

Terrorism Court and as per prosecution story Asif Mehmood had pointed out the place of 

recovery  of  dead  body  on  24.10.2013  which  was  already  identified  earlier  to  the  said 

date,  therefore,  the  place  of  pointation  in  case  of  appellant  Asif  Mehmood  has  no 

relevancy. The complainant nominated Asif Mehmood through supplementary statement 

dated 14.10.2013 whereas, the prosecution has alleged in the evidence that appellant Asif 

Mehmood got recovered all the personal belongings of deceased Fahmina on 25.10.2013 

in  presence  of  Qasim  Ali  Khan/  PW-13  and  Iftikhar  Ahmed/HC  (PW-8)  vide  recovery 

memo  Ex.PFF  from  Traith  which  includes  one  empty  suitcase  grey  color  Ex.P66,  one 

small  empty  suit  case  grey  color  Ex.P65,  one  golden  color  belt  Ex.P67,  one  colorful

45. 

However,  during  the  course  of  cross  examination  of  PW-13  Muhammad  Qasim 

Khan/ Inspector contended that he alongwith appellant Asif Mehmood proceeded towards 

village Satra Meel whereby appellant Asif Mehmood led the police party to his house and 

got recovered two suite cases belonging to deceased Fahmina one hand bag and different 

article  which  were  present  in  suite  cases  Ex.P65  to  Ex.P89/1-4  taken  into  possession 

through recovery memo Ex.PFF. Whereby the Investigation Officer conceded before the 

Court  that  recovery  was  made  from  village  Traith  which  might  be  in  territorial 

jurisdiction of Punjab province. He also  conceded that in  his  statement  he deposed that 

recovery was affected from village Satra Meel and he is unable to identify the territorial 

jurisdiction of police station in which the place of recovery is situated. He also conceded 

that Police Station Bani Gala is a separate police station and it is not part of P.S. Aabpara. 

P.S. Bhara Kahu is not adjacent to the boundary of P.S. Aabpara. There is no denial to the 

proposition that the place of  recovery in case of  appellant  Asif Mehmood is  not  within 

the territorial jurisdiction of Islamabad nor even the same was given protection under the 

law  and  the  time  of  departure  from  police  station  which  has  been  reflected  from 

Roznamcha  is  03  p.m.  on  25.10.2013.  He  also  conceded  that  some  of  the  entries  have 

been arrayed whereafter subsequent amendment was made with different ink. Similarly, 

complainant  Nosheba  Tasleem/  PW-11  while  appearing  before  learned  trial  Court 

contended  that  she  identified  the  items  which  were  recovered  from  appellant  Asif 

Mehmood referred as Ex.P98/1-2 to Ex.P116 including two empty suit cases of large size 

grey color Ex.P98/1-2, Samsung mobile I-phone-4 of white colour of deceased Fahmina 

Ex.P99, Driving licenses of the deceased P-100, one bracelet of bronze colour having a 

mark  of  Bulgrey  P-101,  one  chain  of  gold  and  having  heart  shape  diamond  pendent  P-

102, one gold ring with Zircon stone in rectangular shape P-103, one silver ring with pink 

stones,  P-104,  one  wallet  having  Mark  of  Parrada  on  it  in  which  she  used  to  keep  her 

driving license and cash P-105, two currency notes of Singapore dollars P-106/1-2, two 

coins each of 20 cent P-107/1-2, Avatar accessory of mobile phone, P-108, Camera Stand

P-109,  one  gold  bracelet  P-110,  two  bottles  of  perfume  P-111/1-2,  two  dress  belts  P-

112/1-2,, printed scarf P-113, one purple colour T-shirt P-114, one empty poach of VIP 

jeweler P-115, one empty make up kit P-116 and other miscellaneous articles.   

46. 

However, she failed to produce any receipt of purchase of any of the said items 

which  were  claimed  to  be  of  deceased  Fahmina  and  got  recovered  from  appellant  Asif 

Mehmood although the evidence submitted by the Investigation Officers (PW-12 & PW-

13) clearly prove that recovery was made from village Traith whereby the said recovery 

has not been proved independently. Even otherwise it is the mandatory concept of law to 

justify the recovery through legal manner, however, the Investigation Officer as well as 

other  witnesses  have  not  attended  to  the  requirements  of  section  161  Cr.P.C.  wherein 

place  of  recovery  is  in  different  jurisdiction  and  it  is  held  mandatory  that  Investigation 

Officer shall put his entry in Daily Diary of other police station before heading towards 

he place of recovery unless the delay occasioned might result into destruction of evidence 

whereas, in this case the Investigation Officer has not taken any precautionary measures 

nor even informed the local police station of village Traith which is within the territorial 

jurisdiction  of  Punjab  and  got  recovered  the  articles  which  is  not  considered  legal  in 

terms  of  judgment  passed  by  apex  Court  reported  as  2011  SCMR  323  “Amin  Ali  & 

another VSThe State” wherein it has been held that:- 

“Recovery  was  made  from  jurisdiction  of  another  police  station  but 
investigating officer did not go to that police station or make any entry so 
as to show his presence at relevant time within jurisdiction of that police 
station  or  took  some  help  from  that  police  station---Effect---Such  act  of 
investigating officer, created doubt about genuineness of recovery and no 
implicit reliance could be placed on such type of evidence.” 

47. 

In  view  of  above  background  the  recovery  of  jewelry  to  the  extent  of  appellant 

Asif Mehmood as well as his status in the entire case has not been justified or proved by 

the Investigation Officers even the prosecution has not brought any concrete evidence to 

implicate appellant Asif Mehmood in murder of Fahmina.  

CONCLUSION 

48. 

In  view  of  above  detailed  discussion  of  evidence  we  are  of  the  view  that 

prosecution  has  failed  to  prove  the  facts  narrated  in  the  complaint  alleged  by  the 

complainant. The factum of ransom, abduction, SMSs and calls have not been proved by 

the  complainant,  even  the  CDR  which  was  taken  into  possession  by  the  Investigation

Officer  was  brought  through  e-mail  from  husband  of  deceased  but  the  said  person  was 

not associated in the investigation nor his statement was recorded in terms of section 161 

Cr.P.C. The most crucial evidence in the entire case is recovery of deadbody which was 

already known to the police authorities as confirmed by the recovery witness PW-6, as he 

specifically stated that he has prior knowledge of place of recovery of dead body before 

14.10.2013,  therefore,  the  pointation  of  place  of  dead  body  of  deceased  has  not  been 

substantiated  by  the  prosecution  and  recovery  of  jewelry  of  deceased  has  not  been 

established independently through any jeweler or by any documentary evidence in shape 

of receipts. Even otherwise mother of deceased admitted the fact that jewelry was already 

with  appellant  Moaz  Waqar  although  it  was  the  case  of  prosecution  that  entire  jewelry 

was converted into  gold  bars  and sold  to  different  jewelers but  those jewelers have not 

been associated in the investigation nor even produced before the Court during trial.  

49. 

In last most important piece of evidence i.e. USB/ Ex.P90 evidence relating to last 

seen has not been brought on record by the prosecution during the course of trial nor even 

the  said  CCTV  footage  was  displayed  in  the  Court,  although  this  Court  displayed  the 

CCTV  footage  in  the  Court  but  the  entire  contents  of  CCTV  footage  could  not 

demonstrate that both the appellant  or deceased  were together in  any manner, the hotel 

manager is not the author of said CCTV footage/USB nor the said footage was taken into 

possession in accordance with the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984. 

50. 

The  entire  background  persuades  this  Court  that  when  place  of  recovery  had 

already  been  visited  by  the  Investigation  Officer  and  police  officials,  the  pointation  of 

recovery  has  no  significance.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2016  YLR  1291  [Peshawar] 

“Kabir  Shah  VS The  State  through  Advocate  General,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and 

another”,  2017  P.Cr.L.J  1435  [Lahore]  “Muhammad Safeer  and  another  VS The 

State  &  another”,  2017  P.Cr.L.J  699  [Lahore]  “Aurangzeb  alias  Guddu  VS The 

State” and  2010 SCMR 1604 “Mst. Askar  Jan &  others  VSMuhammad Daud  & 

others”.  

51. 

The  case  of  prosecution  is  based  upon  circumstantial  evidence,  last  seen  and 

recovery of stolen article as well as weapon of offence and pointation of dead body on the 

instance of appellants whereas it is the requirement of law to established that every piece 

 
30 

Criminal Appeal No.115/2016 
Criminal Appeal No.126/2016 
Jail Appeal No.114/2016 
Murder Reference No.06/2016 

of circumstantial evidence must fit in with other piece of such evidence in the chain and 

corroborate each other which link the accused at its own end and other with deceased but 

the chain of evidence is incomplete. The prosecution agency is under heavy mandate of 

collecting  evidence  against  the  accused  which  should  be  free  from  all  doubt  and 

suspicion failing which the conviction could not be sustained.  

52. 

In this case the motive of occurrence is shrouded in mystery, SMSs, CDR has not 

been justified, the allegation of abduction is just an opinion of complainant even the car 

allegedly used in the said incident has not been linked in the entire case, recovery of dead 

body has been disbelieved and the complainant never disclosed the details of  jewelry at 

the time of registration of FIR tried to improve her case through supplementary statement 

in order to link the appellant with the said articles but no concrete evidence was brought 

on  record.  The  place  of  recovery  is  situated  at  Bani  Gala  which  was  already  in  the 

knowledge of PW-6/ Sikandar Ali, Constable, who has already reached at the dead body 

prior  to  identification  and  pointation  of  deadbody  by  appellant  Moaz  Waqar.  House  of 

appellant Moaz Waqar was remained opened and inhabited and same house was used for 

four  different  occasions  for  the  purpose  of  recovery  which  is  not  admissible  in  any 

circumstances,  therefore,  we  are  of  the  confirmed  view  that  prosecution  has  failed  to 

discharge their onus regarding murder of deceased Fahmina.  

53. 

In  view  of  above  background,  Criminal  Appeal  No.115/2016,  Criminal  Appeal 

No.126/2016 and Jail Appeal No.114/2016 are allowed, appellants Moaz Waqar and Asif 

Mehmood are acquitted from the charge and shall be released forthwith if not required in 

any other case. Murder Reference No.06/2016 is answered in negative and death sentence 

is not confirmed.
