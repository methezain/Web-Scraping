DATE OF HEARING:  

24-02-2016 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J.  Through  this  Regular  First  Appeal, 

appellant has challenged the judgment and decree dated 08.02.2013, passed 

by the Civil Judge, 1st Class (West), Islamabad whereby the suit for specific 

performance  of  agreement  and  permanent  injunction  filed  by  Respondent 

No. 1 was decreed by the Court.  

2. 

Brief  facts  narrated  in  appeal  are  that  Respondent  No.1  filed  suit  for 

Specific  performance  of  agreement  dated  23.07.2003  against  the  present 

appellant  before  the  Civil  Court  at  Islamabad  wherein  Respondent  No.1 

claimed  that  he  entered  into  agreement  to  sell  regarding  House  No.  251, 

Street  No.  33,  G-10/1,  Islamabad  on  23.07.2003  against  the  total  Sale 

Consideration  of  Rs.4,400,000/-  out  of  which  Rs.  1,000,000/-  was  paid 

through Pay Order and Rs.500,000/- was paid in cash, the remaining amount 

of  Rs.2,900,000/-  was  to  be  paid  within  two  months  from  the  date  of 

agreement  and  the  house  in question  was to  be  transferred  in  the  office  of 

CDA (Respondent No. 2). It was also mentioned by Respondent No.1 in the 

plaint  that  original  allotment  letter  was  handed  over  by  the  appellant  to 

respondent No.1 at the time of execution of agreement to sell. 

3. 

As  per  contents  of  the  plaint  Respondent  No.  1/plaintiff  further 

claimed that he approached the appellant within the stipulated period of two

months for the transfer of house and for necessary completion of formalities 

but the appellant has not visited the office of CDA rather Respondent No. 1 

himself approached the office of CDA (Respondent No. 2) and get issued the 

application  for  transfer  of  allotment  of  the  suit  house  on  22.10.2003. 

Respondent No. 1 further claimed that number of request were made to the 

appellant  for  the  transfer  of  suit  property  in  the  office  of  CDA  but  the 

appellant  delayed  the  matter  on  one  pretext  or  the  other.  Although,  it  was 

informed  that  the  said  transfer  application  is  valid  till  21.01.2004  but  the 

appellant made excuses for non-availability. Finally, Respondent No. 1 came 

to  know  that  appellant  is  trying  to  sell  the  suit  house  to  someone  else  on 

higher  price.  Finally  the  suit  was  decreed  vide  judgment  decree  dated 

08.02.2013 by Civil Judge (West), Islamabad.  

4. 

Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that Respondent No. 1 had 

badly failed to pay the balance Sale Consideration of agreement to sell dated 

23.07.2003  amounting  to  Rs.2,900,000/-  whereas  time  was  the  essence  of 

contract  under  Clause-2  of  the  agreement  (Ex.P1).  Respondent  No.  1 badly 

failed  to  arrange  the  balance  Sale  Consideration  of  Rs.2,900,000/-,  hence, 

agreement was cancelled and the amount was forfeited. Learned Counsel for 

the  appellant  further  contends  that  Respondent  No.1  has  not  issued  any 

notice  for  the  payment  of  balance  Sale  Consideration  rather  there  are  only 

oral  assertions  that  he  approached  the  appellant  for  execution  of  transfer 

application.  It  has  further  been  argued  that  according  to  Clause-4  of  the 

agreement (Ex.P1) if the seller failed to transfer the suit house  in favour of 

purchaser  or  withdraws  from  the  said  deal  he  would  be  responsible  to  pay 

the double amount of the received earnest money to the purchaser and even 

today  the  said  Clause  holds  the  field.  Learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant 

further  argued  that  Aftab  Ahmad  Khan  (PW-1)  admits  in  his  evidence  that 

balance  Sale  Consideration  of  Rs.  2,900,000/-  was  payable  within  two 

months  and  Respondent  No.1  on  the  request  of  appellant  got  issued  the 

 
3 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

transfer application form from CDA dated 22.10.2003 which was valid up to 

21.01.2004.  This  shows  that  plot  was  transferable  and  the  application  for 

transfer  was  issued  but  Respondent  No.1  failed  to  pay  the  balance  Sale 

Consideration between the said period which resulted into termination of the 

said  contract  as  time  is  the  essence  of  contract  in  such  situation.  Learned 

Counsel  for  the  appellant  further  argued  that  Gulistan  Khan  (PW-2)  who  is 

also witness of the agreement (Ex.P1) states that  said house is transferable 

within the period of two months and the amount  was to be paid within the 

two months from the date of agreement.  Said PW-2 also admitted in cross-

examination  by  using  word “we”  against  every  question  which  was  read  in 

juxtaposition with the testimony of appellant where she asserted that original 

deal was in fact made with Gulistan Khan (PW-2) and it is not Aftab Ahmad 

(PW-1)  the  front  man  of  the  deal.  Learned  Counsel  for  appellant  further 

states  that  Trial  Court  has  erred  while  passing  the  impugned  judgment  & 

decree as Respondent No.1 failed to show his bonafide willingness to pay the 

balance  Sale  Consideration  within  the  stipulated  period  nor  ever  issued  any 

letter,  legal  notice  to  that  effect,  hence,  it  can  safely  be  presumed  that 

Respondent No.1 had no intention to pay the balance Sale Consideration of 

Rs.2,900,000/- for which he had not prepared any draft, cheque in the name 

of  appellant  and  even  otherwise  he  had  not  requested  the  Learned  Trial 

Court for the deposit of the balance Sale Consideration and if he had done so 

at  the  time  of  filing  of  the  suit  the  matter  might  be  fructified  at  that  time, 

hence, Respondent No. 1 is not entitled for discretionary relief under Specific 

Relief Act, 1877. Learned Counsel for the appellant further  argued that PW-

1/ Plaintiff/Respondent No.1 admits the fact in the cross-examination that he 

was  ready  to  receive  back  the  double  amount  of  the  earnest  money  i.e. 

Rs.15,00,000/-,  hence  the  suit  was  not  maintainable  and  the  learned  Trial 

Court  ignored  such  a qualified  admission  which  resulted  into  cancellation  of 

entire  deal  of  Ex.P1.  In  last,  learned  Counsel  for  the  appellant  states  that 

 
4 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

they have suffered a huge financial loss due to non compliance  of terms  of 

agreement (Ex.P1) and if Respondent No. 1 had paid the amount of balance 

Sale  Consideration  of  Rs.  29,00,000/-  within  the  stipulated  period,  the 

appellant  could  finalize  his  agreement  to  sell  dated  02.06.2003  called  as 

Ex.D1  (regarding  purchase  of  another  property  i.e.,  House  No.185,  Street 

No.61,  Sector  I-8/3,  Islamabad)  whereas,  the  appellant  could  not  pay  the 

balance  sale  consideration  to  her  seller  within  stipulated  period,  hence,  she 

suffered a huge loss and her earnest money was forfeited.  

5. 

Conversely,  learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  No.  1  argued  that  the 

agreement  to  sell  (Ex.P1)  was  admitted  document  even  the  earnest  money 

was  admitted  on  record,  execution  of  agreement  to  sell  Ex.P1  and  original 

allotment letter of the suit house as Ex.P2 were produced in evidence which 

show due execution of the agreement, however, appellant failed to transfer 

suit property in the name of Plaintiff/Respondent No.1. Learned Counsel for 

Respondent No. 1 further states that the requirement to prove the contents 

and  the  execution  of  Ex.P1  were  duly  complied  with.  Even  otherwise,  the 

agreement  was  not  disputed  and  the  only  question  involved  relates  to  the 

proposition  that whether time is the essence of contract or not?  He 

further  argued  that  Respondent  No.1  has  deposited  the  balance  Sale 

Consideration by virtue of impugned judgment and decree dated 08.02.2013 

in  Court.  Learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  No.1  further  argued  that  the 

learned Trial Court has not directed Respondent No.1 to deposit the balance 

Sale  Consideration  in  Court  account,  hence  they  are  entitled  for  decree  for 

Specific Performance which was rightly granted by the learned Trial Court as 

the  transfer  application  form  was  got  issued  by  Respondent  No.1  from  the 

office of CDA (Respondent No. 2) which had the validity upto 21.01.2004 but 

the  appellant  intentionally  failed  to  appear  in  the  office  of  CDA  in  order  to 

cause loss to Respondent No.1.

7. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

From  the  perusal  of  record  it  has  been  transpired  that  agreement  to 

sell dated 23.07.2003 (Ex.P1) was admitted between the parties, receiving of 

amount of Rs.15,00,000/- (Rs. 10,00,000/- through Pay Order No. A064720 

dated 23.07.2003 drawn at ABL, G-10 Markaz, Islamabad) and Rs.500,000/- 

was acknowledged in para 1 of the agreement. It was also admitted between 

the  parties  that  amount  of  Rs.  29,00,000/-  was  to  be  paid  as  balance  Sale 

Consideration in terms of Clause-2 of the Ex.P1. 

8. 

In  order  to  understand  the  question  involved  in  the  present  Regular 

First Appeal, Clause-2 of Ex.P1 is reproduced below:- 

”That the purchaser shall be responsible to pay 
balance amount of sale consideration a sum of 
Rs.29,00,000/- (Rupees twenty nine lacs only) 
within two months from the signing date of this 
agreement, with fifteen days from the signing 
date of this agreement, at the time of transfer of 
the said house in his favor or in the favor of his 
nominee(s).”   

9. 

Hence,  the  Trial  Court  on  the  basis  of  divergent  pleadings  of  the 

parties  framed  the  following  issues  vide  order  dated  18.05.2011  are 

reproduced as follows:- 

1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to   get a

agreement  to  sell  dated  23.07.2003  against 
the  defendants  in  respect  of  suit  property? 
OPP 

2. If  the  above  issue  No.  1  is  proved  in 
affirmative,  then  whether  the  plaintiff  is 
entitled  to  get  a  decree  for  permanent  and 
mandatory injunction as prayed for? OPP 
3. Whether  the plaintiff  has  no  cause  of  action

7. Whether  the  suit  is  false,  frivolous  and 
vexatious,  hence  liable  to  be  dismissed  with 
special costs? OPD 

8. Relief.  

10. 

The learned Trial Court has given the findings only on issue No. 1 in 

order  to  resolve  the  controversy,  rest  of  the  issues  were  referred  to  the 

defendants  and  no  evidence  was  allegedly  produced  regarding  the  said 

issues,  therefore,  in  order  to  dilute  the  entire  controversy,  we  are  of  the 

opinion  that  issues  No.  1  to  6  should  be  discussed  collectively  and  findings 

on these issues be also given after putting the issues in juxtaposition.  

FINDINGS ON ISSUES NO. 1 to 6 

11. 

As 

per  Clause-4 

of 

Ex.P1 

(agreement 

to 

sell 

dated  

23-07-2003), 

it 

is  admitted  between 

the  parties 

that  amount  of                

Rs.  29,00,000/-  as  balance  Sale  Consideration  was  to  be  paid  within  two 

months  from  the  date  of  execution  of  the  agreement  (Ex.P1).  However, 

Respondent No.1 never issued any notice to the appellant that he was ready 

to comply with the said term, the interpretation of the said Clause has to be 

seen with reference to evidence recorded by PW-1 &2 whereupon the PW-1 

in  his  examination  in  chief  states  that  the  amount  of  Rs.  29,00,000/-  is 

payable within two months to Respondent No.  1, when she transferred said 

house  in  the  office  of  CDA  in  favour  of  Respondent  No.  1  and  for  the  said 

purpose  he  has  to  get  issued  the transfer  application  on  22.10.2013,  which 

was  valid  uptil  21.01.2004.  Although  the  same  was  not  reflected  in  the 

agreement to sell dated 23.04.2003 (Ex.P1) as it  was  not  the  obligation of    

Respondent  No.  1  to  do  the  act,  by  managing  issuance  of  transfer 

application,  he  admits  the  obligation  of  Clause-4  (Ex.P1)  in  which  balance 

Sale  Consideration  was  payable  within  the  period  of  two  months  from  the 

date of agreement i.e. 23.07.2003 whereas the transfer application form was 

issued  on  22.10.2003,  hence  it  is  safely  assumed  that  the  period  of  two 

months  was  already  elapsed  and  even  thirty  (30)  days  time  after  the  said 

 
 
7 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

period  was  also  consumed  in  the  fulfillment  of  said  obligation,  however, 

there  is  no  evidence  produced  by  Respondent  No.1,  through  which  he  can 

prove that any effort was ever made by him to show his readiness to pay the 

balance Sale Consideration to the appellant.  

12. 

From  the  perusal  of  written  statement  and  the  evidence  of  the 

appellant a question of balance Sale Consideration was specifically raised by 

the  appellant  in  para  5  stating  therein  that  balance  Sale  Consideration  was 

not  paid  in  the  stipulated  period  of  two  months.  Even  otherwise,  the 

appellant  had  handed  over  the  original  allotment  letter  dated  23.04.1998 

(Ex.P2) to Respondent No. 1 at the time of execution of Ex.P1 which shows 

that  she  was  willing  to  perform  her  part  of  contract.  When  the  said  fact  is 

read  together  with  the  issuance  of  transfer  application  form  on  22.10.2003 

admitted by Respondent No. 1/PW-1 in his examination in chief, these facts 

jointly give rise to a chain of evidence against Respondent No. 1 that he has 

not put his efforts to pay the balance Sale Consideration within the stipulated 

period of two months. 

13. 

The  controversial  question  in  the  entire  suit  is  as  to  whether  the 

“time is the essence of contract or not?”,  Normally  time  is  not  the 

essence  of  contract  as  certain  obligations  have  to  be  performed  before  the 

application of time clause which were imposed through the agreement upon 

the  seller/vendor,  who  was  responsible  to  provide  all  such  documents, 

material  and  requirements  for  the  completion  of  sale  by  means  of  transfer 

before the transferring authority i.e. CDA (in the present case). 

14. 

If  the  obligations  upon  the  seller/appellant  were  not  adhered  to,  the 

time does not start ticking but in present case:- 

i.  Original allotment letter of the suit property 
(Ex.P2) was handed over to the Respondent 
No.1. 

ii.  Application for transfer for suit property was 
got issued on 22.10.2003 as claimed by 
Respondent No. 1 /PW-1 Aftab Ahmad Khan. 

 
8 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

iii.  No notice was ever issued by Respondent 
No.  1  to  the  appellant  asking  for  the 
completion  of  transfer  procedure  in  the 
office of CDA. 

iv.  No document was ever produced before the 
Trial Court in order to show the balance Sale 
Consideration readiness to pay by means of 
Bank  Draft,  Cross  Cheque  or  Bank 
Statement. 

v.  Respondent No. 1 has not put any effort by 
submitting any application before the Trial 
Court for the deposit of Sale Consideration 
ever from filing of suit i.e., 01-11-2004 to 
08-02-2013 end of trial.          

15. 

From  the  appreciation  of  above  facts  it  is  clear  that  if  the  time  is 

essence  of  contract  i.e.  issuance  of  application  for  transfer  form  issued  by 

the  CDA  (Respondent  No.  2)  which  was  admitted  by  the  PW-1  in  his 

examination in chief and at the same time Ex.P2 original allotment letter was 

with  Respondent  No.  1  who  had  produced the  same  before  the  Trial  Court, 

which shows that respondent No.1 had the full authority to get the property 

transferred  only  by  asking  the  appellant  for  her  appearance  before  the 

Admitting  Officer,  CDA.  When  the  requirements  of  the  transfer  were 

completed,  the  time  which  is  the  essence,  starts  ticking  on  the  clock,  even 

PW-1  has  never placed  any  copy  of  pay  order  through  which  he  can  justify 

that appellant ever refused to transfer the suit property neither any Challan 

or  pay  order  regarding  transfer  fee  has  been  prepared,  which  was  the 

responsibility of Respondent No.1 in terms of Clause-6 of Ex.P1. In order to 

understand the true meaning of term “time is the essence of contract”. 

The  words  used  in  clause  2  of  Ex.P1  agreement  has  to  be  understood 

especially “responsible to pay”, “within” and “from” which show the duty 

of  purchaser/respondent  No.1  Aftab  Ahmad  Khan  to  pay  the  balance  sale 

consideration  of  Rs.2,900,000/-  within  two  months  from  signing  of  this 

agreement  Ex.P1,  the  direct  meaning  conveyed  from  the  said  sentence 

clearly puts heavy onus upon respondent No.1 to pay the amount thereafter 

any other part has to be performed but respondent No.1 failed to do so. 

 
 
9 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

16. 

Clause  No.2  of  Ex.P1  refers  two  different  time  lines  firstly  within  02 

months, secondly with fifteen days from the signing date of this agreement, 

which  shows  the  ambiguity  regarding  time  clause,  therefore,  we  are  of  the 

opinion  that  2  months  time  from  the  date  of  agreement  i.e.,  23-07-2003  is 

the  correct  interpretation  of  said  clause.  Even  otherwise  the  due  balance 

payments are always received by the seller before transfer of the property in 

accordance  with  prevailing  marketing  practices  rather  sellers  do  not  record 

their  statements  for  transfer  before  transferring  authority  prior  to  receiving 

of balance sale consideration. 

17. 

From  above,  it  is  manifestly  clear  that  words  “within”  and  “from” 

are indicative of the fact that time was indeed the essence being outer limit 

of  time  in  which  payment  was  to  be  made.  Reliance  is  placed  on  2015 

SCMR 828, “Adil Tiwana and others VSShaukat Ullah Bangash”. 

“Failure  of  plaintiff  to  pay  balance  consideration 
before  agreed  time---Effect---Wording  of  the 
agreement to sell showed that a specific date for 
making payment of the balance (consideration) was 
mentioned, which date was the absolute limit---Said 
specific date was indeed the essence being the outer 
limit of time within which payment was to be made.” 

From the perusal of evidence following admitted facts comes on record:- 

(a) 

 Agreement  Ex.P1  executed  on  23-07-2003  regarding  House 
No.251,    St.No.33, measuring 30x60, Sector G-10/1, Islamabad 
owned by appellant.  

(b)  Total  sale  consideration  of  the  suit  house  was  fixed  at 
Rs.4,400,000/-, earnest money was paid by respondent No.1 
Rs.1,500,000/-  balance  payable  by  respondent  No.1  is 
Rs.2,900,000/-. 

  (c)   Time for balance payment was 2 months from 23-07-2003. 
(d)  Original allotment letter Ex.P2 dated 23 April 1998 was given by 
appellant  to  respondent  No.1  at  the  time  of  execution  of 
agreement to sell Ex.P1. 

(e)  Transfer   application   form was issued from the office of CDA on 
22-10-2003  which  was  valid  upto  21-01-2004  (admitted  by 
respondent No.1). 

(f)  No written notice was ever issued by both the parties for  
       performance of their part of contract. 
(g)  No proof of readiness of payment of balance sale consideration of 
Rs.2,900,000/- was prepared by respondent No.1 or any proof that 
respondent No.1 has the balance sale consideration with him has 
not been placed on record. 

 
 
10 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

 (h)  Respondent No.1 admits that if appellant is not willing to transfer 
the house in his name then appellant had to pay the double 
amount of earnest money. 

(i)  Respondent No.1 failed to place his bank statement on record for 

the year 2003. 

(j)  Respondent  No.1  was  responsible  to  pay  balance  sale 

consideration of Rs.2,900,000/- within 2 months of Ex.P1. 

(k)     Suit was filed by respondent No.1 on 01-11-2004 wherein last date  
      of submission of transfer application form was 22-01-2004. 
(l)      PW-2 respondent No.1 brother who was property dealer admits that  
   sale consideration was to be paid by respondent No.1 to appellant  
   within 02  months. 

   (m)   No male member of family of appellant was present at the time of      

agreement to sell only respondent No.1, PW-2, PW-3 were present 
with appellant. 

  (n)    Suit was filed only due to increase in prices manifolds during the  

  said period. 

18. 

From the above mentioned facts brought on record learned Trial Court 

has wrongly decided the main issue No.1 vide his findings in para Nos. 12 to 

15,  whereby,  Trial  Court  has  observed  in  the  judgment  that  clause  No.2  of 

Ex.P1  is  very  ambiguous  regarding  time  of  02  months  or  15  days  but  has 

given no findings to that extent even no reason has been mentioned in the 

impugned  judgment,  the  entire  findings  are  in  para  No.14  which  is 

reproduced as under:- 

“14.  The defendant No.1 has admitted the execution of 
the agreement and she has also admitted in cross 
examination  that  she  received  Rs.10,00,000/- 
through pay order and Rs.500,000/- in cash from the 
plaintiff  and  the  plaintiff  is  ready  to  pay  the 
remaining sale consideration to the defendant No.1.” 

Hence  the  Trial  Court  erred  while  giving  above  mentioned  findings  without 

considering 

the 

evidence 

available 

on 

record.  Moreover, 

the 

plaintiff/respondent No.1  when  appeared as PW-1 and admitted the fact in 

the following words:- 

______________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________

__________   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

Which clearly demonstrate that time is  the essence of contract and wherein 

period fixed between the parties  was of two months in terms of clause 2 of 

Ex.P1, even the other witness PW-2 who is brother of PW-1 also admits:- 

______________________________________________________________

______________________________________________________________

19.   Hence, it is admitted by plaintiff/respondent No.1 and his only witness 

in  clear  terms  that  time  for  payment  was  fixed  within  2  months  from        

23-07-2003,  the  final  time  for  payment  was  concluded  as  23-09-2003 

whereas,  the  application  for  transfer  was  got  issued  on  22-10-2003  as 

evident from PW-1 testimony but no effort was made for further completion 

of  terms.  Even  the  suit  was  filed  on  01-11-2004  almost  after  one  year  and 

two months of the date fixed for the balance sale consideration which shows 

the unfair conduct of respondent No.1. It is admitted by respondent No.1 in 

his  evidence  to  receive  back  the  double  of  the  earnest  money  in  following 

words:-

This  shows  the  unwillingness  of  respondent  No.1  towards  performance  of 

agreement  Ex.P1  rather  he  was  interested  to  claim  double  the  amount  of 

earnest money, hence reliance is placed on:- 

2010 SCMR 286 Muhammad Hussain & others VSDr. Zahoor Alam. 

“There are various parameters presented by Hon’ble Supreme 
Court  in  various  pronouncements  to  refuse  to  exercise 
equitable discretionary relief in favour of the appellant on the 
following well known maxims” 
(i)  He who seeks equity must come with clean hands.      
(ii)  Law favors who are vigilant qua their rights.  
(iii)  The  purpose  of  exercising  the  discretionary 
jurisdiction is to see the Justice is rendered according 
to the rules of equity and good conscience. 

Matters for consideration for the exercise of discretion are: bad 
faith,  dishonesty,  unreasonableness  of  the  decision  and 
constitutional remedies being extraordinary, no one is entitled

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

to  claim  as  of  right  exercise  of  discretionary  power.             
“Haji Saifullah Khan’s case PLD 1989 SC 166”. 

20.  We  are  of  the  considered  opinion  that  respondent  No.1  failed  to 

perform  the  agreement  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  especially  to  arrange 

payment of balance sale consideration which is evident from entire evidence, 

hence, the findings on Issue No. 1 have been reversed and respondent No. 1 

has  no  cause  of  action  to  file  the  suit  for  Specific  Performance  as  he  has 

been  estopped  by  his  words  and  conduct.  Even  he  is  not  entitled  for 

discretionary  relief  of  Specific  Performance  on  the  ground  that  he  has  not 

come to the Court with clean hands, therefore, Issues No. 3 to 6 have been 

proved  against  respondent  No.  1,  in  view  of  above,  this  appeal  is  allowed. 

Judgment and decree dated 08.02.2013 are hereby set-aside. 

We  have  observed  following  reasons  which  are  the  key  features  in  decision 

of any suit for specific performance to be made basis:- 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

Plaintiff/purchaser  had  to  prove  his  readiness  to  pay 
Balance  Sale  Consideration  on  record  by  means  of  deposit 
of balance amount in Court at the earliest i.e. at the time of 
filing of suit (if not paid earlier). 
All actions & efforts to pay balance sale consideration  must 
be  seen  on  record,  even  time  is  the  essence  or  not  or 
conditional  with  any  other  clause,  obligation  or  terms  of 
agreement.  Reliance  is  placed  on  1999  SCMR  1362,  2015 
SCMR 828 and 2015 SCMR 21. 
If  the  Balance  Sale  Consideration  has  been  paid  on  record 
at the time of filing of the suit by the plaintiff at his own, his 
conduct  should  be  treated  as  bonafide,  prompt,  fair, 
confirming  his  readiness  which  entitles  him  for  equitable 
relief of Specific Performance, even at the stage of decision 
of the application U/O 39, Rule 1&2 CPC. 

21.  

If  respondent  No.1  pays  the  balance  amount  within  the  period  as 

agreed or deposited in Court at the time of filing of suit the matter would be 

settled  there  and  then  but  he  was  not  interested  to  perform  his  part  of 

contract,  hence,  appeal  is  hereby  accepted,  the  judgment  &  decree  dated 

08-02-2013  is  set-aside,  suit  of  the  plaintiff  is  dismissed.  However,  the 

amount  of  earnest  money  of  Rs.1,500,000/-  which  was  received  by  the 

appellant and same was also acknowledged and admitted, shall be returned 

 
 
 
13 

R.F.A No. 53/2013 

to respondent No.1 with double rate in terms of clause-4 of Ex.P1. Appellant 

is directed to deposit the amount of Rs. 30,00,000/- in the Trial Court within 

one  month.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2015  SCMR  21,  Muhammad  Iqbal 

VS Mehboob Alam. 

“use of the money for such long period the respondent obviously 
stands enriched; the currency has devalued while the value of the 
suit property has considerably increased. If the said amount was 
not withdrawn and was invested by the Court in some profit 
bearing scheme of the Government, the amount would have been 
doubled by now,”
