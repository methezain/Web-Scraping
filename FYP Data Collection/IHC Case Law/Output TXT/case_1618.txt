Mr. Shah Noor Khan Khattak, learned ASC.  

 Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  petitioner 

(Mst. Saira) calls in question an inaction on the part 

of respondents 1&2 (SSP, ICT and SHO P.S. Tarnol), 

whereby  on  her  application,  the  latter  refused  to 

register  an  FIR  against  the  proposed  accused/ 

respondents 3 to 5.  

2. 

The 

facts,  relevant 

for  adjudication  of 

instant  writ  petition,  are  that  petitioner  filed  an 

application  to  the  respondent  No.2  (SHO  P.S. 

Tarnol)  with  the  allegations  that  on  20.06.2020  at 

about 8:15 am, respondents 3 to 5/police officials 

of P.S. Tarnol trespassed in the house; conducted 

search  without  any  warrant  and  in  that  pursuit 

took away Rs.80,000/- lying in the house and also 

Rs.20,000/-  from  her  purse;  that  the  proposed 

accused  also  gave  severe  beating  to  her  spouse 

and took him away to the police station, where he 

was  kept in  illegal  confinement and  was  released 

after  about  three  hours  after  taking 

illegal 

gratification of Rs.30,000/-. The petitioner alleged 

that the proposed accused not only transgressed 

their  authority  but  also  ruined  the  sanctity  of  the 

abode  which  has  duly  been  reported  to  the  high-

ups/respondents  1&2  but  to  no  avail,  hence  the 

instant writ petition.

                                         -2- 

3. 

Learned  counsel  contends  that  during  the 

occurrence, the proposed accused also extended 

threats  to  involve  family  of  the  petitioner  in  fake 

cases  if  she  avails  legal  remedies  against  them. 

Learned  counsel  prays  for  acceptance  of  writ 

petition in terms of the relief prayed therein.  

4. 

5. 

Heard and examined the record.  

At  the  very  outset,  question  arises  as  to 

whether 

in  presence  of  an  alternate  and 

efficacious  remedy  under  Section  22-A  (6)  of  the 

Criminal  Procedure  Code,  1898  (“the  Code”), 

direct resort to writ petition for the registration of 

an  FIR 

is  competent.  When  confronted,  the 

learned  counsel  submits  that 

in  the 

light  of 

judgment reported as NLR 2006 79, the petitioner 

can  approach  the  High  Court  directly  instead  of 

availing  remedy  before  the  learned  Justice  of 

Peace  at  the  first 

instance,  as  contained 

in 

Section 22 A & B of the Code.  

6. 

 Before  insertion  of  Section  22-A(6)  of  the 

Code, there were number of applications/petitions 

pending  before  respective  High  Courts  against 

inaction,  negligence  and  delay  on  the  part  of 

police  authorities,  particularly  against  the  office 

of the SHO for non-registration of criminal cases. 

The general public was constrained/ compelled to 

approach 

the 

respective  High  Courts 

for 

redressal  of  their  grievances  and  in  many  cases 

people  could  not  approach the High  Court  due  to 

the  fact  that  the  High  Courts  were/  are 

in 

provincial  headquarters  and  in  some  big  cities 

their  respective  Benches  were  also  available.  It 

was  not  feasible  for  every  citizen  to  reach  the 

respective High Court, its Benches due to hazards 

of long travelling.

                                         -3- 

7. 

The 

legislature  by  realizing 

this 

fact, 

keeping  in  view  the  difficulties  of  the  citizens, 

introduced  an  amendment  through  Ordinance 

CXXXI  of  2002,  whereby  Section  22-A  (6)  of  the 

Code was  inserted which, for ease of reference is 

reproduced below:- 

[(6)   An ex-officio justice of the peace may issue 
appropriate  directions  to  the  police  authorities 
concerned on a complaint regarding— 

(i)       Non-registration of a criminal case; 

(ii)      Transfer  of  investigation  from  one  police 

officer to another; and 

(iii)    Neglect,  failure  or  excess  committed  by  a 
police  authority  in  relation  to  its  functions 
and duties.] 

Under  the  scheme  ibid,  the  learned  Sessions 

Judges  in  every  district,  the  Additional  Sessions 

Judges/Duty  Judges  in  the  Tehsil  headquarters 

were  bestowed  with  powers  to  entertain  and 

decide  the  applications  and  to  pass  appropriate 

directions  to  the  police  authorities  in  terms  of 

Section  22-A  (6)  supra.  To  that  extent,  the 

beneficial  and  purposeful 

legislation  provided 

remedy to the citizens at their door steps instead 

of approaching the provincial headquarters or the 

respective  Benches.  The  purpose  was  very 

obvious, that if any criminal act is committed with 

any  citizen  and  on his/her  report police remained 

negligent  or  show  inaction,  then  remedy  to  said 

individual/citizen  is  available  at  the  door  step  i.e. 

the District/(Tehsil level). 

8. 

Now  coming  to  the  case  at  hand  and 

applying  above  stated  legislative  intent,  if  in  the 

year  2020,  a  High  Court  exercises 

its 

constitutional 

jurisdiction  directly 

regarding 

inaction on the part of police authorities, it would 

amount  to  travel  back  in  the  past,  therefore, 

 
 
 
Writ Petition No.1648/2020 

                                         -4- 

instead  of  moving/regressing  towards  the  past,  it 

is most appropriate, being constitutional court, to 

follow 

the 

intent  behind 

the  edict  of 

the 

legislature. Therefore, a remedy is available to the 

petitioner to approach the forum of  the Justice of 

Peace instead of moving the High Court directly. 

If  this  Court  assumes  jurisdiction,  same  is 

not  legally  warranted  rather  would  amount  to 

abridge 

the  wisdom  and 

intention  of 

the 

legislature.  

9. 

Even  otherwise,  for  availing  remedy  before 

this  Court 

in 

terms  of  Article  199  of 

the 

Constitution, there is a mandatory requirement for 

the  petitioner  to  show,  that  there  is  no  alternate 

efficacious  and  adequate  remedy  and  when  the 

remedy  by  way  of  an  application  under  Section 

22- A (6) of the Code is available, which is not only 

efficacious but adequate as well, then writ petition 

is  not  maintainable.  In  this  respect,  reliance  is 

placed  upon  case  of  Malik  Khalid  Mehmood  VS 

Inspector  General  of  Police  Punjab  and  others 

(2002  PCr.LJ  1613),  Fida  Hussain  VS  The  State 

(1975  SCMR  150)  and  Abdul  Wahid  Khan  VS 

Government  of  the  Punjab  and  others  (PLD  1989 

SC 508).  

10.  The  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned 

counsel  relates  to  a  dispute  of  civil  nature  and 

was  not  a  criminal  case.  It  was  also  held  in  the 

said case that in presence of alternate efficacious 

remedy  writ  petition 

is  not  maintainable, 

therefore,  the  referred  citation  does  not  extend 

any  help  to  the  petitioner  rather  is  in  negation  of 

the argument put forth by learned counsel for the 

petitioner.

                                         -5- 

11. 

 In  the  light  of  aforementioned  reasons, 

there is no force in the instant writ petition, hence, 

same 

is  dismissed 

in 

limine,  however, 

the 

petitioner  shall  be  at 

liberty  to  avail  other 

remedies,  available  to  her  under  the  law,  if  so 

advised.
