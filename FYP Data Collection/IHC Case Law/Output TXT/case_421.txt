Learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents 
(Mr.  Muhammad  Waqas  Malik,  Advocate)  has 
explained  that  Petitioner  No.1  is  widow  and 
Petitioner  No.2  is  minor  son  of  Syed  Ali 
Ehtisham,  the  deceased,  whereas,  Respondent 
No.1  is  the  mother  and  Respondents  No.2 to 4 
are  siblings  of  the  deceased.  It  appears  that 
there is  multiple litigation going on between the 
parties on various issues including guardianship 
of  the  minor  as well as share in various assets 
of  the  deceased.  Currently,  guardianship  and 
custody  of  the  minor  is  with  the  mother  who 
has also challenged the  visitation rights granted 
to  the  grandmother,  uncle  and  aunt.  On the last 
several  dates,  learned  counsel  for  the  parties 
stated 
in  the  process  of 
negotiation,  however,  on  the  last  date  such 
negotiation  has failed.
