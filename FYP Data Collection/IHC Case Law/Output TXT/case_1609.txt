GHULAM AZAM  QAMBRANI, J 

The  petitioner  [Tariq  Masud]  seeks  cancellation 

of bail granted  in  favour  of accused/  respondents  1  & 

2, in case FIR No. 435/2019, dated 23.12.2019, under 

sections 324/34/109 PPC, registered at Police Station 

Shalimar, Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts of the case are that the complainant/ 

petitioner  lodged the  FIR with  the  allegations  that  on 

23.12.2019 at about 7:30  PM, four  unknown accused 

having  ages  of  25/30  years,  intercepted  him  in  the 

area  of  Sector  F-11 /1,  where  on  refusal  of  handing 

over  of  a  bag  containing  documents  to  them,  they 

caused severe injuries with daggers on  different parts 

of his body for his murder, hence the instant FIR. 

3. 

Learned counsel for the  petitioner submits that 

the  order  of  learned  Trial  Court  is  not  only  perverse 

but shocking in the  perspective of the matter in hand; 

that  the  accused  were  directly  nominated  who  had 

planted  the  persons  for  their  own  larger  interests 

implicit  in  the  numerous  civil  and  criminal  litigation; 

that  the  petitioner  remained  hospitalized  for  a  period 

of  around  two  weeks  in  critical  condition;  that  the 

impugned  order  has  been  passed  without  applying 

the 

independent 

judicial  mind; 

that  accused/ 

respondent  No.1  is  misusing  the  concession  of  bail 

and constantly harassing the petitioner and his family. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents  1  &  2  contended that the  only allegation 

2 

CRL.MISC.  N0.166-BC  /2020 

against  respondents  1  &  2  is  of  abetment  which  falls 

under section  109  PPC; that there  is  no evidence  on 

record  against  the  respondents; 

that  the  accused/ 

respondents did not misuse the concession of bail nor 

did  they  ever  threatened  the  complainant  in  any 

manner;  that  the  FIR  has  been  lodged  against  them 

on  the  basis  of  false  and  baseless  allegations.  The 

learned State Counsel opposed  the  contention  of the 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  supported  the 

bail granting order passed by the learned Trial Court. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Minute  perusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the 

complainant  has  levelled  the  allegation  of  abetment 

against  the  respondents.  There  is  nothing  on  record 

to  show  that  in  whose  presence  the  abetment  was 

made  by 

the 

respondents,  whereas  only 

the 

statement  of 

the  complainant/petitioner 

is  not 

sufficient,  unless  there  is  strong  piece  of  evidence 

available  on  record.  The  petitioner  is  employee  of 

Hamad Chaudhary who  is  nephew of the  respondent 

No.1  namely  Sikandar  Zaman  Chaudhary.  Civil  and 

criminal  litigation is  pending  between the  parties with 

regard to the property left by Ch. Muhammad Ramzan 

(deceased).  As  such,  possibility  of  false  involvement 

of the respondents in  the instant case cannot be ruled 

out.  Keeping 

in 

view  all 

these 

facts  and 

circumstances,  the  learned  Trial  Court  had  rightly 

confirmed the pre-arrest bail to the respondents. 

7. 

Prima 

facie,  no 

incriminating  material 

is 

available on record against the  respondents. The guilt 

or  otherwise  of  the  accused/  respondents  shall  be 

determined after recording of prosecution evidence by 

the learned trial Court. The petitioner failed to bring on 

record any  report with  regard to  extending  of threats 

or misuse of the concession of bail. 

8. 

The  considerations  for  the  grant  of  bail  are 

quite  different 

from 

the  considerations 

for 

the 

cancellation  of bail.  Once  bail has  been granted  by a 

competent  Court  of  law,  strong  and  exceptional 

grounds are required for cancelling the same.  In  such 

cases,  it  is  to  be  seen  as  to  whether  order  granting 

3 

CRL.MISC.  N0.166-BC  /2020 

bail  is  patently  illegal,  erroneous,  factually  incorrect 

and  has 

resulted 

in  miscarriage  of 

justice. 

Considering  the  case  of  present  respondents  for  the 

grant  of  bail  on  the  above  touchstone,  I  am  of  the 

view 

that 

the 

learned  Sessions  Judge-West, 

Islamabad has rightly exercised the grant of bail to the 

respondents. 

9. 

The  petitioner  has  also  failed  to  point  out 

whether  after  grant  of  bail  the  accused/  respondents 

have  tampered  with  the  prosecution  evidence  or 

misused the concession of bail. In  this  regard reliance 

has  been placed on  the  Judgments titled  "The  State 

VS  Khalid  Mehmood"  [2006  SCMR  1265]  &  "  Ahsan 

Akbar VS The State" [ 2007 SCMR 482]. 

10. 

For  the 

foregoing  reasons,  no  reasonable 

ground~ exist 

for  cancellation  of  bail  granted  to  the 

accused/  respondents,  therefore,  the  instant  petition 

being devoid of force, is  hereby dismissed. 

11. 

However, the  observations  made  hereinabove 

are  meant for  disposal of this  application, which  shall 

have no  bearing on  merits of the case.
