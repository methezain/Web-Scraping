Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel where necessary. 
Raja Amir Shahzad, advocate for the petitioners. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioners 

impugn  the 

judgment  dated 

29.07.2021,  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned 

Additional 

District 

Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  their  appeal  against 

the  order  dated  11.06.2021,  passed  by  the 

learned  Executing  Court  was  dismissed. 

Vide  said  order  dated  11.06.2021,  the 

learned  Executing  Court  dismissed  the 

petitioners’  application  for  recording  the 

statement  of  the  minor  (Muhammad  Musa 

Hashim Khan) so that the visitation rights of 

the  minor’s  father  are  altered  and  the 

minor  is  not  taken  to  his  father’s  native 

village.  

2.  The  visitation  schedule  was  fixed  vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated  21.11.2019, 

passed by the learned Guardian Judge. It is 

well  settled 

that 

the  Executing  Court 

cannot  go  behind  the  decree.  Additionally, 

in  the  instant  case,  the  petitioners’  earlier 

application  for  recording  of  the  minor’s 

statement  had  been  dismissed  vide  order 

dated 02.01.2021. After this, the petitioners 

have  tried  to  make  a  second  attempt  to 

have  the  minor’s  statement  recorded  with 

the 

intention  of  altering  the  visitation 

schedule  and  the  place  of  visitation.  This 

 
                
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cannot  be  done 

in 

the  execution 

proceedings.  

3. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  writ 

petition  is  dismissed  in  limine.  Let  writ 

petition No.3244/2020 be fixed in the month 

of October, 2021.
