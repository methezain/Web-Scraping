Mr.  Awais  Haider  Malik,  State  Counsel

for 

The  petitioner,  Zeeshan  Tahir 

s/o 

Tahir  Masood,  seeks  bail  after  arrest 

in 

case  FIR  No.358  dated  17.09.2019 

for 

offence 

under 

section 

376(ii) 

PPC 

registered  at  P.S.  Sehala,  Islamabad. 

2. 

The  case  of  the  prosecution,  against 

the  petitioner, 

is 

that  on  complaint  of 

respondent  No.2,  the  petitioner  was  booked 

in  the  above  mentioned  FIR,  wherein  it  has 

been  alleged  that  petitioner,  along  with  his 

accomplice,  committed  offence  of  rape  with 

minor  daughter 

of  complainant 

namely 

Haya  Ali. 

3. 

The  petitioner  applied  for  bail  after 

arrest  which  was  dismissed  by  the  learned 

Crl.  Misc.  No.777-B-2019 

2 

Additional  Sessions  Judge,  Islamabad-West 

vide  order  dated  07.12.2019. 

4. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner, 

inter  alia,  contended 

that  there  is  a  delay  of 

about  more  than  a  month  in  registration  of 

FIR;  that  there  is  no  explanation 

for  delay 

in  registration  of  FIR;  that  DNA analysis  of 

semen  is  still  awaited; 

that  in  the  medical 

examination,  date  of  alleged  occurrence 

is 

vague;  that  there  are  no  violence  marks  or 

laceration  or  bleeding. 

It  was  submitted 

that  it  was  alleged  during  investigation 

that 

victim  became  pregnant  which  was  aborted 

but  there  is  no  medical  report  indicating 

that  she  was  taken  to  any  medical  doctor 

for  the  same.  It  was  contended 

that  under 

facts  and  circumstances 

the  case  against 

the  petitioner  is  one  of  further  inquiry. 

5. 

Learned  State  Counsel  along  with 

learned  counsel  for  the  complainant, 

inter 

alia,  contended 

that  delay  in  lodging  of  FIR 

was  due  to  family  considerations 

to  protect 

honor;  that  offence  was  committed  by  the 

petitioner; 

that  weapon  of  offence  i.e.  pistol 

Crl. Misc. No.777-B-2019 

3 

nominated  with  specific  role;  that  delay  in 

such  like  cases  is  immaterial.  Reliance  was 

placed  on  Mukhtiar  Ali  v.  The  State  (2018 

YLR  17 43),  Zahid  Iqbal  v.  The  State  (2009 

YLR  356),  Nasreen  Bibi  v.  Farrukh  Shahzad 

(2015  SCMR  825),  Rashad  v.  The  State 

(2002  SCMR 1329)  and  Mst.  Yasmin  Butt  v. 

Majid Baig  (2008  SCMR 1602). 

6. 

Arguments 

advanced 

by 

learned 

counsels 

for  the  parties  have  been  heard 

and 

the  documents, 

placed  on 

record, 

examined  with  their  able  assistance. 

7. 

The  petitioner 

is 

imputed 

for 

the 

offence  mentioned  hereinabove. 

8. 

Admittedly,  there  is  a  delay  of  more 

than  a  month  in  lodging  of  above  FIR,  for 

which,  there  is  no  explanation. 

9. 

The  physical 

examination 

of 

the 

victim  was 

conducted 

belatedly 

on 

17.09.2019, 

in  which,  date  of  assault  has 

been  mentioned  as  13/14  of  August,  2019. 

The 

report  also 

indicates 

that  hymen 

rupture  was  old  and  there  is  no  bleeding  or 

laceration  in the  vaginal  area. 

Crl. Misc. No.777-B-2019

10.  The 

sample  was 

taken 

for  DNA 

analysis  however  as  per  the  investigation 

agency,  result  is  awaited. 

11.  The 

above 

facts  make 

the 

case 

against 

the  petitioner 

one  of 

further 

inquiry. 

12.  Even-otherwise,  case  law  relied  upon 

by  learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

is 

instructive 

inasmuch  as  in  case  reported  as 

'Parvaiz  and  another  VS  The  State  and 

another' 

(2014  P.Cr.LJ  599), 

the  Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court  observed 

that  where 

semen  found  on  vaginal  swabs  of  the  victim 

would  lose 

its  evidentiary  value.  Similar 

view  was 

taken 

in  a  cases  reported  as 

'Mukhtar  Ahmad  VS  The  State  and  another' 

(2012  YLR  2228)  and  Shahnaz  Bibi  VS  The 

State  (1997  MLD  1333). 

13.  Even  otherwise, 

investigation 

stands 

completed  and  the  petitioner 

is  no  longer 

required  for  the  same. 

14.  As  noted  above 

that 

there 

is  no 

justification  for  delay  in  lodging  of  FIR. The 

cases, 

like 

the  present  one,  are  based 

primarily  on  circumstantial 

evidence 

and 

Crl. Misc. No.777-B-2019 

5 

that  too,  medical.  The  delay  in  registration 

of  FIR  loses  efficacy  of  evidence.  Though 

there 

is  some  case 

law  relied  upon  by 

learned  counsel 

for  the  complainant 

that 

delay 

is 

inconsequential 

but 

the  recent 

trend  of 

judgments 

of 

the  Honourable 

Supreme  Court 

is  otherwise.  Reliance 

is 

placed  on  Haibat  Khan  VS  The  State  (2016 

SCMR  2176)  and  Muhammad  Tanvir  VS 

The  State  (2017  SCMR 366).  Moreover,  the 

Honourable 

Supreme 

Court 

in 

case 

reported  as  Manzoor  VS  The  State  (PLD 

1972  SC  81)  observed  as  follows: 

"It  is  important to remember  that 

bail is  not  to  be  withheld as  a 

punishment. There  is  no  legal  or 

moral compulsion to  keep  people 

in  jeil  merely  on  the  allegation 

that they have committed offences 

punishable  with 

death 

or 

transportation, unless  reasonable 

grounds  appear 

to  exist 

to 

disclose  their  complicity.  The 

ultimate 

conviction 

and 

incarceration of  a  guilty  person 

can repair the  wrong caused by a 

mistaken  relief  of  interim  bsil 

granted to him, but no satisfactory 

reparation can  be  offered  to  an 

Crl. Misc. No.777-B-2019 

6 

innocent  man  for  his  unjustified 

incarceration at  any  stage  of  the 

case  albeit  his  acquittal  in  the 

ong run. 
"

15.  For 

the 

above 

reasons, 

instant 

petition 

is  allowed  and 

the  petitioner 

Is 

enlarged  on  bail  after  arrest,  subject 

to 

furnishing 

bail  bonds  m 

the 

sum  of 

Rs.1,00,000/-  with  one  surety  in  the  like 

amount  to  the  satisfaction  of  learned 

trial 

court. 

16. 

It  Is  clarified 

that  any  observation, 

made  hereinabove, 

IS 

tentative 

in  nature 

and  shall  not  prejudice 

learned 

trial  court 

during  the  trial.
