LUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ; J:  

Through 

instant 

petition, 

the 

petitioner  [Sadia  Arif]  has  assailed  judgment  dated  05.11.2019,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West-Islamabad  (hereinafter  referred  to 

as  the  Appellate  Court)  in  Appeal  No.  113/2019,  whereby  the  ex-parte 

judgment  dated  22.05.2019,  passed  by    the  Judge  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Family  Court)  was  partially 

modified.   

2. 

Facts  as  per  petition  are  that  the  Nikkah  of  the  petitioner  with 

Respondent No.1 was solemnized on 19.11.2016 on a dower of 5.7 tola gold 

ornaments and rukhsati took place on 03.02.2018. The marriage between the 

parties did not last long and allegedly the Petitioner was forcefully dropped 

at her parents’ house on 21.03.2018 by Respondent No.1. She thus filed suit 

against the Respondent No. 1 on 22.12.2018, for dissolution of marriage and 

recovery of dower & dowry articles, gold ornaments and for past and future 

maintenance,  before  the  Family  Court,  which  proceeded  ex-parte  against 

him  due  to  non-attendance  of  Respondent  No.1  and  passed  judgment  by 

recording  the  statement  of  the  Petitioner  appearing  as  the  only  plaintiff 

witness / PW-1. Vide judgment dated 22.05.2019, the Leaned Family Court 

decreed the suit to the extent of granting Khula subject to relinquishment of  

dower  and  directed  recovery  of  maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  3,000/-  per 

month  from  April  2018  till  the  period  of  iddat,  while  dismissing  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No. 350 of 2020

remaining  the  claims  in  the  suit.  The  Petitioner  filed  appeal  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  22.05.2019,  before  Learned  Appellate  Court 

which, vide judgment dated 05.11.2019, accepted the appeal to the extent of 

increasing the amount of maintenance from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs.5,000/- for the 

period determined by Learned Family Court, whereas, declined to allow the 

remaining  claims  in  the  suit.  The  petitioner  being  dissatisfied  challenged 

both the decisions dated 22.05.2019 and 05.11.2019 before this court in the 

instant writ petition. 

3. 

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that amount of dower was 

fixed at 5.7 tolas of gold to be given at the time of rukhsati which was paid 

to  the  Petitioner  but  after  the  rukhsati  all  the  gold  ornaments  were  taken 

back by Respondent No. 1 on the pretext of placing it in the safe locker  of 

the bank and never returned the same to the Petitioner thereafter; that after 

dissolution  of  marriage  by  way  of  Khula,  the  Respondent  No.  1  also 

pronounced  divorce,  vide  Divorce  Deed  dated  22.06.2019  on  the  basis  of 

which  the  divorce  effectiveness  certificate  was  issued  on  27.09.2019, 

therefore,  the  marriage  between  the  parties  has  been  dissolved  by  way  of 

divorce  and  not  by  way  of  Khula,  the  Petitioner,  therefore,  in  appeal 

requested to withdraw her suit to the extent of Khula; that appeal was turned 

down  by  the  Learned  Appellate  Court  for  the  reason  that  the  marriage 

between  the  parties  has  been  dissolved  by  the  court  on  22.05.2019  on  the 

basis  of  Khula,  therefore,  subsequent  pronouncement  of  divorce  through 

Divorce  Deed  dated  22.06.2019  has  no  legal  effect.  He  assailed  the 

judgment of the Learned Appellate Court, against the finding that no appeal 

lie against the decree of Khula under section 14(2)(a) of the West Pakistan 

Family Court Ordinance, 1964,  except for the reasons specified in  section 

2(d)(viii)  of  Dissolution  of  Muslim  Marriages  Act  1939.  Learned  counsel 

submitted that on the basis of wrong interpretation of the provision of law, 

the  Leaned  Appellate  Court  has  refused  permission  to  the  Petitioner  to 

withdraw  the  suit  to  the  extent  of  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of 

khula  and  submitted  that  subsequent  pronouncement  of  talaq  will  prevail 

over  the  decree  of  khula.  With  regard  to  the  claim  of  the  Petitioner  for 

maintenance  was  for  Rs.  30,000/-  per  month  and  dowry  articles  including 

gold  received  in  dowry,  learned  counsel  submitted  that  list  of  articles  and 

 
W.P. No. 350 of 2020 
Sadia Arif v. Adnan Shahid, etc

gold was appended with the suit, but the same have also been discarded on 

irrelevant grounds by the both the courts below. He relied on the judgments 

reported  as  Malik  Tahir  Ayub VSAdditional  District  Judge,  Rawalpindi 

(PLD 2015 Lah 57), Chanzeb VSMst. Yasmeen Bibi (2015 MLD 1140), 

Faiz  Noor VSDilawar  Hussain 

(1995  CLC 

1319),  Abid 

Hussain VSAdditional  District  Judge,  Alipur,  District  Muzaffargarh 

(2006 SCMR 100) and Naila Azmat VSJudge Family Court (1999 MLD 

3090).    

4. 

 On  the  other  hand,  learned  Counsel  for  Respondent  No.  1,  strongly 

contested the averments made on behalf of the petitioner and submitted that 

the  Petitioner  has  fraudulently  obtained  the  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree 

dated  22.05.2019  by  intentionally  mentioning  wrong  address  on  the  suit 

thus, notices have been issued by the court but received back un-served yet 

he  accepted  the  judgment  of  the  Learned  Family  Court  and  did  not  file 

appeal against it; that issues including the dissolution of marriage and return 

of dowry articles were amicably resolved between the parties through Jirga, 

however, the  Petitioner filed the suit for Khula and recovery of dower and 

dowry  articles  with  mala-fide  intentions;  that  since,  the  court  pronounced 

dissolution of  marriage by way of Khula thus, the  pronouncement of  talaq 

would not prevail over it; that the claim of gold is based on false accusation 

as the gold ornaments were never given to Respondent No.1; that she could 

not  prove  the  allegation  of  handing  over  of  gold  ornaments  to  Respondent 

No.1  on  wedding  night,  in  the  trial  proceedings  despite  the  fact  that  she 

managed to get the case decided ex-parte against Respondent No. 1; that all 

the dowry articles have already been returned to the Petitioner which has not 

been denied; that the list of dowry articles cannot be considered as the bridal 

gifts  as  the  list  of  dowry  article  attached  with  the  suit  describes  the  items 

given  to  the  relatives  and  Respondent  No.1  as  the  wedding  gifts.  He 

supported  the  concurrent  judgments  of  the  Courts  below  and  prayed  for 

dismissal of the petition.  

5. 

Arguments  of  the  parties  have  been  heard  and  the  record  has  been 

perused with the assistance of the learned counsel for the parties.

6. 

Petitioner due to domestic disputes and unhappy matimonial relations 

with  Respondent  No.  1  filed  family  suit  before  the  Trial  Court  for 

dissolution  of  marriage  by  way  of  Khula,  recovery  of  dower  &  dowry 

articles  and  maintenance  allowance.  Perusal  of  the  suit  filed  before  the 

Family Court revealed that she has claimed 5.7 tolas of gold ornaments from 

Respondent No. 1 on account of dower, however, perusal of Nikkah Nama / 

Ex-P/2, shows that the dower of 5.7 tolas of gold ornaments has been given 

to the petitioner in the shape of gold ornaments at the time of  Nikkah. Her 

claim that dower of 5.7 tolas gold ornaments and 7.5 tolas of precious gold 

ornaments given to her in dowry / jahaiz was taken by Respondent No.1 for 

putting in the bank locker due to security reason remained unsubstantiated. It 

is  pertinent  to  mention  that  the  Trial  Court  had  passed  ex-parte  judgment 

against Respondent No.1 and the petitioner was the only PW to present the 

evidence  which  was  un-rebutted  due  to  non-attendance  of  the  Respondent 

No.1,  but  she  was  unable  to  convince  the  learned  Trial  Court  with  any 

material  evidence  or  witness  to  justify  her  contention  during  trial 

proceedings,  as  such,  was  rejected  which  findings  were  upheld  by  the 

learned Appellate Court. In addition to the claim of dowry the petitioner had 

claimed maintenance at the rate of Rs.30,000/- per month from March, 2018, 

but failed to persuade the learned Trial Court that she was forcibly deserted 

by Respondent No.1 from his house. She was rather unable to establish the 

sound  financial  status  of  Respondent  No.  1  mandatory  for  deciding  the 

maintenance,  therefore,  the  learned  Trial  Court  found  her  entitled  for 

monthly maintenance of Rs. 3,000/- from April, 2018 till the period of iddat. 

However, the learned Appellate Court found the amount of Rs. 3,000/- to be 

meager and insufficient, therefore,  enhanced the amount to Rs. 5,000/-.  As 

regards the dowry articles, list of which was also attached with the record of 

the  petition  [page  41  of  the  petition  (Ex-P/3)]  appears  to  be  the  items 

purchased  for  Respondent  No.  1  as  wedding  gifts,  some  items  of  the 

petitioner’s personal use and the dresses for his family members, presented 

to  them  as  gifts.  Record  shows  that  the  petitioner  in  support  of  the  claim 

could not produce the receipts / proof of purchase of articles as per list Ex-

P/3. Moreover, during the arguments, learned counsel for the petitioner has 

admitted  the  fact  that  all  the  dowry  articles  of  personal  use  have  been 

returned back to the petitioner after the decision of Jirga. Thus, the learned 

 
W.P. No. 350 of 2020 
Sadia Arif v. Adnan Shahid, etc  

5 

Trial Court was justified in declining the petitioner’s claim of dowry articles 

which finding has been affirmed by learned Appellate Court, vide impugned 

judgment dated 05.11.2019.  

7.   Another issue which has been raised by the petitioner in this petition 

is in respect of findings of the learned Appellate Court, given in response to 

the submissions regarding withdrawing of her suit to the extent of Khula in 

view of the pronouncement of talaq through divorce deed dated 22.06.2019 

i.e. after the issuance of decree of Khula on 22.05.2019, which request was 

rejected in the following words:- 

“Perusal  of  record  shows  that  the  suit  of  the  appellant/plaintiff  for 
dissolution of marriage was decreed on the basis of Khula, vide impugned 
ex parte judgment and decree on 22.05.2019. After that pronouncement of 
divorce by the respondent / defendant vide divorce deed dated 22.06.2019 
was of  no legal effect.  Moreover, as per  provision of  section 14(2)(a) of 
West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 no appeal shall lie from a decree 
passed by a family court for dissolution of marriage,  except in the case of 
dissolution  for  reasons  specified  in  clause  (d)  of  items  (viii)  of  the 
Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939. Hence the appellant/plaintiff 
cannot  be  allowed  to  withdraw  her  suit  to  the  extent  of  dissolution  of 
marriage on the basis of Khula. However, if the dissolution of marriage is 
decreed subject to any conditions then an appeal lies only to the extent of 
conditions  but  not  against  the  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of 
khula itself.”. 

8. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  is  of  the  view  that  despite  the 

issuance of decree of khula dated 22.05.2019, the dissolution of marriage is 

to be  treated  through  divorce/talaq  pronounced  by  Respondent  No. 1,  vide 

divorce  deed  dated  22.06.2019.  He  also  referred  the  certificate  issued  by 

Chairman, Arbitration Council dated 25.09.2019, which was also issued on 

the basis of pronouncement of divorce by Respondent No. 1.  

9.  Muslim  Law  provides  for  dissolution  of  marriage  by  way  of  act  of 

parties  i.e.  husband  &  wife  themselves  or  by  a  decree  of  the  court  of  law. 

When  the parties  or anyone of them arrive  at  the decision that they cannot 

continue  to  live  together  within  the  limits  prescribed  by  Al-mighty  Allah 

then they may proceed to dissolve the contract of marriage. The husband has 

been granted the right to give talaq/divorce to his wife on his own initiative, 

by following the principles according to the Muslim Family Laws legislated 

on the basis of Quran and Sunnah and by paying the benefits and the amount 

of  dower/mehar  fixed  as  per  Nikkah  nama  at  the  time  of  Nikkah.  The 

Muslim Law also grants right to the wife to end the bond of marriage by way 

 
W.P. No. 350 of 2020 
Sadia Arif v. Adnan Shahid, etc  

6 

of “Khula” through court of law. This right is not dependent on the consent 

of husband. It is when she came to the conclusion that it is not possible for 

her  to  live  with  her  husband  and  observe  religious  obligation  of  marriage 

within the bounds  prescribed by  sharia  then  she  is permitted  to  invoke her 

right and seek dissolution of marriage through court of law by filing suit for 

decree of Khula. In such event the wife is required to return the benefits as 

well as the mehar/dower received in lieu of Nikkah, to the husband as held 

in the cases re: Syed Muhammad Ali VSMussarat Jabeen (2003 MLD 

1077  Karachi),  BIBI  Anwar  Khatoon VSGulab  Shah  (PLD  1988 

Karachi 602), Bibi Feroza VSAbdul Hadi (2014 CLC 60 Baluchistan) 

and Mst. Shagufta Jabeen VSJaved Iqbal (1988 MLD 1207 Karachi). 

10. 

In  the  present  case,  the  petitioner  has  invoked  her  right  for  seeking 

dissolution of marriage through a suit and obtained the decree of Khula on 

22.05.2019.  However,  the  Respondent  No.  1  pronounced  talaq-e-salasa 

through  divorce  deed  dated  22.06.2019.  The  petitioner  while  assailing  the 

judgment  of  Trial  Court  dated  22.05.2019,  to  agitate  dismissal  of  suit  for 

rejecting the claim of dower, maintenance & dowry Articles and also made a 

request to the Appellate Court to allow her to withdraw the suit to the extent 

of  claim  of  Khula.  As  per  record,  after  obtaining  the  decree  of  Khula  on 

22.05.2019,  petitioner  did  not  approach  the  concerned  Arbitration  Council 

for  issuance  of  divorce  effectiveness  certificate  which  has  been  issued  in 

response  to  application  filed  by  Respondent  No.1.  It  is  worth  mentioning 

that  dissolution  of  marriage  through  Khula  is  neither  revocable  nor 

appealable.  Whereas,  in  the  present  case  the  petitioner 

instead  of 

relinquishment of dower as a result of Khula  has sought withdrawal of her 

suit  only  to  the  extent  of  dissolution  of  marriage  through  Khula  on  the 

pretext  of  pronouncement  of  triple  talaq  by  Respondent  No.1.  I  am  of  the 

opinion that her  request has rightly been declined by the learned Appellate 

Court as per  findings reproduced in para 8 above  being  absurd and legally 

not  possible.  Reliance  in  this  regard  can  safely  be  placed  on  the  case  law 

reported  as  Shah  Hussain  VS Mst.  Nadia  Khan  and  others  (2018  YLR 

2663)  and  Bibi  Feroza  and  others  VS Abdul  Hadi  and  another  (2014 

CLC  60).  Even  otherwise,  when  proceedings  in  the  Trial  Court  has  been 

concluded and decree has been issued, then the question of withdrawal of the 

 
W.P. No. 350 of 2020 
Sadia Arif v. Adnan Shahid, etc  

7 

suit  does  not  arise.  Thus,  I  am  of  the  considered  opinion  that  once  the 

marriage  has  been  dissolved  at  the  instance  of  petitioner  /  wife,  by  the 

learned  Trial  Court  duly  granting  her  right  of  Khula  through  decree  dated 

22.05.2019, the subsequent pronouncement of talaq-e-salasa/triple talaq has 

no legal effect  and the concurrent findings of the learned Courts’ below in 

this regard are lawful and justified and does not call for any interference by 

this Court.                                                                                                                             

11.  For what has been discussed above, present writ petition, being devoid 

of any merit, is hereby dismissed.
