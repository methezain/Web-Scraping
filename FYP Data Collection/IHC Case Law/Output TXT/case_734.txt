S. No. of

Proceedings 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel 
where necessary.  

03.02.2022  Mr. Muhammad Islam Sandhu, Advocate for the petitioner.  

The petitioner, mother of the minor girl, questions the 

interim  order  dated  15.12.2021  whereby  the  learned  Judge 

Family-Guardian  Court  allowed  the  father  and  the  paternal 

grandmother to have  custody of the  minor from  10 AM  to 4 

PM on the first and third Sunday of each month and to return 

the minor to the mother’s house on the same day.  The father 

lives and works in Saudi Arabia.   

2 

The  petitioner’s  counsel  both  in  the  memo  of  petition 

and  during  arguments  has  advanced  vague  concerns  about 

strangers  living  in  the  house  with  the  grandmother  and  the 

safety of the minor, and that the grandmother has pain in the 

knee joints.  As for the latter objection, the grandmother is not 

expected  to  go  jogging  with  the  minor.    As  for  the  former 

objection,  it  is  not  credible  as  in  our  society  strangers  don’t 

live with families.  Further, the law imposes a duty of care on 

the  grandmother  to  ensure  the  safety  and  care  of  the  minor 

when with her.    

3 

I  find  no  illegality  or  impropriety  in  the  impugned 

order. 

  The 

law 

is  settled 

that  regular  contact  with 

grandparents  is  consistent  with  the  welfare  of  the  minor  and 

that  the  Court  premises  are  not  appropriate  places  for 

visitation rights (Mst. Fatima Ali and another VS Mst. Rubina 

Ehtesham and 4 others, 2018 Y L R 1891).

However, in order to address the apprehensions of the 

petitioner, the impugned order is supplemented to add that: 

i) 

the grandmother shall herself pick and drop the 

child  from  and  to  the  mother’s  house.    If  she 

can’t  do  so,  she  will  ensure  that  only  a  blood 

relative  authorised  by  the  grandmother  shall 

pick and drop the child.  When in Pakistan, the 

father will himself pick and drop the child; and 

ii) 

the grandmother/father shall not allow the child 

left unattended at any time nor left alone in the 

company  of  any  other  male  member  of  the 

household.  Any outdoor activities will be in the 

company 

and  under 

the 

sight  of 

the 

grandmother or the father when in Pakistan.

This petition is accordingly disposed of.
