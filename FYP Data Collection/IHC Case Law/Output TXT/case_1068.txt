petitioners.  

  Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioners,  Sidrah  Shoukat  and  her  daughter, 

impugn 

the 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.09.2021  passed  by  the  Court  of  the  learned 

Additional  District  Judge,  East-Islamabad 

whereby  the  petitionersâ€™  appeal  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  25.10.2019 passed 

by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court  East-

Islamabad was dismissed. 

  Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted 

that  the  learned  courts  below  concurrently 

erred  by  requiring  the  petitioners  to  return  the 

dower  amount  since  the  petitioner, 

in  her 

statement,  had  clearly  stated  that  she  was 

applied 

for  Khulla  on 

the  ground 

that 

respondent  No.3  used  to  beat  her  up;  that 

where  Khulla  is  granted  on  the  ground  of 

cruelty the wife is under no obligation to return 

the dower.  

Learned counsel is directed to file a copy of a 

Nikkah Nama prior to the next date of hearing.  

Issue notice to the respondents.  

  Relist.
