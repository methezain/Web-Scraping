Proceedings
03.10.2019. Mr. Muhammad Shahid Iqbal, Advocate

for the petitioner.
Mr. Muhammad Jahangir  Khan, Advocate
for the resPondents.

Through the  instant  Petition, the
petitioner  has challenged  judgment dated

2O.LO.2OL7 passed by respondent No.2 as
well as 0L.02.20t7  passed by respondent

No.3.
2.  The facts, in brief, are that petitioner
No.1 and the respondent  got married on

11.04.1999.  Out of the wedlock  four children

were born. Differences  arose between  the

spouses,  which culminated into divorce on

02.L1.2013.  Respondent No.1 filed a petition

under Section  25 of Guardian  and Wards Act,

1890, which was decided on L4.04.2015. The

Constitutional petition was filed i.e. CP No.
1686/2015 in  this Court assailing the

judgments  dated t4.04.2015  and 14.05.2015
which was allowed and the matter was

remanded  to the Guardian  Court for decision
on  the  question of  jurisdiction.  On

W.P  No.4l68  of 2017

a

0t.02.20L7, respondent No.3 decided the

matter  on merit after deciding the question  of

jurisdiction  on 2L.06.2017.  On 27.03.20L7 an

appeal was filed which was dismissed  on

20.t0.20L7  as being barred by limitation,

hence the petition.
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter
alia, contended that since the order in
question is not sustainable,  hence be set

aside. It was submitted that the delay, if any,

was required to be condoned.
4.  Learned counsel for respondent  No.1,

inter alia, contended that the appeal preferred

was barred by limitation, hence was rightly

dismissed.
5.  Arguments  heard,  record perused.
6.  As noted above, the learned trial Court
decided the application  under Section  25 of

Guardian  and Wards Act, 1890 on 01 .02.20L7.

The appellants applied for certified copy of the

said order on 27.03.20L7  and filed it on the

same day. The !imitation  period provides for

filing of an appeal  to District Judge from the

decision of the Guardian  Court is 30 days,

hence the appeal was barred by limitation.

Even findings have been rendered on merit,

which stipulate that the petitioner did not lead

any evidence  in the rebuttal to the evidence  of

respondent No.1.

7.  In view of above position, the impugned

order does not suffer from any error of law or

jurisdiction.

8.  For what has been discussed above,  the
instant petition is without  merit and is

accordingly  dismissed.
