WRIT PETITION NO.438 OF 2020 

Malik Musawar Khan 
VS    
Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others  

Petitioner by       : 

Mr. Ghulam Muhammad Khan, Advocate. 

Respondents by  : 

Raja Ahmed Abdul Rafay, Advocate. 
(For Respondent Nos. 1 to 3) 

Date of hearing     : 

05.01.2022. 

SAMAN  RAFAT  IMTIAZ,  J.      Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

Petitioner  (Malik  Musawar  Khan)  assailed  Judgment  and  Decree  dated 

21.12.2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West), 

Islamabad,  whereby  the  appeal  filed  by  Respondents  No.  1  to  3  was 

partially  allowed  and  consequently  the  Judgment  and  Decree  dated 

26.06.2019,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Family  Court 

(West), Islamabad, was modified.  

2. 

The  record  shows  that  marriage  between  the  Petitioner  and 

Respondent No.1 was solemnized on 09.02.2013. The dowry amount was 

fixed at 04 tola gold and Rs.100,000/- out of which 02 tola  gold was given 

at  the  time  of  marriage  whereas  02  tola  gold  and  Rs.100,000/-  was 

deferred.  The couple was blessed with a son, i.e. Respondent No.2 and a 

daughter, i.e. Respondent No.3.  

3. 

On  24.01.2019,  Respondents  No.1  to  3  instituted  a  suit  for 

dissolution  of  marriage,  recovery  of  dower  and  maintenance  against  the 

Petitioner.  It  was,  inter-alia,  contended  in  the  said  suit  that  the  Petitioner 

treated  the  Respondent  No.  1  with  cruelty  and  ultimately  on  08-09-2015, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  2 

the  Petitioner  ousted  the  Respondents  No.  1  to  3  from  his  house,  where 

after  she  has  been  bearing  all  expenditure  herself  with  the  help  of  her 

brother and no maintenance has been paid by the Petitioner. The Petitioner 

filed  contesting  Written  Statement  in  which  he  prayed  for  restitution  of 

conjugal rights.  

4. 

The  suit  was  partially  decreed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

vide Judgment and Decree dated 26.06.2019, in the following terms: 

The plaintiff No.1 shall be entitled to  maintenance allowance of 
“I. 
Rs.5,000/-  per  month  from  date  of  institution  of  suit  till  subsistence  of 
marriage. 

The  plaintiffs  No.  2  &  3  shall  be  entitled  to  maintenance 
II. 
allowance  of  Rs.5,000/-  per  month  for  each  from  date  of  institution  of 
suit till age of majority of plaintiff No.2 and marriage of plaintiff No.3. 
The  maintenance  allowance  of  minors  shall  be  subject  to  10%  annual 
increase.  

III. 
The  plaintiff  No.1  is  entitled  for  recovery  of  two  tolas  gold  and 
Rs.1,00,000/-  as  dower.  So  far,  her  claim  regarding  snatching  of  two 
tolas gold given at the time of marriage is concerned the same could not 
be proved, hence declined to that extent.  

The  decree  for  restitution  of  conjugal  rights  is  passed  in  favor  of 
defendant.  The suit of the Plaintiff No. 1 for dissolution of marriage on 
the  basis  of  cruelty  and  non-maintenance  is  dismissed.  No  order  as  to 
cost.” 

5. 

Feeling aggrieved by the said Judgment and Decree, the Respondents 

No. 1 to 3 preferred an appeal before the learned Additional District Judge 

(West),  Islamabad.  The  learned  Appellate  Court,  vide  Judgment  and 

Decree  dated  21.12.2019  (“Impugned  Judgment”)  partially  accepted  the 

appeal  and  modified  the  learned  Family  Court’s  Judgment  and  Decree 

dated 26.06.2019, in the following terms: 

1.  The plaintiff No.1 shall be entitled to  maintenance allowance of 
Rs.5000/-  per  month  from  the  date  of  institution  of  suit  till  the 
period of Idat. 

2.  The  plaintiff  No.2  and  3  shall  be  entitled  to  maintenance 
allowance  @  Rs.8000/-  each  per  month  with  10%  per  anum 
increase till the majority of appellant No.2 and till the marriage 
of appellant No.3.  

3.  Judgment  and  decree  in  favour  of  respondent  to  the  extent  of 
restitution  of  conjugal  rights  is  hereby  set  aside  and  suit  of  the 

 
 
 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  3 

appellant No.1 is hereby decreed for dissolution  of marriage on 
the basis of Khulaa instead of on the basis of cruelty etc. 

4.  The appellant No.1 is also entitled to recovery of 2 tolas gold and 

Rs.100,000/- as dower. 

6. 

The  Petitioner  aggrieved  of  the  Judgment  and  Decree  dated 

21.12.2019  filed instant  Writ  Petition.    Arguments  advanced on  behalf of 

learned counsel for the parties have been heard and the documents placed 

on record have been examined with their able assistance.  

7. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  there  are  no 

irreconcilable  differences  or  dispute  between  the  Petitioner  and  the 

Respondent No.1  inter se  and that  it was the brother of Respondent No.1 

namely  Imran,  who  was  also  Respondent  No.  1’s  attorney  who  did  not 

want  the  parties  to  reconcile  due  to  mala  fide  intentions  and  ulterior 

motives.    In  view  of  the  foregoing,  the  legal  counsel  for  the  Petitioner 

requested  that  the  Respondent  No. 1  may be  directed to  appear  in person 

before this Court.  The learned counsel for the Petitioner has cited  Gulzar 

Hussain  VS  Mst.  Mariyam  Naz,  2000  MLD  447;    Muhammad  Ayub 

Khan  VS  Mst.  Shehla  Rasheed  and  another,  PLD  2010  Karachi  131; 

Atiq Ahmed Khan VS Noor Ul Saba and another, 2011 CLC 1211; and 

Major Qamar Zaman Qadir VS Judge Family Court, Jehlum and others, 

PLD 2013 Lahore 88, whereby it was held that pronouncement of khula by 

the  Court  would  constitute  a  single  divorce  and  the  husband  and  wife  

would  be  at  liberty  to  remarry  each  other  after  solemnization  of  Nikah 

without intervening marriage.   

8. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the Respondents No. 1 to 

3 argued that Khula is neither revocable nor appealable in reliance upon the 

cases of Shahbaz VS Fakhira Bibi, 2021 MLD 1506; Shah Hussain VS 

Mst.  Nadia  Khan,  2018  YLR  2663;  Allahuddin  Khan  VS  Zamarud

others, 1984 CLC 1688; Muhammad Hanif VS Mst. Naseem Bibi, 1988

Feroza  VS  Abdul  Hadi,  2014  CLC  60;  Sadia  Arif  VS  Adnan  Shahid, 

2021  YLR  1753;  Mst.  Nabila  Safdar  VS  Muneer  Anwar,  2000  SD  560; 

Jaffar Ali VS Deputy Commissioner, etc., 2002 SD 819; Ana Liaqat VS 

Additional District Judge, Gujranwala, PLD 2021 Lahore 757; and Fazli-

e-Subhan VS Mst. Sabereen, PLD 2003 Peshawar 169.  

9. 

Insofar as the Petitioner’s request is concerned that the Respondent 

No.1 may be directed to appear in person before this Court, it is observed 

that the same will not serve any fruitful purpose as it is settled law that a 

decree of dissolution of marriage by way of Khula is neither revocable nor 

appealable. Having said that there is no cavil to the contention that a decree 

of  Khula  constitutes  one  divorce  and  as  such  the  Petitioner  and  the 

Respondent No.1 are at liberty to remarry each other by performing Nikah 

if  they  wish  to  reunite.  However,  the  parties  do  not  require  any 

pronouncement  from  this  Court  for  the  said  purpose  nor  can  this  Court 

direct the parties to do so.   

10.  This  brings  us  to  the  Petitioner’s  contention  that  the  Impugned 

Judgment & Decree is liable to be set aside regarding payment of dower to 

the Respondent No.1  because when suit for  Khula is decreed, the amount 

already paid by the husband to the wife is to be returned to the husband and 

anything outstanding is to be forfeited. In making his submissions, learned 

counsel for the Petitioner placed reliance on the judgments reported as Mt. 

Saima Irum and 3 others VS Tariq Javaid and another, 2006 MLD 83; 

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  5 

Muhammad  Khalil  VS  Shazia  Iqbal  and  2  others,  2006  CLC  1033; 

Muhammad Hassan VS Federation of Pakistan and 2 others, PLD 2018 

Federal Shariat Court 1; and Sadia Arif  VS Adnan Shahid and 2 others, 

2021 YLR 1753.  

11.  The learned counsel for the Respondents No.1 to 3 on the other hand, 

contended that Respondent No.1 did not file suit for dissolution of marriage 

by  way  of  Khula.  Instead  she  had  sought  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the 

grounds of cruelty, non-payment of maintenance, and non-performance of 

matrimonial  obligations.  In  this  regard,  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Respondents  No.1  to  3  relied  upon  the  cases  of  Mst.  Sabia  Naz  VS  Mir 

Rustam,  1999  SD  107;  Mst.  Saffiya  Bibi  VS  Fazal  Din,  2000  SD  684; 

Mst. Zatoon VS Sabir Hussain, 2002 SD  745; Syed Muhammad Ali VS 

Mussarat  Jabeen,  2003  MLD  1077;  and  Mst.  Khurshid  Bibi  VS  Baboo 

Muhammad Amin, PLD 1967 Supreme Court 97. 

12.  The  principle  that  emerges  from  the  citations  relied  upon  by  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  Respondents  No.  1  to  3  and  also  the  ones  relied 

upon  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  as  enumerated  in  the 

preceding two paragraphs is that  a decree for Khula may be granted even 

where no ground for dissolution of marriage as alleged by the wife exists 

and  the  wife  has  omitted  to  demand  Khula  if  the  Court  is  of  the  opinion 

that  in  the  event  that  decree  for  dissolution  of  marriage  is  not  granted,  it 

will give birth to a hateful union and the spouses may not be able to live 

with each other within the limits prescribed by God.  

13. 

In the instant case, the Respondent No.1 had stated in her Plaint that 

she  had  faced  such  agony  at  the  hands  of  the  Petitioner  that  it  was  not 

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  6 

possible for her to live with him while abiding by the limits of Allah. It is 

also  an  admitted  fact  that  the  parties  have  been  living  separately  since 

September,  2015.  The  pre-trial  reconciliation  proceedings  could  not 

succeed in the learned Family Judge’s own opinion. The foregoing factors 

were sufficient grounds for the grant of a decree for dissolution of marriage 

by  way  of  Khula  in  order  to  avoid  a  hateful  union  even  if  the  grounds 

alleged  by  the  Respondent  No.1  for  dissolution  of  marriage  were  not 

proved  through  evidence  in  the  opinion  of  the  Family  Court.  Instead  the 

learned Family Court concluded that it had not observed any material issue 

between  the  parties  on  the  basis  of  which  it  could  be  adjudged  that  the 

parties cannot live within the limits prescribed by Allah. Such a conclusion 

is beyond the jurisdiction of the learned Family Court. The learned Family 

Court,  therefore,  erred  by  dismissing  the  Respondent  No.1’s  suit  for 

dissolution  of  marriage  and  by  allowing  the  Petitioner’s  prayer  for 

restitution of conjugal rights as no woman can be forced to live with a man 

without her consent or liking.  

14.  Be  that  as it  may,  it  appears  from  the  Impugned  Judgment that  the 

learned Appellate Court summoned both the parties once again and heard 

them both at length but the Respondent No.1 stated that she was not ready 

to  live  with  the  Petitioner.  In  such  circumstances,  the  learned  Appellate 

Court rightly modified the Judgment and Decree dated 26.06.2019, passed 

by  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Family  Court  to  the  extent  that 

marriage  was  dissolved  on  the  basis  of  Khula  rather  than  cruelty  and  the 

judgment and decree in favor of the Petitioner to the extent of restitution of 

conjugal rights was set aside, which is in consonance with past precedent.  

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  7 

15.  But  the  question  that  arises  is  whether  in  such  circumstances  the 

learned  Appellate  Court  was  justified  in  allowing  the  Respondent  No.  1 

recovery  of  dower.  Khula  is  a  right  given  to  a  woman  as  the  right  to 

divorce is vested in a man with the difference that  Khula can be obtained 

only  through  a  decree  of  Court  and  on  payment  of  such  consideration  as 

may be fixed by Court.  

16.  The  Court  in  the  case  of  Attiq  Ahmed  Khan  (Supra)  explained  that 

the  principle  of  Khula  as  laid  down  in  various  eminent  commentaries  on 

Muslim Law in light  of the  Holy Quran and Sunnah is  that a woman can 

release  herself  from  the  tie  of  marriage  by  giving  up  some  property  in 

return in consideration of which the husband is to give her Khula.  Hence, 

Khula  is  repudiation  with  the  consent  and  at  the  instance  of  the  wife  in 

which she agrees to give consideration to the husband for her release from 

the marital tie. However, the Court cannot on its own deprive a lady of her 

dower and cannot order her to relinquish the same because the dower is the 

right of the woman given by Shariah as laid down by the Court in the case 

of Ana Liaquat (supra).   

17.  Moreover, the  learned  counsel  for  the Respondent No.1 has  argued 

that payment of consideration is not necessary in all cases of  Khula.  The 

Court  can  dissolve  a  marriage  on  the  basis  of  Khula  even  without  any 

compensation when it finds that Khula is being claimed due to fault on the 

part  of  the  husband.  He  has  relied  upon  the  case  of  Aurangzeb  VS  Mst. 

Gulnaz  PLD 2006 Karachi 563;  Khalid Mahmood VS Anees Bibi, PLD 

2007  Lahore  626;  Fozia  Begum  VS  Tariq  Hussain,  2004  SD  721; 

Tuharat  Firdos  VS  Imtiaz  Khan  and  others,  2019  CLC  1562;  and  Asif 

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  8 

Jahangir  VS  Mst.  Zaheen  Kausar  and  others,  2015  YLR  1547    in  this 

regard.  

18.  The  logic  offered  by  the  cases  of  Saima  Irum  (Supra)  and  Ana 

Liaquat  (Supra)  is  that  otherwise  a  husband  could  refuse  to  give  ‘Talaq’ 

but at the same time create an environment causing the wife to seek Khula, 

which would entitle him to the benefit of retaining [deferred dower] and /or 

getting back [prompt] dower property/amount.  Thus it was held that where 

the  Court  through  legal,  cogent  and  convincing  evidence  comes  to  the 

conclusion that the husband has compelled the wife to ask for dissolution 

of marriage on the ground of Khula then the Court shall have the power to 

refuse the return of the [prompt] dowered property/amount to husband or to 

release him from the liability of payment of [deferred] dower.  

19.  Apart from the judgments cited by the learned counsel of the parties 

as mentioned herein above, we have also taken guidance from the case of 

Razia  Begum  VS  Saghir  Al-Imad,  1982  CLC  1586,  wherein  it  was  held 

that  it  was  not  correct  that  in  case  of  Khula,  the  wife  ipso  facto  should 

return  the  benefits.    The  Court  held  that  if  a  wife  seeks  Khula  without 

pointing  any  fault  of  the  husband  and  the  Court  finds  it  proper  to  grant 

Khula then the wife should be ordered to return all the benefits received by 

her  and  also  forego  such  rights  under  which  she  can  claim  any  benefit.  

However, on the facts of the case, the Court upheld the decision of the trial 

court  whereby  the  wife  was  allowed  recovery  of  deferred  dower.    The 

Court  very  clearly  stated  that  the  fact  that  dower  was  deferred  does  not 

mean  that  it  cannot  be  considered  while  granting  Khula  and  that  it  is 

obligatory  on  Courts  granting  Khula  to  take  into  consideration  dower 

regardless of whether it is prompt or deferred.  

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  9 

20. 

It is reiterated that in the case at hand, the Respondent No.1 did not 

pray for Khula nor did she make any statement regarding relinquishment of 

dower.  The Respondent No.1 prayed for dissolution of marriage on three 

grounds including the ground of non-maintenance for a period of more than 

two  years.  The  Respondent  No.1  alleged  that  she  was  ousted  by  the 

Petitioner  from  his  house  on  08-09-2015  and  that  the  Petitioner  has  not 

paid any maintenance at all to the Respondents since September, 2015.  On 

a factual appraisal, the learned Family Court  decided that the Respondent 

No.1  could  not  prove  desertion  by  the  Petitioner  on  08-09-2015.  

Regarding non-maintenance, the learned Family Court took note of the fact 

that  while  the  Petitioner  claimed  that  he  had  been  supporting  the 

Respondents  till  January,  2019,  he  could  not  bring  on  record  any  proof 

regarding provision of maintenance since the date of institution of the suit 

i.e.,  January,  2019  and  further  admitted  that  he  was  unaware  of  which 

school  his  children  were  studying  in.  However,  the  learned  Family  Court 

decided that the Respondent No. 1 was not entitled to decree of dissolution 

of  marriage  on  account  of  non-maintenance  as  such  remedy  is  available 

only where non-maintenance is for two years.  

21.  This appears to be a serious case of non-reading and misreading of 

evidence,  which  has  resulted  in  miscarriage  of  justice  as  the  Petitioner 

failed to produce any evidence of payment of maintenance since 2015 and 

not  just  since  date  of  institution  of  suit.  In  fact,  no  proof  of  maintenance 

was produced by the Petitioner in evidence at all.  Had the learned Family 

Court  appraised  the  evidence  correctly,  the  Respondent  No.1  would 

perhaps be found entitled to a decree for dissolution of marriage on account 

of non-maintenance for more than two years.   

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  10 

22.  Having  said  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  consider  the  validity  of  the 

Family  Court’s  decision  in  this  regard  given  that  the  learned  Appellate 

Court  has  already  dissolved  the  marriage  by  way  of  Khula  and  that  the 

Respondent No.1 has not challenged the same before this Court. The above 

discussion  is  nevertheless  relevant  as  failure  to  maintain  the  Respondents 

even if for less than the statutory period which entitles a wife to a  decree 

for dissolution of marriage under Section 2(ii) of the Dissolution of Muslim 

Marriages  Act,  1939  would  at  the  very  least  show  that  the  Respondent  

No. 1 approached the Court for dissolution of marriage on account of fault 

of  the  Petitioner,  in  which  case,  the  wife  is  entitled  to  recovery  of 

outstanding  dower.    Therefore,  I  find  no  reason  for  interference  in  the 

Impugned Judgment & Decree as far as the grant of dower is concerned. 

23.  Lastly,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the 

Petitioner’s monthly salary is Rs. 15,000/- and as such the enhancement in 

the amount of maintenance allowance made by the learned Appellate Court 

in  absence  of  any  proof  of  Petitioner’s  income  submitted  by  the 

Respondent No. 1 is against the settled principles of justice as laid down by 

superior  courts,  reliance  was  placed  on  case  titled  Khalid  Mahmood  VS 

Naseem  Akhtar reported as 2019  MLD 820.  The  learned counsel  for the 

Respondent  No.  1  has  drawn  our  attention  to  the  Petitioner’s  cross-

examination 

in  which  he  has  admitted  purchase  of  property 

in 

consideration  of  Rs.  2,700,000/-  out  of  which  Rs.  2,200,000/-  have 

admittedly been paid by the Petitioner already.    

24. 

It  is  also  noted  that  according  to  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Respondents  No.  1  to  3,  the  Petitioner  has  not  paid  any  amount  toward 

maintenance  despite  orders  of  the  lower  courts,  which  has  not  been 

 
Malik Musawar Khan VS Mst. Nadia Yaseen Malik and others 

W.P. No.438/2020  11 

controverted  by 

the 

learned  counsel  for 

the  Petitioner.  In  such 

circumstances where the Petitioner has been unable to provide any proof of 

paying maintenance allowance to Respondents No. 2 & 3 since September, 

2015  and  has  also  failed  to  pay  any  maintenance  amount,  whatsoever,  to 

the minor Respondents despite court orders, I  am not inclined to set aside 

the  Impugned  Judgment  &  Decree  in  respect  of  the  enhancement  of 

maintenance allowance of Respondents No. 2 & 3. 

25.  For  all  the  foregoing  reasons,  I  uphold  the  Judgment  and  Decree 

dated 21.12.2019, passed by the learned Additional District Judge (West), 

Islamabad.  This Petition, having no force, is hereby dismissed.
