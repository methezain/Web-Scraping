Jahanzeb Shah

VS

The Senior Civil Judge/Executing Judge (West), Islamabad, etc.

Petitioner:

In Person.

Respondents by:

Mr. Mushtaq  Hussain and  Mr.  Afzaal  Qadeer
Satti, Advocates.

Date of Decision:

10.01.2022.

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J: Through  this  Writ  Petition,  the

petitioner has prayed for the following relief:-

That  the  order  dated  01.10.2020  be  clarified  and  the  petitioner/father  be

granted  visitation  rights  with  his  minor  sons  according  to  the  schedule

fixed  by  learned  trial  court  (vide  order  dated  29.09.2018)  and  learned

ADJ(W)  (vide  order  11.04.2019).  Any  other  relief  that  IHC  deems

beneficial for welfare of the minors may also be granted.

2.

Petitioner  in  person  states  that  respondent  No.3  and  petitioner  were

married  but  later  on  due  to  acute  disparity  respondent  No.3 filed  suit  for

dissolution of marriage and got decree of Khulla on 11.12.2012 from the Family

court,  Islamabad;  that  during  the  subsistence  of  marriage  respondent  No.4

namely Muhammad  Waleed  Shah  alias  Abdul  Samad and  respondent  No.5

namely Muhammad  Adeen Shah  alias  Muhammad  Musa were born  on

28.01.2007  and 27.04.2011 respectively;  that  he  filed  petition  U/S  25  of  the

Guardian  &  Wards  Act  for  the  custody  of  the  minors,  which  was  allowed  vide

judgment & decree dated 29.09.2018, passed by learned Guardian Judge (West),

Islamabad  with  a  specific  visitation  schedule  referred  in  para-2,  however,  the

W.P. No.4240/2021

2

judgment  was  set-aside  in  appeal  and  reversed  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated

11.04.2019,  passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge-VII  (West),  Islamabad

while maintaining para-32 of Family Court judgment with the visitation right in

favour  of  petitioner  instead  of  respondent  No.3;  that  he  filed  writ  petition

No.1814/2019  against  the  said  judgment  of  the  appellate  court  and  same  was

also  dismissed  by  this  court  vide  order  dated  01.10.2021,  however,  during  the

pendency  of  writ  petition  this  court  has  passed  interim  order  dated  09.01.2020

with the consent of the parties to regulate the visitation of the minors and as such

the  Executing  Court  has  now  applied 

the  said 

interlocutory  order

notwithstanding the judgment & decree passed in favour of the  petitioner; that

order passed by the Executing Court is contrary to the judgment & decree of the

appellate  court,  therefore,  direction  be  issued  for  strict  compliance  of  visitation

schedule as order by the appellate court.

3.

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.3  to  5  has  raised  the

question of maintainability of instant writ petition primarily on the ground that

petitioner  has  initially  filed  appeal  before  learned  Additional  District  Judge

(West),  Islamabad  but  the  same  was  withdrawn  vide  order  dated  12.10.2021

without  any 

justification  and  filed 

instant  writ  petition,  which 

is  not

maintainable;  that  parties  have  also  amicably  resolved  the  dispute  through

consenting  statement  recorded  on  11.09.2021  as  a  result  whereof  execution

proceedings stands withdrawn, therefore, instant writ petition is not competent.

4.

5.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that petitioner/father of  respondents  No.4  & 5

was  granted  visitation  right  by  the  first  appellate  court  vide  para-14  of  the

judgment & decree dated 11.04.2019 in the following manner:-

However, since Jahanzeb is father and natural guardian of the two minors,

therefore,  he  has  the  visitation  rights as  to frequency  of  the  visitation

rights, I see that the visitation rights granted by the learned Family Court

W.P. No.4240/2021

3

in  Para-32  of  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  may  be  applied  on

Jahanzeb  instead  of  Saba.  All  pending  applications  in  the  appeal,  if  any,

have become infructuous. File be consigned to record after completion and

compilation.

6.

The above referred order clearly reflects that visitation schedule was fixed

by the Judge Family Court in Para-32, which has now been considered in favour

of petitioner/father, which is as under:-

a. The  respondent/mother  shall  have  the  right  to  meet  the  minors  on

every Saturday and the minors will be handed over to the respondent

for the period of one day from Saturday morning 10:00 AM till 5:00

PM Saturday Evening. It will be the responsibility of the respondent

to  pick  the  minors  from  the  house  of  the  petitioner  on  the  Saturday

morning  10:00  a.m.  to  5:00  p.m.  Saturday  evening  and  drop  them

back at the house of the petitioner.

b.

In addition to weekly visitation schedule, respondent/mother has also

been  allowed  visitation  rights  on  specific  events  to  the  effect  that

respondent/mother  shall  have  the  right  to  meet  with  the  minors  on

second day of Eid-ul-Fitar and Eid-ul-Azha, from morning to evening

at the house of respondent/mother.

c. Moreover,  during  visitation,  the  respondent/mother  shall  not  remove

the minor beyond territorial limits of Islamabad. Petitioner/father shall

be  bound  to  intimate  the  court  regarding  any  change  in  her  address;

otherwise  it  shall  be  deemed  as  an  act  contrary  to  the  welfare  of  the

minor.  All  the  meeting  will  be  subject  to  furnishing  surety  bond  of

Rs.500,000/- for safe return of minors.

7.

The petitioner/father despite this order filed writ petition No.1814/2019,

which  was  dismissed  by  this  court.  However,  during  the  pendency  of  matter

before  this  court  interim  visitation  schedule  was  agreed  between parties  vide

order dated 09.01.2021 in which petitioner have to meet the minors on 2nd and 4th

weekend  of  the month  for  two  hours  in  visitation  room  of  learned  Guardian

Court  but  after  dismissal  of  writ  petition  the  original  order  restored.  However,

learned Executing Court has not implemented the judgment & decree passed in

W.P. No.4240/2021

4

favour  of  the  petitioner  rather  interpreted  the  interlocutory  order  dated

09.01.2021 as final order against the spirit of decree, whereby complete schedule

has  been  announced  in  Para-32  of  the  trial  court  judgment  which  has  been

converted in favour of petitioner by the appellate court.

8.

Besides  this  clarification  another  astonishing  factor  comes  into  lime  light

that  on  11.09.2021  both  the  parties  stated  before  the  court  that  compromise has

been effected between them on the issue of visitation and maintenance of minors,

where-after conclusive order was passed by learned Sr. Civil Judge, Islamabad as

a  result  whereof  execution  proceedings  stood disposed  of.  However,  at  this

stage, petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this court and he has not referred

as to why he has withdrawn the appeal without any lawful justification against

the order  of executing  court  dated  21.01.2021,  which  is  impugned  before  this

court.  In  such  scenario,  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable  but  cumulative  effect

reveals that the petitioner and respondent No.3 agreed as per schedule referred

in Para-32 of the order of trial court, which was converted in appeal in favour of

petitioner.  In  such  eventuality  instant  writ  petition  stands disposed  of with

observation 

that  petitioner 

shall  approach 

the  Guardian  Court 

for

implementation  of  visitation  schedule  in  line  with  joint  statement  dated

11.09.2021, recorded by the Executing Court as referred above and may visit the

minors as per agreed schedule mentioned in Para-32 of the trial court judgment.
