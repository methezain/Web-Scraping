At  the  very  outset,  learned  counsel  for 

respondents  has  stated  that  the  petitioner 

has  not  even  paid  interim  maintenance  since 

October,  2019  and  now  on  the  pretext  of 

suspension  of  judgment  of  appellate  Court 

dated  19.11.2020,  is  avoiding  payment  of 

maintenance. He submitted that the minor is 

dependent  on  the  maintenance,  and  request 

for  directions 

for  payment  of 

interim 

maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned  trial  court, 

till  the  decision  of  the  instant  petition.

to  pay 

the 

outstanding  amount  of  interim  maintenance 

and  tried  to  pay  some  amount  before  this 

Court,  which  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents  has  refused  on  the  ground  that 

the  maintenance  is  due  since  October,  2019 

and  without  instruction  of  her  client,  he  will 

not accept the same in piecemeal.   

2. 

The  learned  counsel  is  directed  to 

calculate  the  amount  of  interim  maintenance 

as  fixed  by  the  learned  trail  court,  with  the 

coordination  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents, from the month he has stopped 

payment.  He  is  further  directed  to  pay  the 

interim  maintenance  regularly  without  any 

default.

Court  seek  time  to  resolve  the  dispute  of 

payment  of  interim  maintenance  and  sought
