Date of  order/ 
Proceedings 
15.06.2021  Mr. Safdar Ali Bhatti, Advocate for the petitioner. 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner,  Asim  Qayyum,  impugns  the  judgment 

and decree dated 18.03.2021 passed by the Court 

of 

the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad  whereby  his  appeal  against 

the 

judgment and decree dated 20.09.2020 passed by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad,  was 

partly  allowed  and  the said  judgment  and  decree, 

was  modified.  Vide  the  said  judgment  and  decree 

dated  20.09.2020, 

the  suit 

for  recovery  of 

maintenance  filed  by  respondents  No.1  to  3  was 

decreed by the learned Judge Family Court.  

2. 

Respondent  No.1  is  the  petitioner’s  wife 

whereas 

respondent  No.2 

is  his  son  and 

respondent  No.3  is  his  daughter.  Learned  Family 

Court  had 

fixed  maintenance  amounting 

to 

Rs.12,000/-  per  month  for  respondent  No.1  from 

the date of the institution of the suit with an annual 

increase  of  6%.  Furthermore,  maintenance 

amounting to Rs.12,000/- per month was also fixed 

for  each  of the  petitioner’s  children from  the date 

of the institution of the suit with an annual increase 

of  10%.  The  learned  Appellate  Court  modified  the 

said 

judgment 

and  decree  by 

reducing 

maintenance  of  respondent  No.1  and  for  each  of 

the  petitioner’s  children  to  Rs.8,000/-  per  month 

with  an  annual 

increase  of  6%.  The  past 

maintenance  to  which  the  learned  Family  Court 

 
                
 
 
  
 
 
2 

 W.P.No.2076/2021 

had  held  respondents  No.1  to  3  entitled  to  was 

also reduced.  

3. 

The only argument advanced by the learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  was  that  since  the 

petitioner  had  divorced  respondent  No.1,  on 

17.11.2020, he could not have been burdened with 

paying  maintenance  to  respondent  No.1  beyond 

the  expiry  of  the  iddat  period.  Learned  counsel 

further  submitted  that  the  reason  why  the  factum 

of  the  divorce  was  not  pleaded  in  his  appeal  was 

because  the  divorce  had  taken  place  after  the 

appeal was filed. There is nothing on the record to 

show that the petitioner had brought to the notice 

of the learned Appellate Court the fact that he had 

divorced respondent No.1 on 17.11.2020.  

4. 

The  petitioner  cannot  escape  his  obligation 

to  pay  maintenance to  respondent  No.1 by  simply 

producing  a  copy  of 

the  talaqnama  dated 

17.11.2020.  How  a  talaq  becomes  effective  has 

been  explained  in  the  judgment  reported  as 1986 

SCMR 1350.  A  person  having  pronounced  talaq 

was  required  to  give  the  Chairman,  Arbitration 

Council a written notice of him having done so and 

would  supply  a  copy  thereof  to  his  wife.  Such 

notice  of  talaq 

to  a  wife 

is  a  mandatory 

requirement  of  the 

law.  A  divorce  becomes 

effective  after  the  expiry  of  90  days  from  the 

receipt  of  notice  by  the  Chairman,  Arbitration 

Council  in  terms  of  Section  7(3)  and  (5)  of  the 

Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961.  There  is 

nothing  on  the  record  to  show  that  the  petitioner 

had  sent  any  notice  to  the  Chairman,  Arbitration 

Council. Therefore, the petitioner remains under a 

continuing  obligation  to  pay  maintenance  to  his 

wife.  

5. 

As  regards  the  quantum  of  maintenance 

fixed  by 

the 

learned  Appellate  Court 

for 

 
                                               
 
3 

 W.P.No.2076/2021 

respondents  No.1  to  3,  given  the  inflation  at  this 

day  and  age,  I  am  of  the  view  that  it  is  too  low. 

However,  since  respondents  No.1  to  3  have  not 

challenged  the  appellate  judgment  and  decree, 

interference  with 

the  same  would  not  be 

warranted.  

6. 

In view of the above, I do not find any merit 

in  this  petition  which  is  accordingly  dismissed  in 

limine.
