order/ 
proceedings 

01.          29.03.2021. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Mr. Mubeen Ali Hasnain Awan, Advocate for the 
petitioner. 

Through  the 

instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

challenged 

order 

dated 

21.10.2019  passed  by  learned  Executing  Court 

and 

judgment  dated  27.11.2019  passed  by 

learned Appellate Court. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  full  salary  of  the 

petitioner  has  been  attached  and  the  said 

amount  is  being  paid  to  the  minor  children  of 

the petitioner in compliance of order passed by 

learned  Executing  Court.  Learned  counsel 

further  contends  that  the  petitioner  has  old 

aged  parents,  he  is  also  under  treatment  and 

needs  some  money  to  feed  his  parents  as  well 

as  to  bear  the  expenses  of  his  medical 

treatment.  Learned  counsel  further  submits 

that  attachment  of  full  salary  is  not  warranted 

under  the  law  and  has  placed  reliance  on  a 

case  reported  as  “Muhammad  Aslam  VS 

Muhammad Usman and others” (2004 CLC 473), 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
wherein  it  is  held  that  full  salary  should  not  be 

attached  and  if  the  circumstances  allow,  half 

salary should be attached.
