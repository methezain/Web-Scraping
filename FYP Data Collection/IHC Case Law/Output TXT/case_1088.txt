Proceedings 
20.10.2021  Malik  Karim  Bukhsh  Awan,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

assailed 

order 

dated 

17.06.2021,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II,  East-Islamabad,  whereby  interim 

maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.50,000/-  for 

each minor per month has been fixed. 

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that vide impugned order 

learned  Trial  Court  has 

fixed 

interim 

maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.50,000/-  for 

each  minor  per  month,  which 

is  very 

exorbitant  and  is  not  according  to  financial 

position  of  the  petitioner.  The  petitioner  has 

also  purchased  three  story  house  in  the 

name  of  his  wife  and  children,  respondents 

are  residing  in  one  portion  and  getting 

monthly 

rent  of  other 

two  portions, 

documents  showing  transfer  of  house  in  the 

name  of  respondents  are  placed  on  record 

and  the  petitioner  is  also  ready  to  pay 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
monthly  maintenance  according 

to  his 

financial  status  but  the  impugned  order  is 

very  harsh  and  liable  to  be  set-aside. 

Learned counsel has placed reliance on cases 

reported  as  “Muhammad  Touseeq  Danial 

Bhatti  v.  Ayesha  Naeem  and  2  others” 

(2021  MLD  337),  “Dr. Aqueel Waris v. 

Ibrahim Aqueel Waris” (2020 CLC 131) and 

“Asim Ali v. Hira Asim and others”  (2019 

YLR 2153).
