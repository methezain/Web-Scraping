Mr. Arsheed Ali, Advocate for applicant.
Mr. TahirAfzalAbbasi,  Advocate for respondent.
Syed Shahbaz Shah, State Counsel.

Through the  instant application,
applicant (Syed Sajjad Hussain) seeks leave to

appeal in terms of Section 417 (2) Cr.P.C. from
the judgment  dated  30.11.2019, passed by
learned Judicial Magistrate  Section-30,
lslamabad  (West), whereby in his private
complaint under Section 338-b,  109 and 201
PPC, respondents 2 to 4 were acquitted  of the

charge.
2. 
Facts, relevant for the disposal of
instant application,  are that the applicant filed
a private complaint against respondents 2 to 4
with the averments  that his marriage with
respondent No.2 was culminated in divorce by
way of 'khula'on  04.05.2017,  when the latter
was pregnant  of four months and three days;
that the respondent  No.2 in connivance  with
respondents  3 and 4 caused abortion of his
child hence,  committed offence punishable
under Sections 338-b,  109 and 2O1 PPC.
3. 
ln order to substantiate  the complaint,
applicant appeared  as PW-1 and got examined
one Dr. Zeenat Usman as  PW-2. The

.L.A.  No.21of  2019

documentary evidence comprised  of Exh.PA
and Exh.PB. The respondents in  their
respective  statements under Section 342
Cr.P.C denied the allegations  and termed the
same as an attempt to settle the score as a
counterblast of family dispute.  The learned
tria! Court after hearing the parties, acguitted
the respondents  2 to 4 vide judgment dated
30.11 .2019, sought to be assailed through the
instant  P.S.L.A.
3. 
Learned counsel for the applicant
contends  that the documentary evidence
comprising  Ex.PA and Ex. PB coupled with the
statement  of  Medica! Officer/PW-2, it  is
established that the  respondent  No 2
unlawfully aborted the child, therefore,  the
acquittal on hypothesis and without  dilating
any observation upon the evidence, is liable to
be set-aside.
4.  On the contrary,  learned counsel for
private respondents  contends that essentials
to constitute the alleged offence are missing in
the instant  case and there is not an iota of
evidence to establish  abortion,  as alleged,  had
taken place.
5. 
6. 
!n order to upset an order of acquittal, it
is  mandatory  to  explore  non-reading,
misreading of the evidence besides  departure
from the law on the subject or that the findings
arrived at  are  perverse,  fanciful and
erroneous.
7. 
ln the present  case, the learned trial
Court  considered the evidence  led by the

Heard, record examined.

applicant. Moreover, PW-2 Dr. Zeenat  Usman
in her cross-examination  stated that Medical
Certificate  Ex. P2 depicts  previous history of
miscarriage of respondent  No 2; that neither
she inspected  the said document nor signed
the same. The said witness  did not utter even a

single word regarding alleged abortion.
8.  Even otherwise, applicant in  his
statement while appearing  as PW-1 did not
state anything about the alleged  abortion
except an allegation that the respondent No 2
in connivance  with respondents 3 and 4 about
5-6 months before aborted his child. There is
no allegation with certainty that on what date,
time and place the alleged  incident took place.
Mere an entry respecting previous history of
miscarriage is  not enough to  hold the
respondents 2 to 4 guilty for the alleged
offence.  lt was also for the reason that the
litigation in the shape of four cases  including
the one at hand was initiated by the applicant
after the filing of suit for dissolution of
marriage by respondent No 2. lt  was so
mentioned  by the applicant  in the beginning  of
his cross-examination.
9. 
Till this d"y, it is a settled  law that an
accused who is acquitted  by any court of
competent jurisdiction carries double
presumption of innocence, strong and cogent
reasons are required to  dislodge such
presumption.  Reliance is placed upon case
laws reported as Jehangir V. Aminullah  (2010
SCMR 491), ilst. Anwar Begum  V. Akhtar
Hussain alias  Kaka  (2017  SCAR 1710), Zaheer

Sadiq V. lluhammad  Uaz (2017 SCIIR  2007),
Muhammad  Azam V. State (2009 SCfrIR 1232),
Muhammad Shafi alias Kuddoo  V. State (2019
scMR 1045).
10.  Moreover,  in identical cases reported
as Salawal  Khan and 4 otherc  V, Amir Sultan
and 11 otherc  l2O16  P.CnLJ 929  end
lluhammad Shaft V. The State and otherc
(1992 P.Cr.LJ 1391), petition for special  leave
to appeal  assailing order of acquittal was
dismissed by observing that "when an accused
is acquitted  of the charge, he would  enjoy double
presumption of innocence in acquittal  appeal
under  Section  417 Cr.P.C  which could not be

dislodged."
11.  !n view of above, there exists no
justification  to  call for  record and re-
appreciate the evidence  which would be a
futile exercise as no apparent or even remote
infirmity  has been pointed out in the impugned
judgment. Consequently the instant  application
is accordingly dismissed  and leave  refused.
