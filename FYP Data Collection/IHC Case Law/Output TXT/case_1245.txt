VS

Ayesha Bibi and others. 

S.No. of 
order/ 
proceeding 
(01) 

Order with signature of Judge and that 
of parties or counsel where necessary. 

Date of 
order/ 
proceeding 
24.06.2021  Malik  Amjad  Zaman,  Advocate  for  the 

Petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

impugned 

order 

dated 

25.01.2021 of the learned Judge Family Court, 

whereby  order 

for  payment  of 

interim 

maintenance was passed. 

02.  Brief 

facts  of 

the  case  are 

that 

petitioner  was  married  with  the  respondent 

No.  1  on  19.08.2016,  according  to  Muslim 

Rights  and  Ceremonies  and  from  wedlock  of 

the  parties,  one  minor  daughter/respondent 

No.  2  was  born,  who  is  residing  with 

respondent No. 1/mother.  

03.  Respondent  No.  1/mother of  the  minor 

filed  a  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage, 

recovery  of  dowry  articles  and  grant  of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 2226 of 2021 

maintenance  allowance  @  Rs.  20,000/-  per 

month  for  minor/respondent  No.  2.  On 

25.01.2021,  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

fixed 

the 

interim  maintenance 

of 

minor/respondent  No.  2  @  Rs.  10,000/-  per 

month  and  being  aggrieved  by 

the 

interim/impugned  order,  the 

instant  writ 

petition has been filed.  

04.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia, contends  that  impugned  order  is  not 

maintainable in the eyes of law; the order for 

maintenance  allowance  passed  by  learned 

Judge  Family  court  is  too  harsh,  excessive, 

exorbitant, inflated, steep and over-priced. 

05.  That  the  learned  family  judge,  while 

passing  the  impugned  order  has  ignored  the 

pleading  of  the  parties  regarding  the  fact  of 

income  of  the  petitioner  mentioned  in  his 

written  statement  and  it  is  quite  impossible 

for the poor petitioner to maintain the minor 

at such excessive rate.  

06. 

Impugned 

order 

for 

interim 

maintenance  is  based  on  misreading  and 

non-reading  of  the  pleading  of  both  the 

 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 2226 of 2021 

parties.  

07.  Arguments heard, record perused.  

08. 

It  is  mentioned  in  Section  14(3)  of  the 

West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 

an interim order passed by a Family 

Court.” 

09. 

It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan 

in  a  case 

titled  as 

“President  All  Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  V. 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020 SCMR 260)”, that: 

“It is settled law that when the Statute does 

not  provide  the  right  of  appeal  against 

certain  orders,  the  same  cannot  be 

challenged  by  invoking  the  constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High Court in order to 

gain a similar objective. Where a Statute 

has expressly barred a remedy which is not 

available to a party under the Statute, it 

cannot be sought indirectly by resort to the 

constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. 

The High Courts exercising constitutional 

jurisdiction  must  be  fully  cognizant  and 

conscious of this Rule and strictly adhere to 

the same in the interest of advancing the 

policy  of  law  and  delivering  expeditious 

justice in accordance with the law and the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 2226 of 2021 

Constitution. Even otherwise, constitutional 

jurisdiction is equitable and discretionary in 

nature  and  should  not  be  exercised  to 

defeat or bypass the purpose of a validly 

enacted  statutory  provision.” 
supplied)    

(Emphasis 

10. 

In  another  case 

titled  as  “Chief 

Executive  MEPCO  and  others  V. 

Muhammad Fazil and others (2019 SCMR 

919)”,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 

has held that:  

“Where  the  Court  or  the  Tribunal  has 

jurisdiction  and  it  determines  specific 

question of fact or even of law, unless 

patent legal defect or material irregularity is 

pointed  out,  such  determination  cannot 

ordinarily be interfered with by the High 

Court  while  exercising  jurisdiction  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution.” 

11. 

It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme 

Court of Pakistan in case titled as “Chairman, 

NAB V. Muhammad Usman and others (PLD 

2018 SC 28)”, that: 

“The powers of judicial review vested in 

High  Court  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution is no doubt a great weapon in 

the Judge’s hands however, the same shall 

not be exercised in a case where discretion 

is  exercised  by  the  subordinate 

 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 2226 of 2021 

court/Tribunal in a fair and just manner 

without violating or disregarding statutory 

provision  of  law,  likely  to  occasion  the 

failure  of  justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction  shall  not  be 

exercised  at  random  and  in  routine 

manner.  The  following  case  law  is 

reproduced for the guidance of the learned 

Judges of the High Court for future course 

of action:   

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmed v. 

Government  of  Pakistan, 

through  Secretary,  Interior 

Division,  Islamabad  (1994 

SCMR 2142) 

(ii)  Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon’ble 

Judges of the High Court of 

Sindh  and  Balochistan  (PLD 

1971 SC 677) 

(iii)  Malik  Shaukat  Ali  Dogar  v. 

Ghulam Qasim Khan Khakwani 

(PLD 1994 SC 281)  

12.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  also  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Syed  Saghir  Ahmad 

Naqvi  VS  Province  of  Sindh  (1996 

SCMR 1165), it has been held as follows: 

“The statute excluding a right of 

appeal  from  the  interim  order 

cannot  be  passed  by  bringing 

under attack such interim orders 

in Constitutional jurisdiction. The 

 
 
 
  
6 

Writ Petition No. 2226 of 2021 

party affected has to wait till it 

matures  into  a  final  order  and 

then to attack it in the proper 

exclusive forum created for the 

purpose  of  examining  such 

orders.” 

(ii) 

In  the  caes  of  Mumtaz  Hussain 

alias  Butta  VS  Chief  Administrator  of 

Auqaf, Punjab (1976 SCMR 450), it has 

been held as follows:- 

“As the said Ordinance has taken 

away  the right of petitioner to 

interim  relief,  learned  counsel 

sulbmitted that this was a ground 

which  entitle  dthe  petitioner  to 

prosecute a writ petitioner despite 

the pendency of the proceedings 

on  the  District  Court.  The 

argument is misconceived because 

the writ jurisdiction of the superior 

Courts cannot be invoked in aid of 

injustice and in order to defeat the 

express provisions of the statutory 

law.” 

13.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed 

to  point  out  as 

to  how 

the 

impugned/interim order passed by the learned 

family judge was the consequence of an error 

of  law  or  without  jurisdiction  or  in  excess  of 

jurisdiction.

In  view  of  the  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
