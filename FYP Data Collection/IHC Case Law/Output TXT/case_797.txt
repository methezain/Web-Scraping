petitioner. 
Mr.  Mudassar  Hussain  Malik,  Advocate  for

At 

the  very  outset, 

learned 

counsel for  the  petitioner  submits  that  the 

matter  has already  been decided,  therefore, 

the  instant  petition  has  become  infructuous 

and  learned counsel for  the  petitioner  does 

not want to  press the  instant  petition. 

2. 

In  view  of  above, 

instant  writ 

petition  is  dismissed  as  having  become 

infructuous.
