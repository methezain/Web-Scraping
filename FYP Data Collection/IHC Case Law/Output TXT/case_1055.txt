Sh. Muhammad Khizar Ur Rashid, Advocate for petitioner. 
Mr Zia Ur Rehman, Advocate for respondents.   

Athar  Minallah,  C.J.-      Through  this 

constitutional  petition,  the  petitioner  has  assailed 

judgments  and  decrees,  dated  21-03-2016  and  28-

12-2015,  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge  (West),  Islamabad  and  the  learned  Guardian 

Judge (West), Islamabad, respectively.  

2. 

Nauman  Ali  Abbasi  through  his  father/ 

attorney,  namely  Qari  Nishan  Ali  Abbasi  filed  a 

petition    under  sections  7,  17  and  25  of  the 

Guardian and Wards Act, 1890  (hereinafter referred 

to  as  the  ‘Act  of  1890’)  seeking  custody  of  the 

minor,  namely  Rohan  Ali  Haider  Abbasi  (hereinafter 

referred  to  as  the  ‘Minor’).  The  Petitioner  and  Mst 

Safia  Ghulam  daughter  of  Ghulam  Ahmad  Abbasi

W.P.  No.1536/2016 

(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘Respondent’)  had 

entered into a marriage contract but they were later 

divorced.  The  petitioner  was  seeking  custody  of  the 

Minor  through  the  petition  filed  by  his  father.  The 

learned  Guardian  Judge  (West),  Islamabad  vide 

judgment and decree, dated 28-11-2015, dismissed 

the  petition.  However,  a  schedule  was  prescribed 

regarding  visitation  rights.  The  petitioner  preferred 

an appeal but that too was dismissed vide judgment 

and decree, dated 21-03-2016. 

3. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has been heard at great length. He has argued that; 

the  learned  appellate  court  has  misinterpreted  the 

provisions  of 

the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964 

(hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘Act  of  1964’);  the 

petition was filed under the Guardian and Wards Act, 

1890  and,  therefore,  the  provision  of  the  Act  of 

1964  were  not  applicable;  the  impugned  judgment 

and decrees are not sustainable. 

4. 

The  record  has  been  perused  with  the 

able  assistance  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner.

5. 

The 

learned  Guardian 

Judge  after 

considering  the  welfare  of  the  Minor  had  dismissed 

the  petition  filed  by  the  petitioner.  However,  an 

order  was  passed  regarding  the  visitation  rights  of 

the petitioner. The learned appellate court dismissed 

the appeal on the sole ground that the petition filed 

by the father of the petitioner was not competent. It 

is  not  disputed  that  the  petition  filed  by  the 

petitioner was not signed and verified in the manner 

prescribed  under  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908 

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘CPC’). Section 10 of 

the  Act  of  1890  explicitly  provides  that  if  an 

application is not made by the Collector, then it shall 

be  through  a  petition  signed  and  verified  in  the 

manner  prescribed  under  the  CPC  for  signing  and 

verification of a plaint. The argument of the learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  the  requirements 

prescribed under CPC regarding filing of a plaint are 

not attracted in case of a petition filed under the Act 

of  1890,  is  misconceived  in  the  light  of  the  explicit 

provisions  of  section  10  of  the  Act  of  1890. 

Moreover,  the  learned  Guardian  Judge  (West)  after 

carefully  perusing  the  record  had  passed  a  well-

reasoned 

judgment,  dated  28-11-2015.  The 

reasoning  regarding  welfare  of  the  child  does  not

suffer  from  any  legal  infirmity  nor  interference  is 

required  therewith  while  exercising  jurisdiction  of 

this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of 

the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. 

6. 

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  petition 

is  without  merit  and  is,  therefore,  accordingly 

dismissed.
