in 

  The  petitioner  has  appeared  in  person 

and  he  has  been  asked  as  to  why  he  should 

not  be  prosecuted  for  perjury  given  that  the 

affidavit  filed  alongwith  this  petition  states 

that  he  makes  an  amount  of  Rs.76,000/-  per 

month, even though he has subsequently filed 

another  affidavit,  which  reflects  that  at  the 

time  of  filing  of  the  appeal,  he  was  drawing 

the salary of Rs.250,000/-. 

2.    He has been unable to give a satisfactory 

response  to  this  Court.  He  has,  however, 

informed  this  Court  that  his  counsel  is  busy 

before the august Supreme Court.  

3.    Let  the  matter  be  fixed  on  30.05.2022 

for  final  arguments.  The  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  will  also  address  arguments  on 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
why the petitioner ought not be prosecuted for 

perjury under Pakistan Penal Code.
