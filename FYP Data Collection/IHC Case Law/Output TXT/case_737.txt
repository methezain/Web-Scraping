The  instant  writ  petition  is  arising  out 

of  order  dated  23.12.2021,  passed  by  the 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Family-

Guardian  Court,  East-Islamabad,  whereby 

application  of  the  petitioner  for  conducting 

DNA  test  of  the  minor  was  dismissed  by 

observing that:- 

“It  appears  that  by  filing  application 
for  DNA  Test  of  the  minor,  the 
judgment  debtor  intends  to  earn  a 
relief  which  cannot  be  granted  in 
execution  proceedings  for  which  this 
Court has very limited jurisdiction”. 

2-  

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contends  that  the  petitioner  and  respondent 

No.1  got  married  in  the  year  2014  and  out  of 

their  wedlock  one  daughter  ‘Zainab  Khatoon 

was  born.  The  respondent  No.  1  lived  with 

petitioner for almost 1-1/2 year but during this 

period, once she left the house of petitioner for 

three  months  without  any  reason  and  gone  to 

her  parents’  home.  After  three  months  her 

mother  forcefully  sent  her  back  to  petitioner’s 

home.

3-  

Further  contends  that  after  re-joining 

the  petitioner,  she  disclosed  that  she  is 

pregnant of one month, though she was not in 

physical relation with the petitioner. The same 

story  was  disclosed  by  petitioner  before  his 

family members, thereafter petitioner has filed 

a  suit  for  declaration  to  the  effect  that  the 

petitioner  is  not  the  biological  father  of  the 

minor,  which  is  pending  before  Senior  Civil 

Judge,  Islamabad.  He  added 

that  minor 

namely  Zainab  Khatoon  was  not  alive  and 

minor  living  with  respondent  No.  1  is  not  the 

actual/real  Zainab  Khatoon,  in  this  context 

petitioner  has  filed  an  application  for  the  DNA 

test  of  the  minor,  which  was  dismissed  vide 

impugned order. Hence, instant writ petition. 

4-  

5-  

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Record  reveals  that  petitioner  and 

respondent  No.  1  was 

in  matrimonial 

relationship  and  out  of  their  wedlock,  minor 

Zainab Khatoon was born. After birth of minor, 

petitioner  denied  the  parentage  of  minor, 

whereupon respondent No 1 has filed a suit for 

recovery  of  maintenance  allowance  which  was 

exparte decreed in her favour and the learned 

trial  court  fixed  the  monthly  maintenance  as 

Rs.  3500/-  per  month  vide  order  dated 

14.04.2018. 

6-  

It  is  also  a  matter  of  record  that  the 

respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of 

maintenance  on  30.07.2017.  The  petitioner 

had  been  contesting  the  same  and  on  his 

failure to pay interim maintenance, his right of

defence  was  struck  off  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court,  Islamabad  (East)  vide  order 

dated  14.04.2018.    According  to  petitioner’s 

own version, he has filed a suit for declaration 

to the effect that he is not the biological father 

of  the  minor.  The  impugned  order  is  outcome 

of  the  proceedings  being  conducted  by  the 

learned  Executing  Court  for  the  recovery  of 

maintenance  of  the  minor  imposed  upon  the 

petitioner.  

7-  

It  appears 

that 

the  petitioner 

is 

lingering  on  the  matter  just  to  avoid  payment 

pursuant  to  decree  of  maintenance  allowance.  

The  relief  being  claim  did  not  fall  within  the 

ambit  of  an  Executing  Court  due  to  having 

limited  scope  wherein  if  has  only  to  get 

execute  the  decree.  It  this  practice  is  allowed 

to  prevail,  then  there  will  be  no  end  to  the 

litigation and no decree will be executed. Filing 

of baseless applications would not only amount 

to  abuse  of  process  of  law  but  also  result  in 

wasting  precious  time  of  the  Court  which  can 

well  be  utilised  for  imparting  justice  to  the 

aggrieved persons.  

8-  

The  impugned  order  in  the  attending 

circumstances  of  the  case  appears  to  be  just, 

proper  and  does  not  call  for  any  interference. 

Consequently,  the  instant  writ  petition  is 

dismissed in limine.
