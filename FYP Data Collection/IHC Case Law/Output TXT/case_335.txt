MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the  instant  writ 

petition the petitioner, Rubina Amjad, impugns the order dated 27.01.2020 

passed  by  the  Court  of  the  learned  Civil  Judge,  Islamabad,  whereby  her 

application  under  Section  12(2)  of  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908 

(“C.P.C.”)  against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017,  was 

dismissed.  

2. 

The  record  shows  that  vide  allotment  letter  No.CDA/EM-27(194)/71 

dated  22.09.1971,  the  Capital  Development  Authority  (“C.D.A.”)  allotted 

Plot  No.13-I,  Markaz  F-7,  Islamabad  to  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique.  After 

construction  of  a  building  on  the  said  plot  was  completed,  a  lease  deed 

was  executed  on  30.01.1985  between  the  C.D.A.  and  Mrs.  Saeeda 

Shafique with respect to the said plot for a period of thirty-three years. It is 

not disputed that Mrs. Saeeda Shafique transferred 2/3rd share in the said 

plot  to  her  two  sons  namely  Pervaiz  Shafique  Siddiqui  /  respondent  No.2 

(“Pervaiz”) and Iqbal Shafique Siddiqui / respondent No.3 (“Iqbal”). 

3.  Mrs. Saeeda Shafique died on 08.01.2011. She was survived by her 

husband,  Shafique  A.  Siddique,  who  died  on  10.02.2017;  three  sons 

namely  (i)  Javaid  Shafique  Siddiqui  /  respondent  No.1  (“Javaid”),  (ii)

Pervaiz  and  (iii)  Iqbal;  and  three  daughters  namely  Rubina  Amjad  / 

petitioner  (“Rubina”),  Shahnaz  Shafique  Siddiqui  /  respondent  No.4 

(“Shahnaz”)  and  Gulnar  Shafique  Siddiqui  /  respondent  No.5  (“Gulnar”). 

The  Court  of  the  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Islamabad,  on  08.01.2013, 

issued  a  succession  certificate  recognizing  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique’s 

husband, three sons and three daughters as her legal heirs. 

4. 

On  16.03.2013,  Rubina  filed  a  suit  for  declaration  and  separate 

possession through partition of Mrs. Saeeda Shafique’s properties before 

the  Court  of  the  learned  Civil  Judge,  Lahore.  Javaid,  who  was  defendant 

No.2 in the said suit, raised an objection to the maintainability of the said 

suit  on  the  ground  that  the  properties  situated  in  Islamabad  could  not 

have been made part of the subject matter of the said suit. Due to the said 

objection,  Rubina  withdrew  the  said  suit  only  to  the  extent  of  the 

properties situated in Islamabad.

SIDDIQUI  ETC.”  FILED  BEFORE  THE  LEARNED  CIVIL  COURT  AT 
ISLAMABAD:-

of document,  recovery  of rental amounts  / mesne  profits,  and  permanent 

and  mandatory  injunction  before  the  Court  of  the  learned  Civil  Judge, 

Islamabad. In the said suit,  Rubina had sought a declaration to the effect 

that all the legal heirs of Mrs. Saeeda Shafique are owners of her share in 

properties  including  commercial  building  on  Plot  No.13-I,  Markaz  F-7, 

Islamabad  (“Property  No.1”)  and  House  No.1,  Street  No.4,  Sector  F-6/3, 

Islamabad  (“Property  No.2”)  in  accordance  with  the  Islamic  law  of 

inheritance.  Rubina  had  also  sought  a  declaration  to  the  effect  that  the 

memorandum  of  gift  dated  14.12.2010,  on  the  basis  of  which  Javaid 

asserted  ownership  over  1/3rd  share 

in  Property  No.1,  was  fake, 

fabricated,  bogus,  and  liable  to  be  cancelled.  She  had  also  sought  a 

declaration  to  the  effect  that  Javaid’s  claim  that  Shafique  A.  Siddiqui, 

Shahnaz and  Gulnar  had  orally  gifted  their respective  shares  in  Property 

No.2 to him to be unlawful. 

6. 

Javaid contested the said suit by filing a written statement wherein it 

was pleaded inter alia that 1/3rd share in Property No.1 belonging to Mrs. 

Saeeda Shafique had been orally gifted to him and that he had taken over

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

possession  of  the  said  share  on  28.08.2010.  It  was  also  pleaded  that  the 

said  oral  gift  was  confirmed  through  a  memorandum  of  gift  dated 

14.12.2010.  Shafique  A.  Siddiqui  (Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique’s  widower)  had 

also filed a written statement to Rubina’s suit pleading that 1/3rd share in 

Property No.1 had been gifted by his wife to Javaid. As regards Property 

No.2,  it  was  pleaded  that  Shafique  A.  Siddiqui,  Shahnaz  and  Gulnar  had 

orally  gifted  their  shares  in  the  said  property  to  Javaid,  and  that  an 

acknowledgment of the gift in this regard was executed by the said donors 

on 28.08.2012.

Shahnaz and Gulnar had gifted their shares in Property No.2 to Javaid and 

had executed acknowledgments of the gift on 28.08.2012. In the said suit, 

it was prayed that in view of the said gift, Javaid be declared as the owner 

in  possession  of  his  own  share  as  well  as  those  of  Shafique  A.  Siddiqui, 

Shahnaz and Gulnar in Property No.2. Javaid had also sought a direction 

to the C.D.A. to record himself, Pervaiz, Iqbal, and Rubina as co-owners of 

the  said  property.  Javaid  had  also  sought  the  partition  of  Property  No.2 

between himself, Pervaiz, Iqbal, and Rubina.

COURT AT ISLAMABAD:- 

8. 

On  14.04.2016,  Javaid  filed  a  suit  for  declaration,  partition  and

had gifted her 1/3rd share in Property No.1 to Javaid and in this regard had 

executed  a  memorandum  of  gift  on  14.12.2010.  It  was  also  pleaded  that

acknowledgments  dated  28.07.2012,  06.08.2012  and  06.07.2015 

acknowledging the execution of the said memorandum  of gift. In  the said

SETTLEMENT  AND  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  AGREEMENT  DATED 
20.09.2016 (“SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT”):- 

9. 

It was during the pendency of civil suits No.458/2015, 153/2016 and 

154/2016  that  a  settlement  was  arrived  at  between  Rubina  on  the  one 

hand  and  Javaid,  Pervaiz  and  Iqbal  on  the  other.  The  terms  of  this 

agreement  show  that  the  three  brothers  paid  Rs.25  million  to  Rubina 

through  (i)  pay  order  No.01906871,  dated  20.09.2016  for  an  amount  of 

Rs.21 million drawn on Silk Bank Limited, and (ii) pay order No.03657006, 

dated  20.09.2016  for  an  amount  of  Rs.4  million  drawn  on  Faysal  Bank

deprivations in the past, if any and shares of Mr. Shafique A. Siddiqui 

(father) in any company at present or in the past and in Commercial and 

Residential buildings in Islamabad, [and] jewelry if any.”  Paragraphs  6(i) 

and  (ii)  of  the  said  agreement  show  that  Rubina  was  obligated  to 

unconditionally  withdraw  the  suit  titled  “Rubina  Amjad  VS  Shafique  A. 

Siddiqui etc.” pending before the learned Civil Court at Islamabad, and to 

file an application praying for the suit titled “Javaid Shafique Siddiqui VS 

Public  at  Large  etc.”  to  be  decreed,  whereas  paragraph  6(iii)  of  the  said 

agreement shows that Rubina was obligated to withdraw her applications 

filed  under  Order  I,  Rule  10  C.P.C.  in  the  ejectment  petitions  filed  by 

Javaid  and Iqbal against  tenants in Property No.1.  Furthermore, she was 

placed  under  an  obligation  to  make  all  efforts  and  give  a  statement 

recognizing  the  petitioners  in  the  said  ejectment  petitions  to  be  the  sole 

owners and landlords “of the commercial building.”  

10. 

It is not denied that Rubina had issued a receipt for having received 

two pay orders for a cumulative amount of Rs.25 million from her brothers 

pursuant to the terms of the said agreement dated 20.09.2016.  

11.  The  order  sheet  of  both  the  suits  instituted  by  Javaid  (i.e.,  suits 

No.153/2016  “Javaid  Shafique  Siddiqui  VS  Public  at  Large  etc.”  and 

154/2016  “Javaid  Shafique  Siddiqui  VS  Public  at  Large  etc.”)  reveal  that 

Rubina’s  counsel,  on  21.09.2016,  produced  a  copy  of  the  settlement 

agreement  dated  20.09.2016  as  Exh.C/1  and  applied  for  the  said  suits  to 

be  decreed  in  favour  of  Javaid.  Rubina’s  counsel  also  recorded  his 

statement to the effect that he does not object to the  said suits instituted 

 
 
 
 
 
5 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

by Javaid being decreed. Accordingly, vide judgments and decrees dated 

08.02.2017,  the  learned  Civil  Court decreed  the said  suits.  The  operative 

part  of  the  judgment  dated  08.02.2017  whereby  civil  suit  No.154/2016 

(which  pertains  to  Property  No.1)  was  decreed  is  reproduced  herein

“10.  In sequence to above discussion the suit of plaintiff is hereby 
decreed as prayed for therefore, on the basis of memorandum of gift

share in commercial property bearing No.13-I, Sector F-7 Islamabad 
alongwith defendants No.4 & 5 and defendant No.10 is directed to record 
the name of plaintiff in the relevant record subject to codal and legal 
formalities. As the learned counsel for the plaintiff got recorded his 
statement and did not press the relief as to the partition therefore, to that 
extent the suit of plaintiff be dismissed. Decree sheet be accordingly 
framed. Parties are left to bear their own costs. File be consigned to 
record room after due completion.” 

12.  As  regards  suit  No.458/2015  instituted  by  Rubina,  she  filed  an 

application  on  21.09.2016  before  the 

learned  Civil  Court  for  the 

withdrawal of the said suit. In the second paragraph of her application, it 

was pleaded that “with the intervention of elders of the family, all illusions 

have been cleared and misunderstandings between the families have 

been removed and a settlement of all issues has been made effective 

between the parties.” On 21.09.2016, the learned Civil Court recorded the 

statement  of  Rubina’s  counsel  to  the  effect  that  due  to  the  settlement 

between  the  parties,  the  suit  should  be  dismissed  as  withdrawn.  Vide 

order  dated  03.10.2016,  the 

learned  Civil  Court  allowed  Rubina’s 

application  for  the  withdrawal  of  her  suit  and  consequently  the  said  suit 

was dismissed as withdrawn.

No.154/2016  filed  by  Javaid  with  respect  to  Property  No.1  had  been 

decreed. Rubina contested the said application by filing a written reply. In 

the  said  reply,  it  was  pleaded  inter alia  that  even  though  Shahnaz  had 

been in the knowledge of the civil suit that culminated in the passing of the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017,  she  opted  not  to  appear  before 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

the  Court  or  to  join  the  proceedings.  Furthermore,  it  was  pleaded  that 

Shahnaz  had  tried  to  mislead  the  Court  by  portraying  that  she  had 

approached  the  Court  for  cancellation  of  the  acknowledgment  dated 

06.08.2012 executed by her in favour of Javaid wherein she had admitted 

the execution of the memorandum of gift dated 14.12.2010 by her mother 

(Mrs. Saeeda  Shafique) in favour of Javaid.  Vide order dated 11.03.2019, 
the learned Civil Court disposed of the said application.  

APPLICATION  UNDER  SECTION  12(2)  C.P.C.  FILED  BY  RUBINA 
AGAINST  THE  JUDGMENT  AND  DECREE  DATED  08.02.2017 
WHEREBY  SUIT  NO.154  OF  2016  TITLED  “JAVAID  SHAFIQUE 
SIDDIQUI VS PUBLIC AT LARGE ETC.” WAS DECREED:-  

14.  On  25.11.2019  (i.e.,  two  years  and  nine  months  after  the  judgment 

and  decree  dated  08.02.2017),  Rubina  filed  an  application  under  Section 

12(2) C.P.C. assailing the judgment and decree dated 08.02.2017 passed 

in  suit  No.154/2016  titled  “Javaid  Shafique  Siddiqui  VS  Public  at  Large 

etc.”  which  was  with  respect  to  Property  No.1.  In  the  said  application, 

Javaid  was  respondent  No.1  whereas  Pervaiz  and  Iqbal  were  impleaded 

as respondents No.2 and 3, respectively. In the said application, Rubina’s 

version as regards the withdrawal of her suit and the decree passed in the 

two  suits  instituted  by  Javaid  as  well  as  her  interpretation  of  the 

settlement  agreement  dated  20.09.2016  is  set  out  in  paragraph  6  of  the 

said  application  which  for  the  purposes  of  clarity  is  reproduced  herein 

below:- 

“That during the pendency of abovementioned suits one filed by petitioner 
and two filed by respondent No.1 a broader consensus was reached 
between petitioner and respondents No.1 to 3 and it was agreed that 
abovementioned suit would be got decided as soon as possible and

predecessor in interest of petitioner (Saeeda Shafiqueue) would remain 
intact and she would not press of partition of the abovesaid property now 
but after adjustment of rights of the other legal heirs and properties being 
owned by less co-sharers then they would be sold by the petitioner and 

 
 
 
 
 
7 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

respondents No.1 and 3 by themselves which would attract a better 
bargain and price. Thereupon petitioner withdrew her suit for Declaration, 
Cancellation or Document, Recovery of Rental Amount / Mesne Profit,

Permanent Injunction regarding suit property as well as house No.1, 
Street No.4, Sector F-6/3, Islamabad that she has no objection if both the 
suit are decreed in favour of respondent No.1.” 

15.  Vide  order  dated  27.01.2020,  the  learned  Civil  Court  dismissed 

Rubina’s  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  The  said  order  was 

assailed  by  Rubina  in  a  revision  petition  filed  on  26.02.2020  before  the 

Court  of  the  learned  District  Judge,  Islamabad.  Rubina  had  not  annexed 

the  certified  copies  of  the  record  along  with  her  revision  petition. 

Therefore,  she  sought  the  withdrawal  of  her  revision  petition  with 

permission  to  file  afresh.  Vide  order  dated  27.02.2020,  the  Court  of  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  dismissed  the  revision 

petition with permission to file afresh.  

16.  The Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2020 was enacted on 

18.02.2020,  Section  15  whereof  substituted  Section  115  C.P.C.  with  the 

following:- 

“115. Revision.--Any party aggrieved by an order under Section 104, 
passed by the Court of District Judge or Additional District Judge in an 
appeal against an interlocutory order passed by a Civil Judge or Senior 
Civil Judge, as the case may be, may within thirty days of the said order 
may file a revision to the High Court on an obvious mis-apprehension of 
law or in respect of a defect in jurisdiction.” 

17.  On  19.05.2020,  Rubina  filed  the  instant  writ  petition  against  the 

order  dated  27.01.2020  whereby  the  learned  Civil  Court  dismissed  her 

application under Section 12(2) C.P.C.  

18. 

It may be mentioned that on 28.04.2020, Rubina has filed yet another 

suit  for  declaration,  partition  /  administration,  permanent  and  mandatory 

injunction  against inter alia  her  brothers  before  the  Court  of  the  learned 

Civil Judge, Lahore. In paragraph 6 of the said suit, it is pleaded that her 

brothers  had  “managed  and maneuvered  fabricated  documents  and 

statements and by attributing to [the petitioner] in the name of alleged 

compromise, settlement and relinquishment etc.”  and  that  her  brothers 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

tried to usurp her share in her mother’s inheritance in properties including 

Property No.1.  

19.  Learned counsel for the petitioner / Rubina, after narrating the facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition,  submitted  that  Javaid  had 

asserted ownership rights over 1/3rd share in Property No.1 on the basis of 

an  oral  gift  by  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique  and  the  memorandum  of  gift  dated 

14.12.2010;  that  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique’s  signatures  on  the  said 

memorandum of gift are forged; that on 14.12.2010, Mrs. Saeeda Shafique 

was unwell and she died 25 days later, i.e. on 08.01.2011; that the medical 

report  from  the  Doctors  Hospital  and  Medical  Centre,  Lahore  shows  that 

Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique  was  76  years  old  when  she  was  admitted  in  the 

hospital  between  12.11.2010  and  16.11.2010  and  between  11.12.2010 

until  her  death  on  08.01.2011;  that  the  said  report  also  shows  that  Mrs. 

Saeeda Shafique had undergone Haemodialysis for acute renal failure and 

had  been  Tracheomtomised  on  31.12.2010;  that  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique 

could not have been in a fit mental or physical state to have executed the 

memorandum  of  gift  while  admitted 

in  hospital;  that  during  the 

proceedings before the learned Civil Court,  Rubina  relied on handwriting 

expert’s  report  dated  08.05.2015  according  to  which  Mrs.  Saeeda 

Shafique’s  signatures  on  the  memorandum  of  gift  dated  14.12.2010  are 

forged;  that  the 

learned  Civil  Court  had 

issued  summons  to  the 

handwriting expert to appear before the Court on 25.02.2016; that  before 

the  handwriting  expert  could  be  cross-examined,  Settlement  Agreement 

dated  20.09.2016  was  executed  between  Rubina  and  her  three  brothers; 

that the said Settlement Agreement cannot be interpreted in a manner as 

to  cause  Rubina’s  share  in  Property  No.1  that  she  inherited  from  her 

mother  to  be  relinquished  in  Javaid’s  favour;  that  Rubina  does  not  deny 

having  received  Rs.25  million  from  her  brothers  but  this  amount  was  in 

lieu  of  “past  deprivations”  and  not  for  her  share  in  Property  No.1;  that 

Rubina  had  never  authorized  Bashir  Ahmed,  Advocate  to  file  a  reply  to 

Shanaz’s application under Section 12(2) C.P.C.; that Rubina’s signatures 

on  the  said  reply  are  forged;  that  Rubina  could  not  take  action  against 

Bashir  Ahmed,  Advocate  since  he  had  passed  away;  that  although 

Rubina’s    lead  counsel  was  Muhammad  Rizwan  Awan,  Advocate,  he  was 

 
 
 
 
9 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

not to be blamed because he had been asked by Bashir Ahmed, Advocate 

not to  attend  the proceedings before the Court;  that Rubina  had filed the 

application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  within  the 

limitation  period 

provided  by  law;  that  the  learned  Civil  court  erred  by  not  framing  issues 

and  recording  evidence  before  dismissing  Rubina’s  application  under 

Section 12(2) C.P.C.; and that since Rubina has been deprived of her due 

share  in the inheritance from  her mother in Property  No.1,  the impugned 

order dated 27.01.2020 is liable to be set-aside.  

20.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  /  Javaid 

submitted  that  at  no  material  stage  did  Rubina  challenge  the  Settlement 

Agreement dated 20.09.2016; that Rubina does not deny receipt of Rs.25 

million  in  the  form  of  pay  orders  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  the  said 

Settlement  Agreement;  that  Rubina’s  conduct  of  filing  an  application 

dated  21.09.2016  for  the  unconditional  withdrawal  of  suit  No.458/2015 

establishes that as a result of the Settlement Agreement she was left with 

no  share  in  Property  No.1;  that  Rubina  does  not  deny  her  signatures  on 

the said application wherein it was clearly pleaded that she did not want to 

pursue  her  suit;  that  the  said  application  for  unconditional  withdrawal  of 

suit  No.458/2015  filed  by  Rubina  was  allowed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court 

vide order dated 03.10.2016; that Rubina’s counsel had also recorded his 

statement  on  21.09.2016  before  the  learned  Civil  Court  to  the  effect  that 

she had no objection if suit No.154/2016 filed by Javaid was decreed; that 

as a result of the said statement, Javaid’s suit was decreed by the learned 

Civil Court on 08.02.2017; that Rubina has not filed an appeal against the 

said judgment and  decree dated 08.02.2017; that  Rubina was well aware 

about the import of the said judgment and decree since she had resisted 

her  sister  Shahnaz’s  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  against  the 

said  judgment  and  decree;  that  in  Rubina’s  reply  to  Shahnaz’s  said 

application, it was clearly pleaded that the said judgment and decree was 

validly  passed;  that  the  said  reply  bears  Rubina’s  signatures  which  have 

not  been  subjected  to  scrutiny  by  a  handwriting  expert;  that  the 

application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  has  been  filed  by  Rubina  with 

inordinate delay and with the purpose to extort more money from Javaid; 

and  that  the  interpretation  that  Rubina  wants  to  give  the  Settlement 

 
 
 
 
10 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

Agreement  is  contrary  to  the  explicit  language  of  the  same.  Learned 

counsel for Javaid prayed for the writ petition to be dismissed with costs. 

21.  Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2 

/  Pervaiz  adopted  the 

arguments of the learned counsel for Javaid. 

22. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance. The facts leading to the filing of the instant petition have been 

set  out  in  sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  2  to  18  above  and  need  not  be 

recapitulated. 

23. 

In  suit  No.458/2015  filed  by  Rubina,  she  had  prayed  for inter alia  a 

declaration  to  the  effect  that  she  along  with  other  legal  heirs  of  Mrs. 

Saeeda  Shafique  are  owners  of  Property  No.1  and  Property  No.2  in 

accordance  with  the  Islamic  law  of  inheritance.  She  had  also  sought  a 

declaration to the effect that the memorandum of gift dated 14.12.2010 on 

the  basis  of  which  Javaid  claimed  to  be  the  owner  of  1/3rd  share  in 

Property No.1 was fake, fabricated and bogus and liable to be cancelled.  

24.  Rubina  does  not  deny  the  execution  of  the  Settlement  Agreement 

dated 20.09.2016 with her three brothers, including Javaid. Paragraph 6(i) 

of the said Agreement shows that Rubina was obligated to unconditionally 

withdraw suit No.458/2015.  

25.  On  21.09.2016,  Rubina  filed  an  application  for  the  unconditional 

withdrawal  of  suit  No.458/2015.  In  the  said  application,  it  has  been 

pleaded inter alia that she does not want to pursue her suit as “all illusions 

have been cleared and misunderstandings between the family have been 

removed and a settlement of all issues has been made effective between 

the parties.” The said application has admittedly been signed by Rubina.  

26.  The  said  application  was  allowed  by  the  learned  Civil  Court,  and 

consequently  suit  No.458/2015  filed  by  Rubina  was  dismissed  as 

withdrawn  vide  order  dated  03.10.2016.  The  said  order  has  not  been 

recalled at any material stage.  

27.  Now,  Rubina  had  filed  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  to 

challenge  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017,  whereby  suit 

No.154/2016  filed  by  Javaid  was  decreed.  In  the  said  suit,  Javaid  had 

prayed for a declaration to the effect that he was the owner of 1/3rd share 

 
 
 
 
11 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

in  Property  No.1  on  the  basis  of  a  memorandum  of  gift  dated  14.12.2010 

executed  by  his  mother,  Mrs.  Saeeda  Shafique,  in  his  favour.  The  said 

judgment  and  decree  was  passed  after  Rubina  executed  the  Settlement 

Agreement  dated  20.09.2016  with  her  three  brothers,  including  Javaid. 

This  Settlement  Agreement  was  produced  before  the  learned  Civil  Court 

as Exh.C/1. Paragraph 6(ii) of the said Agreement obligated Rubina to file 

an  application  before  the  learned  Civil  Court  praying  for  the  suit  filed  by 

Javaid to be decreed. After the learned Civil Court recorded the statement 

of  Rubina’s  counsel  on  21.09.2016  to  the  effect  that  Rubina  had  no 

objection  if  the  said  suit  was  decreed,  the  learned  Civil  Court  vide 

judgment and decree dated 08.02.2017 decreed the said suit.  

28.  By  filing  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  against  the  said 

judgment and decree Rubina is, in effect, re-agitating the very same claim 

of ownership of a share in Property No.1 which she had prayed for in suit 

No.458/2015  which  she  had  unconditionally  withdrawn.  Rubina  having 

withdrawn the said suit without permission of the Court to file afresh, had 

relinquished  her  claim  agitated  therein  and  was  precluded  from  re-

agitating the same claim in subsequent proceedings. 

29. 

In  suit  No.154/2016  instituted  by  Javaid,  he  asserted  his  ownership 

rights over 1/3rd share in Property No.1 on the basis of an oral gift said to 

have  been  made  by  his  mother  in  his  favour  and  supplemented  by  a 

memorandum  of  gift  dated  14.12.2010.  He  also  asserted  that  other  than 

Rubina,  his  siblings  and  father  had  executed  an  acknowledgment  of  the 

said  gift.  In  suit  No.458/2015  instituted  by  Rubina,  she  terms  the  said 

memorandum  of gift as “a bogus and fabricated document and the same 

have been prepared by [Javaid] with a malafide intention to deprive the 

plaintiff as well as other legal heirs from their lawful rights.”  Upon 

unconditionally  withdrawing  the  said  suit,  Rubina  would  be  deemed  to 

have abandoned the said assertion. Additionally, by giving consent for suit 

No.154/2016 instituted by Javaid to be decreed, Rubina would be deemed 

to  have  accepted  Javaid’s  plea  that  his  mother’s  1/3rd  share  in  Property 

No.1 had been gifted to him. 

30.  Rubina  does  not  deny  the  execution  of  the  Settlement  Agreement. 

She,  however,  disputes  the  interpretation  of  the  Settlement  Agreement 

 
 
 
 
12 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

that the rest of her family gives it. The interpretation that Rubina places on 

the  said  Agreement  is  encapsulated  in  paragraph  6  of  her  application 

under Section 12(2) C.P.C. She pleads that the Settlement Agreement was 

a “broader consensus” between herself and her brothers, and that it was 

agreed  that the  one suit  filed  by  Rubina  and  the two suits  filed  by  Javaid 

“would be got decided as soon as possible and petitioner would not press 

[for] partition” of Property No.1 and Property No.2 which would be sold by 

Rubina  and  her  three brothers  after  the  adjustment  of  the  rights  of  other 

co-sharers.  Furthermore,  it  has  been  pleaded  that  Rubina’s  share  in  the 

said  properties  was  to  be  kept  intact  in  both  the  properties  and  for  the 

past “discriminations, deprivations and to earn the trust and to satisfy the 

past unjust treatment and to appease and console [the] petitioner an 

amount of Rs.25 million were paid to the petitioner.”  

31. 

I have read and re-read the Settlement Agreement but have not been 

able  to  bring  myself  to  give  it  an  interpretation  which  is  in  consonance 

with  the  one  being  given  to  it  by  Rubina.  The  said  Agreement  does  not 

provide for Property No.1 to be sold or Rubina’s share in the said property 

to be kept intact after their sale. Clause 9 of the said Agreement, however, 

provides that Rubina shall sign a sale deed of Property No.2 whenever it is 

sold  subject  to  receiving  the  sale  proceeds  of  her  share  in  the  property 

from  the  prospective  buyer.  Rubina  does  not  dispute  that  after  the 

execution  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  Property  No.2  was  indeed  sold 

and she received her entire share in the sale consideration. Unlike clause 

9,  there  is  no  provision  in  the  Settlement  Agreement  for  the  sale  of 

Property No.1 or for  Rubina to  receive any of the proceeds from the sale 

of Property No.1.  

32. 

In  construing  terms  of  an  agreement,  the  conduct  of  the  parties 

thereto is of vital importance. In the case of Sandoz Limited VS Federation 

of  Pakistan  (1995  SCMR  1431),  it  was  held  that  “it is a well settled 

proposition of law that in case of any ambiguity in a contract document, 

the Court in order to resolve it and to ascertain the real intention of the 

parties,  can  have  resort  to  the  correspondence  preceding  and/or 

subsequent to the execution of the contract document, conduct of the 

parties and the attending circumstances.”  Additionally, in the case of Al-

 
 
 
 
13 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

Abdullah Construction (Pvt.) Ltd. VS WAPDA (2003 YLR 1535), the Hon'ble 

High Court of Sindh inter alia held as follows:- 

“23. The language of a provision of contract has to be interpreted in a 
manner to gather the intent of the parties. But, at the same time, the 
eventualities which are not covered should also be read into it by 
examining the conduct of the parties.” 

33.  After  the  Settlement  Agreement  was  executed  Rubina’s  counsel, 

namely Muhammad Rizwan Awan, Advocate, whose authority  Rubina  has 

not  questioned  at  any  stage,  on  21.09.2016,  produced  a  copy  of  the 

Settlement  Agreement  as  Exh.C/1  and  had  his  statement  recorded  that 

Rubina  has  no  objection  if  suit  No.154/2016  was  decreed  in  Javaid’s 

favour.  On  the  very  same  day,  the  same  counsel  for  Rubina  filed  an 

application for the withdrawal of suit No.458/2015 filed by Rubina and had 

his statement recorded that since the contesting parties had settled their 

disputes, the said suit was being withdrawn on  the instruction of  Rubina. 

Incidentally,  the  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  against  the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017  passed  in  civil  suit  No.154/2016 

was  filed  by  Rubina  through  Muhammad  Rizwan  Awan,  Advocate,  who 

was  the  counsel  on  the  basis  of  whose  statement  dated  21.09.2016  civil 

suit No.458/2015 was withdrawn and civil suit No.154/2016 was decreed.  

34.  The withdrawal of Rubina’s suit No.458/2015 and the decree passed 

in  suit  No.154/2016  is  clearly  commensurate  with  the  terms  of  the 

Settlement  Agreement  which  obligated  Rubina 

to  unconditionally 

withdraw  her  suit  on  21.09.2016  and  to  file  an  application  conceding  to 

Javaid’s suit No.154/2016 being decreed in his favour. For the purposes of 

clarity,  paragraph  6(i)  and  (ii)  of  the  Settlement  Agreement  are 

reproduced herein below:- 

“i.  To  unconditionally  withdraw  her  suit  titled  Robina  Amjad  VS 
Shafique A. Siddiqi and others pending in the court of Mr. Shoaib 
Akhtar, Civil Judge (West), Islamabad which is next fixed for 21-09-
2016  by  moving  an  application  and  giving  a  No  Objection  / 
Statement before the court herself or through her counsel. 

ii.  To make a prayer before the court of Mr. Shoaib Akhtar, Civil Judge 
(West), Islamabad for decreeing the suit titled Javaid Shafique 
Siddiqi VS Public at large and others which is also fixed for 21-09-
2016. In this respect she will move an Application on Behalf of Mrs. 
Robina Amjad / Defendant No.3 for passing of decree in favour of 
the plaintiff.” 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

35. 

It may also be mentioned that Rubina’s brothers had filed ejectment 

petitions  against  tenants  in  Property  No.1.  Rubina  had  filed  applications 

under  Order  I,  Rule  10  C.P.C.  to  be  impleaded  as  a  party  in  the  said 

petitions.  The  Settlement  Agreement  also  obligated  Rubina  to  make  a 

statement  recognizing  her  brothers  as  the  sole  owners  and  landlords  of 

Property  No.1.  For  the  purposes  of  clarity,  paragraph  6(iii)  of  the  said 

Agreement is reproduced herein below:- 

“iii.  That she will withdraw all her objections and applications filed 
under Order I Rule 10 of the C.P.C. or else, whatsoever in ejectment 
petitions titled Iqbal Shafique Siddiqi VS Aqueel Hassan and others 
and Javaid Shafique Siddiqi VS MCR (Pvt.) Ltd. both pending in the 
court of Mr. Salman Badar, Rent Controller, Islamabad both fixed for 
21-09-2016 and be out of it. She will also make all out efforts and 
give a statement herself or through counsels in favour of the 
Petitioners recognizing them to be the sole owners and claimants 
and  landlords,  of  the  commercial  building  by  submitting 
applications and doing the needful, whatever, is required.” 

36.  Rubina’s recognition of her brothers as the sole owners of Property 

No.1  leaves  no  doubt  that  as  a  result  of  the  Settlement  Agreement,  she 

was left with no share in Property No.1.  

37.  Rubina,  through  her  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.,  has 

sought  the  setting-aside  of  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017 

only  to the extent  whereby  her  share  in  Property  No.1  inherited  from  her 

mother stood surrendered in favour of Javaid. Rubina asserts that the said 

decree  was  obtained  through  fraud,  misrepresentation  and  concealment 

of  material  facts.  The  grounds  taken  by  Rubina,  in  her  application  under 

Section  12(2)  C.P.C.,  do  not  mention  the  particulars  of  fraud  or 

misrepresentation.  

38.  She has pleaded that the Settlement Agreement could not have been 

interpreted  such  as  to  result  in  the  surrender  of  Rubina’s  share  in 

Property No.1. Furthermore, it has been pleaded that the receipt of Rs.25 

million  by  Rubina  was  in  consideration  of  “past deprivations, unjust 

treatment and embezzlements”  by  her brothers  and  could  not be treated 

as consideration for her share in Property No.1. These grounds pertain to 

the  merits  of  the  case  which  cannot  be  reopened  through  an  application 

under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  It  is  well  settled  that  a  decree  cannot  be 

challenged  on  merits  by  filing  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C., 

which  was  limited  in  scope  and  could  be  invoked  for  setting-aside  a 

 
 
 
 
 
15 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

decree on  the ground  of fraud,  misrepresentation or want  of jurisdiction. 

A  Court,  while  dealing  with  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C., 

cannot sit as a Court of appeal but has to see whether the order, judgment 

or decree has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation or passed by a 

Court having no jurisdiction over the matter. Reference in this regard may 

be made to the law laid down in the cases of Sardar Khan VS Muhammad 

Idrees  (PLD  2008  SC  591),  Province  of  Punjab  VS  Muhammad  Rashid 

(1988  MLD  2560),  and  Office  Incharge,  Market  Committee  VS  Arsalah 

Khan Brothers (2004 CLC 1427).  

39.  Rubina,  in  her  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C,  has  also 

pleaded  that her brothers,  in  connivance  with  her counsel  Bashir  Ahmad 

Chaudhary, Advocate, had defrauded her as well as the Court by giving a 

wrong interpretation to the Settlement Agreement. She has asserted that 

her  signature  on  the  reply  to  Shahnaz’s  application  under  Section  12(2) 

was  forged.  Even  if  it  is  assumed  that  the  reply  to  Shahnaz’s  application 

under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  had  not  been  filed  on  Rubina’s  instruction  or 

that  Rubina’s  signature  on  the  said  reply  was  forged,  this  fact  does  not 

have any bearing on the question whether the judgment and decree dated 

08.02.2017  was  procured  by  exercising  fraud  or  misrepresentation.  This 

is  because  the  said  reply  was  filed  on  19.10.2017  which  is  more  than 

seven months after the passing of the said judgment and decree. An event 

subsequent  to  the  passing  of  the  judgment  and  decree  cannot  be  made 

the basis for challenging it under Section 12(2) C.P.C.  

40.  After the statement of the learned counsel for Rubina was recorded 

by the learned Civil Court, it did not straight away decree suit No.154/2016 

instituted  by  Javaid  but  adjourned  the  matter  for  further  proceedings 

since  the  other  defendants  in  the  said  suit  had  to  be  heard.  It  is  not 

disputed that  the learned Civil  Court  also recorded  the statements  of the 

learned  counsel  for  Shafique  A.  Siddiqui  (defendant  No.2),  Pervaiz 

(defendant  No.4)  and  Gulnar  (defendant  No.7).  As  regards 

Iqbal 

(defendant  No.5)  and  Shahnaz  (defendant  No.6),  they  were  proceeded 

against  ex-parte  after  resorting  to  substituted  service  of  summons 

through  publication.  The  learned  Trial  Court  proceeded  cautiously  by 

framing  issues  and  recording  evidence.  It  was  not  until  08.02.2017  that 

 
 
 
 
16 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

suit  No.154/2016  was  decreed.  As  regards  Rubina  /  defendant  No.3  and 

defendants  No.2,  4  and  7  in  suit  No.154/2016,  the  said  decree  would  be 

treated  as  a  consent  decree  since  it  was  based  on  the  conceding 

statements of the learned counsel for the said defendants. It is well settled 

that a consent decree cannot be challenged in an appeal. It is only where 

such  a  decree  is  obtained  due  to  fraud  having  been  played  on  the  Court 

that  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  can  be  filed.  It  is  apposite  at  this 

stage to refer to the following case law:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Abdul  Hakim  VS  Shamim  Mushtaq  (1986  CLC  2611), 

the position taken by the applicant in his application  under Section 

12(2) C.P.C. was that the compromise deed between the parties had 

entitled the respondent to 25 acres but under the decree passed by 

the  Court  he  received  100  acres.  The  compromise  deed  had  been 

filed in the Court along with an application under Order XXIII, Rule 3 

C.P.C.  The  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh  took  the  view  that  these 

allegations  did  not  make  up  a  case  for  fraud  or  misrepresentation, 

and  that  the  terms  of  the  settlement  between  the  parties  were 

mentioned  in  the  application  under  Order  XXIII,  Rule  3  C.P.C. 

Furthermore, it was held that since a consent decree was passed on 

the  basis  of  the  said  application,  it  cannot  be  held  that  the  decree 

was without jurisdiction.  

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Munir  Ahmed  VS  Anwaar  ul  Haq  (2020 

YLR 232), it was held inter alia that a party that takes a benefit under 

a consent decree of the Civil Court by executing it in his favour does 

not  have  a  lawful  justification  to  create  hurdles  in  the  way  of  the 

other party to get benefits under the same decree. The conduct of a 

party to question a decree under which he had obtained benefit was 

termed as shameful and reprehensible.  

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Mazhar  Majid  VS  Ather  Majid  (2021  YLR  651),  a 

consent  decree  based  on  a  compromise  was  challenged  by  one  of 

the parties to the compromise through an application under Section 

12(2) C.P.C. The appeal against the dismissal of the said application 

was dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court of Sindh with the following 

observations:-  

 
 
 
 
17 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

“It is a settled proposition of law that decrees obtained on the basis 
of consent/compromise are not challengeable until and unless the 
same  are  proved  to  be  obtained  by  way  of  fraud  and 
misrepresentation. In the instant case, as noted above, no occasion 
either of playing fraud or that of misrepresentation has been pointed 
out as, firstly, the case was duly represented by the attorney of the 
appellant and, secondly, how could there be an occasion of playing 
fraud when all the parties have entered into a compromise by filing a 
proper application and then duly appearing before the learned 
Single Judge in support of their compromise application. In the 
instant case it is not even remotely suggested that the attorney 
appearing for the appellant and entering into a compromise in any 
way not his attorney or there were some motivation of fraud or 
misrepresentation by him so as to prefer the application under 
section 12(2), C.P.C. Neither it has been proved that the contents of 
the application were unlawful or void nor was it proved that the said 
application in any way lacks legal sanctity. For application under 
section 12(2), C.P.C. the onus heavily lies upon a person filing the 
said application that the order of the Court has been obtained by 
way of fraud or misrepresentation, which onus as seen from the 
impugned order and from the record, is totally lacking. The aspect 
of entering into the compromise due to pressure being exerted from 
other side also appears to be not borne out from the record. Is the 
appellant so naive not to take care of his legal rights to adopt the 
legal procedure in accordance with law against the other party as 
available to him.” 
(Emphasis added) 

41.  Given the facts and circumstances of this case, I am of the view that 

the  filing  of  the  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  was  motivated  by 

Rubina’s regret in  executing the  Settlement Agreement,  withdrawing suit 

No.458/2015 and agreeing to suit No.154/2016 being decreed. This, in my 

view, is nothing but sheer abuse of the process of the Court. The learned 

counsel  for  Rubina  was  candid  in  his  submission  that  the  present-day 

value of Rubina’s share in Property No.1 is much more than what was paid 

to her under the Settlement Agreement.  In paragraph 7 of the Settlement 

Agreement  Rubina  had  undertaken  “to  be  available  to  support  her 

brothers always and every time before all relevant forums including but 

not limited  to CDA  and  else in  regards with  transfer  or  any  other 

proceedings regarding commercial property at Islamabad.”   Instead  of 

fulfilling her undertaking, Rubina has embroiled her brothers in vexatious 

and wasteful litigation.  

42.  The  scope  and  application  of  Section  12(2)  cannot  be  extended 

beyond  the  grounds  of  fraud,  misrepresentation  and  the  defect  of 

jurisdiction enumerated therein. The misuse to which Section 12(2) C.P.C. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
18 

                  W.P.No.1412/2020 

has  been  subjected  to  by  unscrupulous  litigants  could  not  have  been 

explained in terms better than by the Hon'ble Mr. Justice M. Shaiq Usmani 

(as he then was) while speaking for the Hon'ble High Court of Sindh in the 

case  of  Izzat  Khan  VS  Province  of  Sindh  (1999  YLR  1180).  In  the  said 

case, it was held as follows:- 

“The intention of the legislature in introducing this amendment was to 
prevent unnecessary litigations arising from concluded legal proceedings. 
But instead of having the desired effect, I am constrained to observe this 
provision has led to an increase in litigations inasmuch as almost every 
other decree is now being challenged under this provision either directly 
by one of the patties or through a proxy. Such was obviously not the 
intention of legislature when this provision was introduced. Indeed the 
current practice is a mockery of the laudable objectives for which the 
provision came into effect. There is no doubt, that a decree of a Court 
must have sanctity once it has obtained finality even though such a decree 
may be ex parte or a compromise decree and it is only when there is fraud 
and mis-representation  on  the  face  of  the  record  so  apparent  and 
manifest that even a person with a rudimentary knowledge of law would 
be able to observe that such fraud has taken place that the application 
under section 12(2) should be allowed to proceed further. In fact what I 
wish to emphasize is that this ingredient of the provision must be very 
strictly construed.” 

43.  The amici curiae came up with well researched material on the case 

but  the  thrust  of  their  conclusion  was  that  an  unconscionable  bargain 

should  not  be  permitted  to  deprive  a  woman  of  her  inheritance  rights.  In 

the  case  at  hand  Rubina,  in  her  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C., 

has  not  asserted  that  the  Settlement  Agreement  was  unconscionable  or 

that she was coerced to enter into the same. Rubina is not a down-trodden 

illiterate woman who could not appreciate the import and meaning of the 

agreement  that  she  was  signing.  She  is  an  educated  woman  who,  two 

years  and  nine  months  after  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  08.02.2017, 

filed  the  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  in  an  effort  to  undo  the 

consequences of the Settlement Agreement. One of the consequences of 

the  said  Agreement  was  the  withdrawal  of  suit  No.458/2015  and  her 

consent  to suit No.154/2016 being  decreed.  She  had  admittedly  received 

Rs.25 million from her brothers by virtue of the said Agreement. True, the 

value  of  her  share  from  her  mother’s  1/3rd  share  in  Property  No.1  may 

have  increased  in  the  three  years  and  two  months  after  the  execution  of 

the  Settlement  Agreement  but  this  appreciation  in  the  value  of  the  said 

property  cannot  become  a  valid  cause for holding  that  the  judgment  and

decree  dated  08.02.2017  passed  in  suit  No.154/2016  had  been  obtained 

by fraud. 

44.  Finding  the  instant  writ  petition  not  just  to  be  bereft  of  merit  but 

sheer abuse of the process of the Court, the same is dismissed with costs 

throughout.
