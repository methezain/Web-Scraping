petitioner. 
Muhammad  Abdul  Rafeh,  Advocate  for  the 
respondents No. 2 & 3.   

Through  the  instant  petition  filed 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of 

Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  the  petitioner 

has  impugned  order  dated  21.04.2021, 

passed  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court  / 

Guardian Judge, West-Islamabad, whereby, 

interim maintenance allowance of the minor 

was  fixed  at  the  rate  of  Rs.15,000/-  per 

month  which  is  to  be  paid  since  January, 

2020.   

02.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter  alia,  contends 

that 

interim 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 1791 of 2021 

maintenance  has  not  been  fixed  according 

to  financial  status  of  the  petitioner;  the 

impugned order is against the law and facts 

of  the  case  and  is  not  sustainable  in  the 

eyes of law; the impugned order passed in 

a  hasty  manner;  learned  trial  Court  fixed 

the  monthly  maintenance  allowance  of 

minor 

from 

January, 

2020  without 

considering  the  facts  of  case,  whereas  the 

suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  was  filed 

on  22.04.2020,  hence  the  impugned  order 

is liable to be set-aside.  

03.  Learned counsel for respondents No.2 

&  3  has  controverted  the  arguments  made 

by  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and 

stated  that  impugned  order  was  passed  in 

accordance with law; the petitioner / father 

of  respondent  No.3 

is  bound  to  pay 

maintenance  to  the  minor,  hence  instant 

writ petition is liable to be dismissed.  

04.  Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard 

and  record  has  been  perused  with  their

able assistance. 

05.  The  petitioner  has  challenged  the 

interim  order  for  fixation  of  maintenance 

allowance  of  minor  aged  about  five  (05) 

years.  

06. 

It  is  mentioned  in  Section  14(3)  of 

the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 

that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie 

against an interim order passed 

by a Family Court”. 

07.  According  to  law,  father  is  bound  to 

pay maintenance of the minor. Learned trial 

Court  has 

jurisdiction 

to 

fix 

interim 

maintenance of the minor according to law.  

08. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled 

as  Syed  Saghir  Ahmad  Naqvi  VS 

Province of Sindh (1996 SCMR 1165), 

that: 

“The statute excluding a right of 

appeal  from  the  interim  order 

cannot  be  passed  by  bringing 

under attack such interim orders in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 1791 of 2021 

Constitutional  jurisdiction.  The 

party affected has to wait till it 

matures into a final order and then 

to attack it in the proper exclusive 

forum created for the purpose of 

examining such orders.” 

 Reliance  is  also  placed  on  the  cases 

reported  as  1976 SCMR 450  and  2020 

SCMR 260. 

09.  Learned counsel for the petitioner has 

failed to point out as to how the impugned 

/ interim order passed by the learned Judge 

Family  Court  /  Guardian  Judge,  West-

Islamabad was the consequence of an error 

of law or without jurisdiction or in excess of 

jurisdiction.  

10. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective, 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed.
