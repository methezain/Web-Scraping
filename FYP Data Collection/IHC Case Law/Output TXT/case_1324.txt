Ch. Bilal Yousaf, Advocate for respondents 1 to 5. 

Through  instant  writ  petition,  petitioner 

impugns order dated 27.01.2021, passed by the 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-II/Judge  Family 

Court, Islamabad-East, which reads as under:- 

“  RanaAamir Sultan Advocate filed his WN 
for D.2. He also cross-examined the PWs. 

interim 
  Regarding  payment  of 
maintenance to the minor as directed vide 
order dated 22.12.2021, he contended that in 
this  order  only  D.1  was  directed  to  pay 
interim maintenance and there was no order 
regarding payment of maintenance to the 
D.2. It may be observed that D.2 is paternal 
grandfather  of  the  minors  and  is  equally 
responsible to maintain the minors as the 
D.1. It is, therefore, ordered that D.2 shall 
pay the interim maintenance to the minors in 
case of failure by D.1 to maintain his children. 
As such, D.2 is also directed to clear all 
outstanding amount of maintenance by next 
date before making further proceedings in the 
case.  

  Adj. to 16-02-2021 for evidence of def. 
No.2.”

2.  Essential  and  relevant  facts  for  adjudication 

of instant writ petition are that respondents 1 to 

5  filed  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  and 

dowry  articles  besides  gold  ornaments  against 

Muhammad  Ameen  and  petitioner  (father  & 

grandfather of respondents 2 to 5).  Said  Muhammad 

Ameen,  arrayed  as  defendant  No.1,  was 

proceeded  against  ex-parte  while  petitioner 

contested  the  suit  by  filing  written  statement. 

The learned Trial Court framed necessary issues 

and  then  passed  the  order,  being  impugned 

through instant writ petition. 

3.   

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

contends  that  monthly  income  of  the  petitioner 

is  just  Rs.11000/-  per  month  in  terms  of  his 

pension,  while  he  owns  only  five  marla  land; 

that  actually  sons  of  the  petitioner  owns  four 

houses and name of the petitioner is only meant 

for  connection  of  utility  meters,  therefore, 

impugned  order  is  liable  to  be  set  aside. 

Learned counsel placed reliance upon case laws 

reported as  PLD  2012  Lahore  445  and  2020  CLC 

131 (Islamabad). 

4.   

On the other hand, learned counsel for 

respondents  2  to  5  argued  that  petitioner  and 

his sons  are running a joint business; that their 

monthly income is about Rs.1,70,000/- and that 

a  vague  stance  has  been  taken  just  to  avoid 

liability,  therefore,  petition  is  liable  to  be 

dismissed. Learned counsel refers 2004 YLR 616

5.   

6.   

Heard, record perused.  

 At  the  very  outset,  it  is  necessary  to 

mention that the impugned order, on the face of 

it,  isan  interim  order  where  against  remedy  of 

appeal  or  revision  is  barred  in  terms  of  Section 

14 of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964 

(Act of 1964) which readsas under:- 

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 
an interim order passed by a Family 
Court.” 

7.  The  Act  of  1964,  being  a  special  law, 

explicitly  bars  remedy  of  appeal  or  revision 

against interim order, therefore, when a statute 

specifically excludes a remedy, petition in terms 

of Article 199 of the Constitution cannot be held 

to  be  maintainable  against  the  said  order  as  it 

would amount to circumvent the intention of the 

legislature and frustrate the express provision of 

law.  In  “Dr.  SaminaAnayat  v.  Additional 

District  Judge  and  others”  (2018  MLD  448 

Lahore),the  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court  was  of 

the view that:- 

“Perusal of section 14(3) of West Pakistan 
Family Court Act, 1964, shows that no appeal 
or revision shall lie against an interim order 
passed  by  a  Family  Court.  The  Act  has 
explicitly  barred  the  remedy  of  appeal  or 
revision against such an order, therefore, in 
case a constitutional petition is entertained 
against  such  an  order,  it  will  amount  to 

 
 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 676 of 2021 

                                         -4- 

circumvent the intention of the legislation and 
to  frustrate  the  express  provision  of  law. 
Reliance  in  this  respect  is  placed  upon 
Muhammad Anwar Khan v. Mst. YasminZafar 
(1987 SCMR 2029), Ms. QuratulainAleem v. 
Muhammad Rehman Khan and another (2006 
YLR 2604) and Mst. Noor Jehan alias Tasleem 
Begum v. Muhammad Arshad and another 
(1986 CLC 442). Since the impugned order is 
an interlocutory order and against such an 
order  constitution  petition  cannot  be  filed, 
therefore, the petition before this Court is not 
maintainable. The learned Additional District 
Judge has rightly observed in the appeal that 
appeal  or  revision  against  interlocutory 
matters is not maintainable.” 

8.  Moreover,  the  questions  as  to  whether 

petitioner  being  grandfather 

is 

jointly  and 

severally  liable  to  maintain  minors/respondents 

2 to 5, is a man of means or is only dependent 

upon meager amount of monthly pension, are to 

be  decided  after  recording  evidence,  pro and 

contra,  where  both  the  sides  will  have  right  to 

adduce 

their 

respective  oral  as  well  as 

documentary evidence.  

9.        The jurisdiction in terms of Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  cannot  be  invoked  to  assail  an 

interim  order  in  an  issue,  totally  dependent 

upon  recording  of  evidence.  The  proceedings, 

being  conducted  by  the  learned  Trial  Court, 

would,  of  course,  be  culminated  through  final 

judgment and in that eventuality both the sides 

will  have  a  right  of  appeal  as  per  law.  Thus, 

where 

statutory 

remedy 

is 

provided, 

 
 
 
 
Writ Petition No. 676 of 2021 

                                         -5- 

constitutional jurisdiction cannot be pressed into 

service.  

10. 

In  view  of  above,  it  is  held  that  the 

instant  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable  and 

lacks  merits,  consequently,  dismissed.  Ad-

interim relief granted to the petitioner vide order 

dated 18.02.2021 is recalled.
