Proceedings 
14.07.2021  Malik  Khalid  Mansoor,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  order  dated 

10.12.2020,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II  /  Judge  Family-Guardian  Court, 

East-Islamabad,  whereby  CNIC  of 

the 

petitioner has been impounded. 

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends 

that 

judgment  and 

decree was passed against the petitioner for 

payment  of  the  maintenance  of  minors  on 

14.11.2014.  Thereafter,  the  petitioner  was 

regularly  paying  maintenance  to  the  minors 

and  the  impugned  order  is  erroneous  and  is 

not tenable under the law as due to passing 

of said order valuable rights of the petitioner 

have  been  jeopardized  and  he  is  suffering 

from  irreparable  loss,  hence  the  impugned 

order is liable to be set-aside.
