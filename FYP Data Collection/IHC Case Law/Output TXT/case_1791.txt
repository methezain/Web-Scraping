and due to strained relationship  she was forced to file suit for dissolution  of
marriage by way ol khullain which  she recorded her statement  on 02'01"2018 in

record her stance  in a proper  manner and passed  the decree  fot khulla subiect  to

both the Courts below  have not considered this aspect in proper  manner; that

her medical condition  she was not able to understand  the effect of the statement

which  was incorrectlY  recorded'
3.  Conversely,  leaned counsql for respondent No'1  contends that statement
recorded  by the trial Court is ciear as the same  was recorded in presence of
petitioner's  counsel  and no mistake  was colnmitted by any of the parties  and the
same  was correctly  understood by the Court concerned  and at this stage  no

somersault  is permissible under the law'

5. 
with respondent  No.L on 13.11,.2016 in accordance with Muslim rites  and
ceremonies  against the dower  of Rs.50,0OO/-,  however'  petitioner  subsequently
filed suit for dissolution  of marriage on the basis of khulla, whereby reconciliation
effort in the Family Court failed and parties were directed  to appear  before  the

)udge  Family Court and to record  their statements'

6.ThestatementofpetitionerandrespondentNo.lwasrecordedon
02.01..2018,  whereby petitioner claimed  the decree of khulta  and has also
acknowledged that she has received  the dower  amount in shape  of gold jewelry'
The  said statement  was recorded in presence  of her counsel  and she signed  the
statement  and put her thumb impression'  In view of the said statement  learned
]udge Family Court  has passed the decree dated  02'01'2018  and considered  the
admission on the part of petitioner as valid  acknowledgment  of receiving  dower
and grant ed.khullain  terms  of Section  10(a) of the Family  Court Act'1964  subiect
to zare-khulla  of.Rs.50,000/-  in shape of gold jewelry referred in column No'13 of

thenikkahnama.

The petitioner has challenged  the said order before leaned Additional
7. 
District Judge (East), Islamabad in appeal which was dismissed being time
barred vide judgment & decrep  dated 06.12.2018, as such concurrent  findings  of

W.P No.42812019

3

fact recorded by the Courts  below on the basis of admission  on the part of

petitioner  by way of her statemerit  is duly acknowledged by both the Courts and

no illegality  has been observed in the said proceedings.

8. 

The plea raised  by the petiftioner  qua her health and medical condition at

JLI

the time of recording of her statdment  is not justified.  It is trite law that dower

which  was received at the time of nikknh  has to be returned in case of khulla in

terms  of Section 10(a)  of the Family  Court  Act,1964,  therefore, instant petition is

misconceived  and the same is herdby ilismissed.
