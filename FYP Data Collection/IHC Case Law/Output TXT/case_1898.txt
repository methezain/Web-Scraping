Proceedings 
16.11.2017  Mr. Ijaz Janjua, Advocate for the appellants, 

Respondent No.1 in-person. 

 Through  the  instant  intra  court  appeal,  the 

appellants, 

impugn 

the 

judgment 

dated 

21.09.2017,  passed  by  the  learned  Single  Judge 

in-Chambers,  in  writ  petition  No.76/2017  titled 

“Najm-us-Saquib  VS  Minhaaj  Saqib  etc.”  only  to 

the  extent  of  the  modification  made  in  the  order 

dated  14.11.2016,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court, 

Islamabad,  by  reducing 

the 

quantum  of  interim  maintenance  to  which  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad,  held 

each  of  appellants  No.2  and  3  entitled  to,  from 

Rs.50,000/- to Rs.25,000/- per month. The learned 

Single  Judge-in-Chambers  made 

the  said 

modification  after  holding  the  said  writ  petition 

was not maintainable.  

2. 

The  facts  essential  for  the  disposal  of  this 

appeal  are that appellant  No.3 (Saima Malik) and 

respondent  No.1  (Najam-us-Saqib)  got  married 

on  25.07.1989.  The  couple  were  blessed  with 

three children, namely, appellant No.2 (Ms. Sehar 

Saqib,  who  was  born  on  08.07.1990),  Ms.  Myra 

Saqib,  who  was  born  on  21.11.1991,  and 

appellant  No.1  (Minhaaj  Saqib,  who  was  born  on 

20.10.2001). Subsequently, the relations between 

the  couple  turned  sour  resulting  in  their  divorce 

on 28.04.2011. Appellants No.1 and 2 are in their 

custody of their mother/appellant No.3.

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

3.  On  21.06.2012,  respondent  No.1  filed  a 

petition  under  Section  25  of  the  Guardians  and 

Wards  Act,  1890,  for  obtaining  appellant  No.1’s 

custody.  Vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

06.01.2015, 

the 

learned  Guardian 

Judge 

dismissed the said petition. However, a visitation 

schedule  for  meetings  between  appellant  No.1 

and  respondent  No.1  was  fixed  by  the  learned 

Guardian  Judge.  Since  respondent  No.1  was 

posted  abroad,  the  learned  appellate  Court  vide 

judgment  dated  09.05.2015  modified 

the 

visitation  schedule  with  the  consent  of  appellant 

No.3.  

4.  On 12.02.2016, the appellants filed a suit for 

maintenance for appellants No.1 and 2 before the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  Islamabad.  The 

details  of  appellants  No.1  and  2  expenses  were 

mentioned  in  the  suit.  Appellant  No.1  was  then  a 

student  at 

the  Lahore  Grammar  School, 

Islamabad,  whereas  appellant  No.2  was  doing 

her  L.L.M.  at  George  Washington  University, 

Washington D.C. In the said suit, a claim for past 

maintenance  was  also  made.  Respondent  No.1 

contested  the  said  petition  by  filing  a  written 

statement.  Vide  order  dated  14.11.2016,  the 

learned Judge Family Court, fixed Rs.50,000/- per 

month  as 

interim  maintenance 

for  each  of 

appellants  No.1  and  2.  The  said  order  dated 

14.11.2016,  which  was  interim  in  nature,  was 

assailed  by  respondent  No.1  in  writ  petition 

No.76/2016  before  this  Court.  Vide  judgment 

dated  21.09.2017,  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-

Chambers held that the said writ petition was not 

maintainable. Nonetheless, he interfered with the 

interim  order  dated  14.11.2016  by  reducing  the 

interim  maintenance  for  each  of  appellants  No.1 

3 

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

and  2  from  Rs.50,000/-  to  Rs.25,000/-  per  month. 

The  said  judgment  dated  21.09.2017  has  been 

impugned  by  the  appellants  only  to  the  extent  of 

the  modification  made  in  the  quantum  of  interim 

maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court.  

5. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the  appellants 

submitted  that  the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-

Chambers  was  correct  in  holding  that  a  writ 

petition  against  an  interim  order  passed  by  the 

learned 

Judge 

Family  Court  was 

not 

maintainable;  that  the  said  finding  of  the  learned 

Single  Judge-in-Chambers  was  in  consonance 

with  the  well  settled  principle  that 

interim 

maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court could not be assailed in a writ petition; that 

after  holding  that  the  writ  petition  instituted  by 

respondent  No.1  was  not  maintainable,  the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers  could  not 

have 

interfered  with 

the  said  order  dated 

14.11.2016  by  reducing  the  interim  maintenance 

for  appellants  No.1  and  2  fixed  by  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court;  that  there  was  a  material 

contradiction  in  the  judgment  dated  21.09.2017, 

passed  by 

the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-

Chambers;  and  that  respondent  No.1  could  not 

avoid his obligation of adequately maintaining his 

own children. Learned counsel for the appellants 

prayed  for  the  judgment  dated  21.09.2017  to  be 

set-aside only to the extent of interference shown 

with  the  quantum  of  maintenance  fixed  by  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  for  appellants  No.1 

and 2.  

6.  On 

the  other  hand,  respondent  No.1 

appeared  in-person  and  submitted  that  he  was 

currently  serving  as  Pakistan’s  Ambassador  to 

4 

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

Brazil;  that  respondent  No.1’s  salary  did  not 

enable  him  to  pay  interim  maintenance  in  the 

amount  fixed  by  the learned  Judge  Family  Court; 

that  respondent  No.1  draws  a  monthly  salary  of 

Rs.2,00,391/-  only;  and  that  the  modification 

made by the learned Single Judge-in-Chambers in 

the  interim  maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  was 

just  and  proper. 

Respondent  No.1  prayed  for  the  appeal  to  be 

dismissed.   

7.  We  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  as  well  as 

respondent No.1. The facts leading to the filing of 

the  appeal  are  set  out  in  sufficient  details  in 

paragraphs  2  to  4  above,  and  need  not  be 

recapitulated.  

8. 

In writ petition No.76/2016, respondent No.1 

had 

impugned 

the 

interim  order  dated 

14.11.2016,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  Islamabad,  whereby  interim  maintenance 

at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month was fixed for 

each  of  appellants  No.1  and  2.  Vide  judgment 

dated  21.09.2017,  the  learned  Single  Judge-in-

Chambers held that the said writ petition was not 

maintainable.  Paragraph  6  and  a  part  of 

paragraph 7 of the said judgment are reproduced 

herein below:- 

“6.  I have gone through the pleadings of the 
parties as well as order passed by learned 
Family Judge. Although it is well settled that 
interim  maintenance  could  not  be  assailed 
through a writ petition. Reliance is placed upon 
2017 YLR 622 Islamabad titled as Shahida Fazil 
VS  Mst.  Hina  Tahir,  etc.,  2014  CLC  330 
Islamabad titled as Mst. Maham Shabbir VS 
Salman Haider and others 2015 MLD 840 titled 
as Shah Ameer Mujtaba VS XX Civil and Family 
Judge and 3 others. 
7. In view of above, instant writ petition is not 
maintainable. …” 

 
5 

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

9.  After holding that the writ petition instituted 

by  respondent  No.1  was  not  maintainable,  the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers 

interfered 

with  interim  order  dated  14.11.2016,  passed  by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  by  reducing  the 

quantum  of  maintenance  for  each  of  appellants 

No.1  and  2  from  Rs.50,000/-  to  Rs.25,000/-  per 

month.  We  are  of  the  view  that  once  it  was  held 

that  the  writ  petition  was  not  maintainable,  the 

learned  Single  Judge-in-Chambers  ought  not  to 

have gone into the merits of the case by reducing 

the  interim  maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court.  When  a  Court  holds  that  a 

writ petition is not maintainable, then it should not 

give  any  finding  on  merits  or  interfere  with  the 

order assailed in the writ petition.  

10.  There  is  a  catena  of  case  law  in  support  of 

the  proposition  that  where  an  objection  to  the 

maintainability of a lis or to the jurisdiction of the 

Court to adjudicate upon the matter is taken, the 

same ought to be decided before an adjudication 

on  merits.  In  the  case  of  Chief  Executive  FESCO 

Ltd.  VS  Additional  District  and  Sessions  Judge, 

Sargodha  (PLD  2005  Lahore  709),  it  has  been 

held  that “it is obligatory rather mandatory for a 

Court in the first instance to satisfy itself about 

the existence of its jurisdiction and power to 

decide  the  matter  brought  before  it.”  The 

rationale  for  this  is  that  in  the  event,  the  Court 

finds  that  the  lis  is  not  maintainable  or  that  the 

Court does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate 

upon  the  matter,  there  would  be  no  occasion  for 

the Court to delve into or give any findings on the 

merits of the case, let alone interference with the 

order under challenge.  

6 

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

11.  Once  a  petition 

is  held  not 

to  be 

maintainable,  the  Court,  in  effect,  holds  that  it 

does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon 

the lis. In the case of Muhammad Naeem Kasi VS 

Abdul  Latif  (2005  SCMR  1699),  it  has  been  held 

that  the  word  “jurisdiction”  means  the  power  to 

hear  and  decide 

legal  controversy  between 

parties 

to  pronounce 

judgment  as  per 

requirement  of  law.  After  the  Court  holds  that 

petition  before 

it 

is  not  maintainable,  any 

interference  with  order 

impugned 

in  such  a 

petition  or  determination  of  the  lis  on  merits, 

would  be  without  jurisdiction  and  liable  to  be 

declared  as  such.  Reference  may  be  also  be 

made to the following case law:- 

i) 

In  the  case  of  S.M.  Waseem  Ashraf  VS 

Federation  of  Pakistan  through  Secretary, 

Ministry  of  Housing  &  Works  and  others 

(2013 SCMR 338), it has been held inter-alia 

that  "any  forum  or  court,  which,  if  lacks 

jurisdiction  adjudicates  and  decides  a 

matter, such decision etc. shall be void and 

of no legal effect."  

ii) 

In  the  case  of  Humayun  Saifullah  Khan  VS 

Federation  of  Pakistan  (PLD  1990  SC  599), 

it has been held inter-alia that where the bar 

of  jurisdiction  had  not  been  crossed,  no 

adjudication  on  merits  in  the  nature  of  a 

substantive finding could be recorded. 

iii) 

In  the  case  of  Yousuf  A.  Haroon  VS 

Custodian  of  the  Karachi  Hotel  Project 

(2004 CLC 1967), it has been held inter-alia 

that  while  disposing  of  a  petition  on  the 

point  of  jurisdiction  and  non-maintainability 

of  the  petition,  it  would  not  be  proper  to 

make  any  observation  on  the  merits  of  the 

7 

I.C.A.No.316/2017 

case  and  on  any  point  of  law  other  than 

maintainability of the petition as it was likely 

to  effect  the proceedings  which the parties 

may pursue. 

iv) 

In  the  case  of  Messrs  Voyage  de  Air, 

General  Sales  Agent,  Shaheen  Air 

International  VS  Shaheen  Air  International 

Pvt.  Ltd.  (2006  CLC  173),  the  Hon'ble 

Lahore High Court has held as follows:   

 “15. It is settled preposition of law that 
where the Courts having no jurisdiction 
over subject-matter of suit or appeal, it 
cannot decide any question on merits. It 
can simply decide question of jurisdiction 
and  order  return  of  plaint  for  its 
presentation to proper Court if it comes to 
conclusion  that  it  has  no  jurisdiction. 
Reference in this context can be made to 
the  cases  of  Athmanathaswami 
Devasthanam  v.  K.  Gopalaswami 
Ayyangar  AIR  1965  SC  338;  Karachi 
Electric  Supply  Corporation  Limited 
through Secretary v. Messrs Haji Hashim 
Haji  Ahmad  Brothers  2003  YLR  2226; 
Maqsood Ali Khan v. National Bank of 
Pakistan through President, Head Office, 
I.I.  Chundrigar  Road,  Karachi  and  3 
others 2003 PLC (C.S.) 226; and Shah v. 
Bibi Bushra and others 1992 MLD 833.” 

12. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  appeal  is 

allowed  and 

the 

impugned  order  dated 

21.09.2017  is  set-aside  only  to  the  extent  of 

modification  made  in  the  interim  order  dated 

14.11.2016  by  reducing  the  interim  maintenance 

for  each  of  appellants  No.1  and  2 

from 

Rs.50,000/-  to  Rs.25,000/-  per  month.  There  shall 

be no order as to costs.
