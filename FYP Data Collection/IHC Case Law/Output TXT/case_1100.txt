 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

Kanals 2-Marlas land i.e. entire share of respondents No.12 and 

14  /  defendants  No.2  and  4  in  Khasra  No.2078  out  of  which 

some  part  has  also  been  transferred  to  the  nominees  of  the 

petitioners / plaintiffs, accordingly said respondents / defendants 

also surrendered their possession of shamlat land measuring 02-

Kanals 14-Marlas being their entire share in Khasra No.2107 and 

after  transfer  of  their  land  in  this  khasra  no  possession  in  this 

khasra  was  left  with  them.  It  is  contended  that  respondents 

No.12  and  14  /  defendants  No.2  and  4  also  handed  over  land 

measuring  03-Kanals  and  02-Marlas  out  of  khasra  No.2074  and 

transferred  their  entire  share  in  favour  of  petitioner  No.4  / 

plaintiff No.4 after receiving full consideration. The respondent / 

defendant No.1 (Zamir Khan) was also shown to be the sharer in 

the  revenue  record  but  as  per  his  family  settlement  he  had 

waived off his right of giving his consent.  

3. 

That the share of respondents / defendants No.2 to 

4  was  transferred  in  favour  of  petitioner  No.4  vide  sale  deed 

dated  12.10.1995.  It  is  asserted  that  the  petitioners  /  plaintiffs 

and  their  nominees  have  been  enjoying  peaceful  possession  of 

the  entire  aforesaid  land  for  the  last  five  /  six  years  and  have 

also constructed road, boundary walls and rooms etc. over it. It 

is  contended  that  although  petitioners  / plaintiffs  are  owners  of 

land as mentioned in para No.01 of the plaint, but presently the 

dispute  is  with  respect  to  khasra  numbers  2070,  2074,  2078, 

2080  and  land  about  4-Kanals  and  14-Marlas  of  khasra 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
          -3-   

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

Nos.3073/2107.  It  is  stated  that  the  respondents  /  defendants 

intend  to  transfer  the  land  to  some  other  persons  after  getting 

incorporating  their  names  in  the  revenue  record  through  fraud. 

They  have  been  threatened  to  dispossess  the  petitioners  by 

illegal means.  

4. 

During  the  pendency  of  suit,  after  obtaining  the 

permission  to  amend  the  plaint,  the  petitioners  /  plaintiffs 

contended in amended plaint that they  have been dispossessed 

by the respondents / defendants in violation of their legal rights. 

That  they  requested  them  not  to  tress-pass  there  and  /  or  to 

forcibly  occupy  it,  but  they  refused  hence  this  suit  with  the 

prayer  of  declaration,  recovery  of  possession,  mandatory 

injunction  with  the  direction  to  respondents  to  hand  over  the 

peaceful  possession  of  land  and  as  a  consequential  relief  a 

decree for permanent injunction was also prayed for.  

5. 

Respondents  /  defendants  contested  the  suit  by 

filing  written  statement  in  which  they  denied  the  ownership  as 

well as possession of petitioners as per their description given in 

the  plaint,  whereafter,  keeping  in  view  legal  as  well  as  factual 

controversies between the parties following issues were framed:- 

“Issues:- 

1.  Whether  the  plaintiffs  have  no  cause  of  action, 

hence suit is liable to be dismissed? OPD 

2.  Whether  the  suit  is  not  maintainable  in  its  present 

form? OPD 

3.  Whether the suit is bad or mis joinder of necessary 

parties, hence liable to be dismissed? OPD

frivolous,  hence  defendants  are  entitled  to  special 

costs? OPD 

5.  Whether the plaintiffs are co-owners / co-sharers in 

possession  of  the  suit  property  measuring  106- 

Kanals and 05-Marlas? OPP 

6.  Whether  the  defendants  No.2  to  4  in  connivance

prayed for? OPP

6. 

The  petitioners  /  plaintiffs  filed  a  petition  under 

Order XIV Rule  5(3)  read with Section 151 C.P.C. for amending 

issue  No.5  framed  on  30.06.2003  on  the  ground  that  in  the 

issues  already  framed,  the  suit  property  has  not  been  properly 

mentioned,  according  to  prayer  clause  of  the  suit,  the  suit 

property  is  mentioned  in  para  No.5  of  the  plaint,  hence  it  was 

prayed in the petition that by amending issue No.5, suit property 

mentioned in para No.05 of the plaint be mentioned in the said 

issue.  That  petition  was  accepted  and  learned  Trial  Court 

amended issue No.5 on 29.04.2005, as under:- 

“5.  Whether  the  plaintiff  is  owner  in  possession  as  co-
sharer  in  the  land  bearing  Khasra  Nos.2070,  2074, 
2078,  2080  and  about  04-Kanals,  14-Marlas  of  Khasra 
No.3073/2107? OPP” 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          -5-   

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

7. 

That  the  petitioners  were  directed  to  produce 

evidence  on  amended  issue  framed  but  no  fresh  evidence  was 

produced. The petitioners filed an amended plaint, wherein they 

claimed the recovery of possession of suit property besides other 

claims and issue No.5 was re-casted and amended issue No.5-A 

was framed on 05.01.2011, which is as under:- 

“5-A.  Whether  the  plaintiffs  have  been  dispossessed  by 
the  defendants  during  the  pendency  of  suit,  therefore, 
they are entitled to recovery of possession of the same? 
OPP”. 

8. 

That  after  framing  of  issue  No.5-A,  the  petitioners 

produced additional evidence, after hearing both the parties, the 

learned Trial Court dismissed the suit filed by the petitioners vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated  15.09.2011.  Being  aggrieved  the 

petitioners  filed  regular  first  appeal  under  Section  96  of  C.P.C., 

the same was also dismissed by the Court of learned Additional 

District  Judge  (IV),  East-Islamabad,  vide  judgment  and  decree 

dated 31.01.2014, hence the instant revision petition. 

9. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  inter-alia, 

contends that both the learned lower Courts have not given any 

finding on amended issue No.5, dated 29.04.2005. 

10. 

That 

the 

right  of  cross-examination  of 

the 

respondents was closed, the respondents have also not adduced 

the  affirmative  evidence,  hence  claim  of  the  petitioners  / 

plaintiffs had gone un-rebutted.

11. 

That  the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  of  the 

Courts  below  are  against  the  law  and  facts  and  same  are  not 

tenable  in  the  eye  of  law,  both  the  learned  lower  Courts  have 

ignored  the  important  aspect  that  previously  issue  No.5  was 

originally  framed  by  learned  Trial  Court  on  30.06.2003  but 

amended  on  29.04.2005  as  the  petitioners  /  plaintiffs  have 

adduced  their  affirmative  oral  as  well  as  documentary  evidence 

on  the  said  issue  but  the  said  primary  issue  has  never  been 

discussed  by  both  the  Courts  below,  by  passing  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  the  learned  lower  Courts  have  acted 

illegally and have committed irregularity. That the valuable rights 

of the petitioners are involved in the instant case and has prayed 

for setting aside of concurrent findings of both the Courts below, 

whereby suit filed by the petitioners was dismissed.   

12. 

Conversely, learned counsel for the respondents has 

controverted  the  arguments  made  by  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  by  stating  that  both  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  have  been  passed  according  to  law  laid  down  by 

superior  Courts  of  the  country  and  facts  of  the  case,  the 

concurrent findings are not liable to be set-aside by this Court, in 

the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  both  the  learned  lower 

Courts have discussed all the evidence and controversy between 

the parties and have rightly passed the impugned judgments and 

decrees by dismissing the suit of the petitioners and has prayed 

for dismissal of the instant revision petition.

13. 

Arguments  advanced  by  learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  have  been  heard  and  the  documents  placed  on  record 

have been examined with their able assistance. 

14. 

The  main  emphasis  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  is  on  the  point  that  both  the  learned  lower  Courts 

have not given any findings on issue No.5, which was amended 

on  29.04.2005  on  the  petition  filed  by  the  petitioners,  which  is 

reproduced as under:- 

“5.  Whether  the  plaintiff  is  owner  in  possession  as  co-
sharer  in  the  land  bearing  Khasra  Nos.2070,  2074, 
2078,  2080  and  about  04-Kanals,  14  Marlas  of  Khasra 
No.3073/2107? OPP”. 

15.  

Though in the impugned judgments and decrees the 

said  amended  issue  is  not  mentioned  but  the  controversy  / 

points  involved  in  the  issue  have  been  decided  by  the  learned 

Trial  Court  in  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree,  the  relevant 

portion is reproduced as under:- 

“In  para  No.01  of  the  plaint  they  have  claimed  their 
ownership  over  total  land  measuring  195-K,  11-M  and 
have  particularized  their  dispute  to  the  extent  of  land 
mentioned  in  para  No.5  of  the  plaint  i.e.  khasra 
No.2070, 2074, 2078, 2080 of land measuring 4-K, 14-M 
and  khasra  No.3073/2017.  That  admittedly  the  whole 
land i.e. Malkiyat as well as Shamlati was purchased by 
them  through  different  documents  /  agreements  from 
joint  Khatta  without  any  legal  demarcation.  While 
perusing 
the  documentary  evidence  produced  by 
plaintiffs  it  is  transpired  that  khasra  No.2074  is  a 
shamlati  khasra,  khasra  No.3073/2107  is  also  shamlati 
comprising  over  total  land  683-K,  18-M  and  plaintiffs 
have produced their titled document only to the extent of 
70-K  as  Ex-P.2  and  36-K  5-M  as  Ex.P.1.  Regarding 
Khasra  No.2078  there  is  a  general  power  of  attorney 
regarding  land  measuring  3-K,  2-M  Malkiyat  land  and 
iqrarnama  regarding  3-K  2-M  Malkiyeti  as  well  as  2-K 
14-M  in  shamlati  land,  but  neither  the  document  of 
Iqrarnama  nor  general  power  of  attorney  act  as  title 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          -8-   

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

documents. Regarding Khasra No.2071 and 2080, there 
is  no  title  document  produced  on  record.  In  view 
whereof there is no sufficient proof of title of property in 
dispute.  It  was  never  partitioned  legally,  therefore,  it 
cannot  be  said  with  certainty  that  they  were  ever  given 
the  possession  of  this  land  wherefrom  they  were 
dispossessed.  Despite 
is  no  supporting 
evidence of PW-2 who is a sole witness, therefore, I am 
not  convinced  to  grant  them  their  claim.  Resultantly, 
this issue is decided in negative.”  

there 

that 

16. 

As  the  issues  have  been  decided  by  discussing  all 

the  oral  and  documentary  evidence,  so  if  the  issue  was  not 

reproduced according to its wordings in the impugned judgment, 

no  prejudice  is  caused  to  the  petitioners  /  plaintiffs,  no 

irregularity  or  illegality  has  been  committed  by  the  learned 

Courts  below  while  passing  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees. 

17. 

In a case reported as “The Province of East Pakistan 

v. Major Nawab Khawaja Hasan Askary and others” (PLD 1971 

SC 82), it has been held that:  

“The parties have led evidence in support of their cases 
and it was on this evidence that decision has been given 
by  the  Courts  below.  In  my  opinion,  the  procedure 
adopted by the Courts below cannot be said to be illegal. 
If issues are not framed but allegations are made in the 
plaint and they are challenged in the written statement, 
it  is  open  to  the  Court  to  allow  the  parties  to  lead 
evidence on such point and to give decision on it without 
framing any issue.” 

18. 

In a case reported as “Fazal Muhammad Bhatti and 

another v. Mst. Saeeda Akhtar and 2 others” (1993  SCMR 

2018), it has also been held that:  

“It  was  held  by  this  Court  in  the  Province  of  East 
Pakistan  v.  Major  Nawab  Khawaja  Hasan  Askary  and 
others  (PLD  1971  SC  82)  that  if  issues  are  not  framed 
but allegations made in the plaint are challenged in the 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          -9-   

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

written statement and the Court has allowed evidence to 
be led, then a decision rendered without framing of the 
"issues is not illegal.” 

19. 

In  a  case  reported  as  “Mst. Saeeda Akhtar Sadiq 

through Special Attorney v. Tauqir Akhtar” (2006 CLC 1430), it 

has also been held that:  

“Where  the  parties  have  been  aware  of  the  points 
requiring  determination,  and  had  led  evidence  and  the 
matter  had  been  decided  by  the  Court,  in  that  case  the 
decision  rendered  by  the  Court  would  not  be  illegal. 
Reliance  in  this  context  can  be  placed  to  the  case  of 
Fazal  Muhammad  Bhatti  v.  Mst.  Saeeda  Akhtar  and  2 
others  1993  SCMR  2018  and  also  a  judgment  of  this 
Court in the case of Kaura and others v. Allah Ditta and 
others. 2000 CLC 1018; Mst. Sughra Bibi alias Mehran 
Bibi  v.  Asghar  Khan  and  anothe  1988  SCMR  4.  Both 
the  Courts  below  by  passing  the  impugned  judgments 
and  decrees  have  taken  into  consideration  the  evidence 
produced by the parties.” 

20. 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  a  case  reported  as “Mst. 

Sughra Bibi alias Mehran Bibi v. Asghar Khan and another” 

(1988 SCMR 4). 

21. 

As  concurrent  findings  of  both  the  learned  lower 

Courts  have  been  challenged  but  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners has failed to point out that the Courts have exercised 

the  jurisdiction  not  vested  in  them  by  law  or  have  failed  to 

exercise the jurisdiction so vested or to have acted in exercise of 

jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity. 

22. 

In  a  case  reported  as  “Haji Wajdad v. Provincial 

Government through Secretary Board of Revenue Government of 

Balochistan, Quetta and others”  (2020  SCMR  2046),  it  has 

been held that: 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          -10-     

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

“There  is  no  cavil  to  the  principle  that  the  revisional 
court, while exercising its jurisdiction under section 115 
of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 ("C.P.C."), as a rule 
is  not  to  upset  the  concurrent  findings  of  fact  recorded 
by  the  two  courts  below.  This  principle  is  essentially 
premised  on  the  touchstone  that  the  appellate  court  is 
the  last  court  of  deciding  disputed  questions  of  facts. 
However, the above principle is not absolute, and there 
may be circumstances warranting exception to the above 
rule,  as  provided  under  section  115,  C.P.C.:  gross 
misreading or non-reading of evidence on the record; or 
when  the  courts  below  had  acted  in  exercise  of  its 
jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.” 

23. 

In  a  case  reported  as “Shahbaz Gul and others v. 

Muhammad Younas Khan and others.”  (2020  SCMR  867),  it 

has also been held that: 

“appraisal of facts of lower courts should not have been 
overturned  by  the  learned  High  Court  in  its  revisional 
jurisdiction  under  Section  115,  C.P.C.  Between  two 
possible  interpretations,  the  one  adopted  by  the  learned 
should  have  been 
Trial  and  Appellate  Courts 
maintained,  keeping  in  mind  the  limited  scope  of 
revisional jurisdiction.”  

24. 

In  a  case  reported  as  “Mst. Zaitoon Begum VS 

Nazar Hussain and another”  (2014  SCMR  1469),  it  has  also 

been held that: 

“Even otherwise, this Court in the case of Kanwal Nain 
v.  Fateh  Khan  (PLD  1983  SC  53)  has  held  that 
concurrent findings of two Courts below are not open to 
interference  in  limited  revisional  jurisdiction  of  the 
High Court, albeit, it may be, to some extent, erroneous 
on point of fact and on point of law, both.”  

25. 

In a case reported as “Shafi Muhammad and others 

v. Khanzada Gul and others”  (2007  SCMR  368),  it  has  also 

been held that:  

“It  is  a  settled  law  that  High  Court  had  very  limited 
jurisdiction  to  disturb  the  concurrent  findings  of  fact 
recorded  by  the  courts  below  while  exercising  power 

 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          -11-     

 Civil Revision No.140 of 2014 

under  Section  115,  C.P.C.,  unless  and  until  the  courts 
below  had  given  concurrent  findings  of  fact  by 
misreading or non-reading of the record or in violation 
of any principle laid down by the superior Courts.” 

26. 

In  a  case  reported  as  “Nazir Ahmed through legal 

heirs v. Umra and others” (2002 SCMR 1114), it has also been 

held that:  

“It  is  trite  law  that  if  the  judgments  impugned  / 
challenged  by  a  litigant  before  a  High  Court  under 
Section  115,  C.P.C.  concurrently  resolve  a  controversy 
of  facts  one  way  or  the  other,  the  same  cannot  be 
interfered with by the High Court.”  

27. 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  cases  reported  as 

“Administrator, That Development through EACO Bhakkar and 

others v. Ali Muhammad”  (2012  SCMR  730), “Ahmad Nawaz 

Khan v. Muhammad Jaffar Khan and others.”  (2010  SCMR 

984)  and  “Rafaqat Ali and others v. Mst. Jamshed Bibi and 

others.” (2007 SCMR 1076). 

28. 

In view of above discussion, instant revision petition 

is meritless, hence the same is dismissed.
