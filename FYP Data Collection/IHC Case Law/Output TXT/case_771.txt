The  details  provided  in  the  instant  case  arc  that 

with  reference  to  fake  bank  account  matter  was  referred  to 

NAB  by  the  Apex  Court  vidc  order  dated  07.01.2019  in 

1  lRC  No.39216-G/2018,  whereby  N/\B  was  directed

regarding  corruption  and  corrupt 

practices  in  opening/ operation  of fake  bank  accounts  vide

3. 

During

it  appeared  that 

2 

W.P.  No.282/2020 

petitioner 

received 

an 

amount 

of  Rs.15  million 

approximately  through  six banking  instruments  from  fake 

bank  accounts  known 

as  Logistic  Trading,  Umair 

Associates  and  Ibrahim  J .inkcrs  from  Summit  Bank  J .td. 

Khayaban-e-Tanzccm  Branch,  Karachi,  Sindh  Bank,  Gole 

Market  Branch  and  Sindh  Bank,  Khayaban-e-Shehbaz 

Branch respectively.  The inquiry  officer has  also taken  over 

the  laptop/hard  disk  from  one  of accused  Aslam  Masood, 

which  reveals that six payments have  been made to present 

petitioner  for  purchase  of  land  at  I Iussainabad.  A call  up 

notice  was  issued  to  the  petitioner  for  his  explanation, 

although no warrant  of arrest has  been  issued. 

4. 

I .earncd  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that 

petitioner  is a sugar  cane  grower  being  agriculturalist  and 

member  of  District  Council  Tande  Allahyar,  Sindh,  who 

owns  joint  family  land  measuring  400  arcs  at  Taluka 

Chamber,  District  Tande  Allahyar:  that  petitioner  also 

holds  agriculture  lands  on  Mukata  (lease)  measuring  700 

acres  at  Taluka  Jhando  Mari,  about  800  acres  at  Taluka 

Chamber  and  700 acres  situated  at  Taluka  Matli,  District 

Badin  and  as  such  he  is  doing  agriculture  business,  who 

grows 

sugarcane,  banana,  cotton,  wheat,  etc.; 

that 

petitioner  has supplied  sugarcane  to Tando  Allahyar Sugar 

Mills  (Pvt.)  Ltd.  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  TASM)  and 

against  said  supply  he received  different  amounts  through 

banking  instrument  from TASM and  some  of the  amounts 

referred  by  the  NAB,  which  were  received  from  CFO 

T/\SM  namely  Aslam  Masood  and  as  such  he  has  no 

3 

W.P.  No.282/2020 

relationship  whatsoever  with 

J .ogistic  Trading,  Umair 

Associates  and  Ibrahim  Linkers;  that  proposed  action  of 

NAB  is  based  upon  malafide  and  harassment  whereby 

N /\B authorities  arc  trying  to link  the  petitioner  with  fake 

bank  accounts in order  to establish  false link with  Asif Ali 

Zardari,  Faryal  Talpur,  etc.  against  whom  reference 

No.02/2019  is  pending  before  the  Accountability  Court, 

Islamabad. 

5. 

Conversely, 

learned  Special  Prosecutor,  NAB 

contends  that  petitioner  is sugarcane  grower  to the  extent 

of  his  lands  but  the  payments  which  he  received  from 

TASM were verified, however,  six instruments  which have 

been  referred  in  the  NAB record  contains  approximately 

Rs.15 million  which  were  transacted  through  fake  bank 

accounts  of  Logistic  Trading,  Umair  Associates  and 

Ibrahim  I .inkcrs,  which  have  been  transmitted  by  the 

accused  /\slam  Masood  to  the  present  petitioner  for 

purchase  of  land  at  I  lussainabad  Farms  being  bcnami, 

therefore,  petitioner  is directly  involved  in corruption  and 

corrupt  practices in terms  of NAO, 1999; that no warrant  of 

arrest  has  been  issued  by  the  NAB against  the  petitioner, 

however,  petitioner  has  still not  satisfied  the  NAB during 

the  inquiry  regarding  his relationship  with  Aslam Masood 

CFO  of  Omni  Group  including  TJ\SM;  that  T/\SM  has 

denied  the  issuance  of  these  six  instruments  as  per  their 

record. 

6. 

We  have  heard  the  arguments  and  perused  the 

record. 

4 

W.P. No.282/2020 

7. 

From  the  tentative  assessment  of  record,  it  reveals 

that  the  petitioner  has  been  summoned  through  call  up 

notice  U/S  19 of NAO,  1999 in inquiry  against  the  holders 

of  public  office,  legal  persons  and  others  regarding 

corruption  and  corrupt  practices  in  opening/  operating  of 

fake  bank  accounts  vide 

letter  dated  21.06.2019  and 

15.01.2020,  however,  during 

the  course  of  inquiry  a 

particular  reference  has  been  made  in  the  call  up  notice  to 

the  petitioner  to explain  his  point  of view  with  justification 

as  to  how  and  under  what  circumstances  petitioner  has 

received  an  amount  of  Rs.15 million  approximately  from 

fake  bank  accounts  of  J .ogistic  Trading,  Umair  Associates 

and  Ibrahim  Linkers.  The  details  provided  in  the  report 

dated  11.03.2020 is as undcr.-

8. 

The  petitioner  while  appearing  before  the  inquiry 

officer  has  taken  a  categorical  stance  that  he  is  sugarcane 

grower  and  owns  joint  family  lands  measuring  400 arcs  at 

Taluka  Chamber,  District  Tando  Allahyar:  that  petitioner 

also  holds  agriculture  lands  on  Mukata  (lease)  measuring 

5 

W.P. No.282/2020 

700 acres  at  Taluka  Jhando  Mari,  about  800 acres  at  Taluka 

Chamber  and  700  acres  situated  at  Taluka  Matli,  District 

Badin  and  as  such  he  is  doing  agriculture  business,  who 

grows  sugarcane,  banana,  cotton,  wheat,  etc.  I le has  also 

taken  specific  stance  that he  has  supplied  the  sugarcane  to 

TASM  for  the  past many  years  and  has  received  payments 

through  banking  channel 

in  millions 

for  the  crushing 

season 

2014-2015, 

which 

arc 

approximately 

Rs.15,145,365.40 

through 

150 

transactions. 

The 

six 

instrument  referred  above  have  been  denied  by  the  TASM 

as  the  said  cheques  were  not  issued  by  the  said  mill  rather 

they  have  provided separate certificate  in which  it has  been 

referred  that  cheques  were  issued  by  Aslam  Masood,  this 

fact  has  been  confronted 

to  the  inquiry  officer,  who  states 

that  he  verified  the  supply  of  sugarcane  to  the  TASM  and 

has  not  found  any 

false  and 

frivolous  or  suspicious 

transaction 

in  the  relationship  of  sugarcane  to  TASM  but 

these  six  banking 

instruments  have  not  been  verified, 

which  were 

issued 

from  Logistic  Trading,  Umair 

Associates  and 

Ibrahim  Linkers,  which  arc  fake  bank 

accounts.  In  this  regard  petitioner  has  taken  a  categorical 

stance  that  alI  these  six  instruments  were  given  by  Aslam 

Masood  CFO  of  TASM,  who 

is  accused 

in  reference 

No.02/2019, 

pending 

adjudication 

before 

the 

Accountability  Court-11, Islamabad. 

9. 

We  have  confronted 

the 

inquiry  officer  as 

to 

whether  said  six  instruments  have  been  confronted 

to  the 

Aslam  Masood,  whereby  it  has  been  stated  at  the  bar  that 

6 

W.P.  No.282/2020 

said  accused  has  been  passed  away  during  proceedings 

and  as such  said  six instruments  could  not  be verified  but 

the  same  were  used  for  the  purchase  of  land/ shares  in 

llussainabad  Farms in four bcnarni persons. 

10. 

The  inquiry  officer  as  well  as  Special  prosecutor 

NAB  have  been  confronted  as  to  whether  petitioner  has 

ever  received  any  benefit  through  any  transaction  other 

than  his  plea  of sugarcane  supply  or  any  property  or land 

has been purchased  in his name in I lussainabad  Farms, the 

inquiry  officer has  denied  this  fact  and  states  that  he  has 

not  yet  come  to  the  conclusion 

that  petitioner  is  a 

beneficiary of those benami lands. 

11.  We  have  asked  the  inquiry  officer  to  place  any 

periodical  record  of  rights,  mutations  or  any  other  land 

instrument  under  the  I .and  Revenue Act to verify that land 

was  transferred  or  purchased  by  petitioner  through  fake 

bank  account  for  his  own  use  or  for  the  use  of any  of his 

ostensible  owner.  The  Inquiry  officer  has  failed 

to 

demonstrate  any  such  transaction  rather  states  that  such 

type  of  evidence  is  not  yet  available,  hence,  this  Court 

comes  to  the  conclusion  that  it  is case  of  further  inquiry. 

The  prinia-jacie  allegation  against  the  petitioner  docs  not 

attract 

any 

corruption 

or 

corrupt 

practices 

in 

opening/  operating  of  fake  bank  account  of  Logistic 

Trading,  Umair  Associates  and  [brahim  Linkers,  even  he 

has not denied the receiving of six instruments  which were 

provided  by Aslam  Masood  Late, who  was  CFO of TASM 

and  even  the  said  banking  instruments  were  issued  in  the 

7 

W.P.  No.282/2020 

same period  when petitioner  has supplied  sugarcane  to the 

T ASM.  In  such  eventuality 

the  matter  could  not  be 

resolved  without  recording  of pro  and  contra  evidence  in 

the  trial  Court,  such  aspect  demonstrate  case  of  further 

inquiry,  hence, any  attempt  to arrest  the  petitioner  by  the 

NAB  under 

the  NAO,  1999  is  considered 

to  be  an 

indication  of harassment.  In such circumstances,  petitioner 

is  entitled  for pre-arrest  bail. Reliance is placed  upon  2017 

CLD 1101 (Alamdar  Hussain  VS NAB). 

12. 

The  inquiry  officer  in  process  of  collection  of 

tangible  evidence,  could  not  collect any  concrete evidence 

to  connect  the  petitioner  with  the  crime  and  present 

petitioner  is  considered  to  be  at  the  tail  end,  he  has 

received  certain  payments  on  the  pretext  of  supply  of 

sugarcane  to  the  TASM, who  has  some  nexus  with  the 

other  co-accused  facing  trial  before  the  Accountability 

Court-II, Islamabad. It  is trite law that when  case of further 

inquiry  comes on  record,  pre-arrest  bail  which  is an  extra 

ordinary  relief  is  available  to  only  those  cases  where 

malafide  on  the  part  of  complainant  or  investigation 

agency  is reflected on  record  though  the  malafide  is often 

difficult  to  prove  and  could  be  inferred  from  facts  and 

circumstances  concerning  a  particular  case.  Reliance  is 

placed  upon  2019 YLR  1865 (A{tab  Ahmed  Memon  VS  The 

Chairman,  NAB).  As such  no  loss has  been  caused  by  the 

petitioner  to  the  public  exchequer  nor  this  allegation  was 

leveled  by  the  NAB,  therefore,  while  relying  upon  2019 

YLU.  650  (Mustafa  Jamal  Kazi  VS  NAB),  2019  YLR  1878 

(Muhammad 

Idrees  VS  NAB),  2018  YLR  Note  293 

8 

W.P.  No.282/2020 

(Ghazan(ar  Ali  VS  Chairman  NAB, 

Islamabad),  2019 

P.Cr.L.l  475 (lameel  Akhtar  VS  Chairman  NAB),  2019 YLR 

Note  92  (Mansoor  Ahmed  U.ajput  VS  DG  NAB  Sindh)  we 

arc  of  the  view  that  if  petitioner  is  arrested  he  will  face 

humiliation  and  harassment  at 

the  hands  of  NAB 

especially  when  there  is no  substantial  material  to connect 

the  petitioner  prirna-facie  with  the  alleged  crime,  hence, 

ad-interim  pre-arrest  bail  granted  to  the  petitioner  vide 

order  dated  30.01.2020 is hereby  confirmed.  The  petitioner 

is  directed  to furnish bail bonds  in the sum of Rs.5,00,000/- 

(Rupees  Five Lac only) with  one  surety  in  the  like amount 

to the  satisfaction  of learned  Deputy  Registrar  (Judicial) of 

this Court.  I lowever,  if NAB authorities  at some later stage 

come  up  with  any  tangible  material  or  incriminating 

material  against  the  petitioner  they  can  approach  this 

Court  for  cancellation  of  pre-arrest  bail  granted  to  the 

petitioner.
