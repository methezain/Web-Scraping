for 

the 

petitioner. 
Mr.  Tahir  Jamil  Butt,  Advocate  for  respondent 
No.1. 

At  the  very  outset, 

learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  submits  that  the  entire  payment 

has  been  made 

and 

nothing 

remains 

outstanding.  When  confronted,  learned  counsel 

for  respondent  No.1  concedes the  position  with 

clarification  that  one  limb  of  the  matter  is  still 

pending  before  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

at  Rawalpindi  and  the  settlement 

is  without 

prejudice 

to  the  same.  Learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.1  also  submits  that  execution 

petition 

filed  by  respondent  No.1  has  also 

become  infructuous  and  shall  be  withdrawn  in 

due  course  of  time.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  seeks  permission 

to  withdraw 

the 

instant  petition.  Allowed. 

2. 

Dismissed  as withdrawn.
