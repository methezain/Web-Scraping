Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

minors.  

Any  other  relief  of  which  this 

Honorable Court deem fit and proper 

may also be granted.” 

02.  Brief 

facts  of 

the  case  are 

that 

petitioner  was  married  to  respondent  No. 

1/Mrs.  Asma  Ishtiaq,  according  to  Muslim 

Rights  and  Ceremonies  and  from  wedlock  of 

the  parties,  one  minor  son  namely  Mustafa 

Balaaj/respondent  No.  2  presently  aged 

about  four  and  a  half  year  and  one  minor 

daughter namely Haram Zara/respondent No. 

3  presently  aged  about  one  and  a  half  year 

were  born  who  are  residing  with  respondent 

No. 1/mother.  

03.  Respondent No. 1/mother of the minors 

filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance,  jewellary  articles,  dower  amount, 

bridal  dresses  and  claimed  the  maintenance 

@ Rs. 300,000/- per month for each plaintiff 

with  10%  annual  increase  till  the  age  of 

majority  of  plaintiffs  No.  2  &  3/minors  and 

also  past  maintenance  for  herself  from  the 

date  of  marriage  and  decree  for  recovery  of 

 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

gold ornaments and dower amount etc.  

04.  The  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  East-

Islamabad,  vide  impugned  interim  order  has 

fixed  the  interim  maintenance  allowance  of 

the respondents No. 1, 2 & 3 @ Rs. 15,000/- 

per  month  each  and  being  aggrieved  by  the 

interim/impugned  order,  instant  writ  petition 

has been preferred.   

05.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia, contends  that  impugned  order  is  not 

maintainable in the eyes of law; the order for 

maintenance  allowance  passed  by  learned 

Judge  Family  court  is  too  harsh,  excessive, 

exorbitant, inflated, steep and over-priced. 

06.  That  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

while  passing 

the 

impugned  order  has 

ignored the pleadings of the parties regarding 

income  of  the  petitioner  mentioned  in  his 

written  statement  and  it  is  quite  impossible 

for the poor petitioner to maintain the minors 

at such excessive rate.  

07.  That  the  impugned  order  for  interim 

maintenance  is  based  on  misreading  and 

 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

non-reading  of  the  pleadings  of  both  the 

parties.  

08.  Arguments heard, record perused.  

09. 

It  is  mentioned  in  Section  14(3)  of  the 

West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 

an interim order passed by a Family 

Court.” 

10. 

It has been held by the Hon‟ble Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan 

in  a  case 

titled  as 

“President  All  Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  V. 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020 SCMR 260)”, that: 

“It is settled law that when the Statute does 

not  provide  the  right  of  appeal  against 

certain  orders,  the  same  cannot  be 

challenged  by  invoking  the  constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High Court in order to 

gain a similar objective. Where a Statute 

has expressly barred a remedy which is not 

available to a party under the Statute, it 

cannot be sought indirectly by resort to the 

constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. 

The High Courts exercising constitutional 

jurisdiction  must  be  fully  cognizant  and 

conscious of this Rule and strictly adhere to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

the same in the interest of advancing the 

policy  of  law  and  delivering  expeditious 

justice in accordance with the law and the 

Constitution. Even otherwise, constitutional 

jurisdiction is equitable and discretionary in 

nature  and  should  not  be  exercised  to 

defeat or bypass the purpose of a validly 

enacted  statutory  provision.”

11. 

In  another  case 

titled  as  “Chief 

Executive  MEPCO  and  others  V. 

Muhammad Fazil and others (2019 SCMR 

919)”,  the Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan 

has held that:  

“Where  the  Court  or  the  Tribunal  has 

jurisdiction  and  it  determines  specific 

question of fact or even of law, unless 

patent legal defect or material irregularity is 

pointed  out,  such  determination  cannot 

ordinarily be interfered with by the High 

Court  while  exercising  jurisdiction  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution.” 

12. 

It has been held by the Hon‟ble Supreme 

Court of Pakistan in case titled as “Chairman, 

NAB V. Muhammad Usman and others (PLD 

2018 SC 28)”, that: 

“The powers of judicial review vested in 

High  Court  under  Article  199  of  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

Constitution is no doubt a great weapon in 

the Judge‟s hands however, the same shall 

not be exercised in a case where discretion 

is  exercised  by  the  subordinate 

court/Tribunal in a fair and just manner 

without violating or disregarding statutory 

provision  of  law,  likely  to  occasion  the 

failure  of  justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction  shall  not  be 

exercised  at  random  and  in  routine 

manner.  The  following  case  law  is 

reproduced for the guidance of the learned 

Judges of the High Court for future course 

of action:   

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmed v. 

Government  of  Pakistan, 

through  Secretary,  Interior 

Division,  Islamabad  (1994 

SCMR 2142) 

(ii)  Shahnaz Begum v. The Hon‟ble 

Judges of the High Court of 

Sindh  and  Balochistan  (PLD 

1971 SC 677) 

(iii)  Malik  Shaukat  Ali  Dogar  v. 

Ghulam Qasim Khan Khakwani 

(PLD 1994 SC 281)  

13.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  also  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i) 

In a case titled Syed Saghir Ahmad 

Naqvi  VS  Province  of  Sindh  (1996 

SCMR 1165), it has been held as follows: 

 
 
 
  
7 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

“The statute excluding a right of 

appeal  from  the  interim  order 

cannot  be  passed  by  bringing 

under attack such interim orders 

in Constitutional jurisdiction. The 

party affected has to wait till it 

matures  into  a  final  order  and 

then to attack it in the proper 

exclusive forum created for the 

purpose  of  examining  such 

orders.” 

(ii) 

In 

the  case 

titled  as  Mumtaz 

Hussain 

alias 

Butta 

VS 

Chief 

Administrator  of  Auqaf,  Punjab  (1976 

SCMR 450), it has been held as follows:- 

“As the said Ordinance has taken 

away  the right of petitioner to 

interim  relief,  learned  counsel 

sulbmitted that this was a ground 

which  entitle  dthe  petitioner  to 

prosecute a writ petitioner despite 

the pendency of the proceedings 

on  the  District  Court.  The 

argument is misconceived because 

the writ jurisdiction of the superior 

Courts cannot be invoked in aid of 

injustice and in order to defeat the 

express provisions of the statutory 

law.” 

14.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed 

to  point  out  as 

to  how 

the 

 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 2673 of 2021 

impugned/interim order passed by the learned 

Judge Family Court was the consequence of an 

error of law or without jurisdiction or in excess 

of jurisdiction.  

15. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
