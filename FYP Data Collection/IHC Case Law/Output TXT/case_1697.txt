The petitioner [Zabih Ullah] seeks post arrest bail 

in  case  FIR  No.  353/2019,  dated  02.08.2019,  under 

sections  392,  411  PPC,  &  Section  14  of  Foreigners 

Act, 

registered  at  Police  Station  Golra  Sharif, 

Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts of the case are that the complainant 

[Muhammad  lrshad]  lodged  a  complaint  against  the 

petitioner  on  30.07 .2019  at  about  8:00  PM,  stating 

therein  that  he was  coming from  Chungi  No. 26  and 

when  he  reached  service  road  Sector  G-13/4  where 

three  persons,  who  were  riding  on  a  motorcycle 

Honda 125, two persons out of them were armed with 

30-bore pistols, forcibly stopped  him and snatched his 

mobile  phone  Samsung  Galaxy  without  SIM,  Q  

mobile  and  valet  containing  his  driving 

licence, 

coloured  copy  of  CNIC,  visiting  cards  and  cash 

amounting to  Rs 45,000/-. Thereafter,  on 02.08.2019 

when the  complaint went  to  PIMS  hospital to  see  his 

sick  friend,  he  identified  the  accused/  petitioner, 

involved  in  the  commission  of  offence,  hence  the 

instant FIR. 

3. 

The  petitioner  applied  for  post  arrest  bail 

before  the 

learned  Court  of  Judicial  Magistrate 

Section-30,  Islamabad which  was  rejected vide  order 

dated  02.09.2019. Thereafter,  the  petitioner/ accused 

applied  for  bail  after  arrest  before  the 

learned 

2 

CRL.MISC.  N0.65-8  /2020 

family  member  and  petitioner  are  present  in  NADRA 

record;  that  the  petitioner  is  previously  non-convict  and 

case of present petitioner  falls within the  ambit of  Section 

(2) of Section 497 Cr.PC. 

4. 

On 

the  other  hand, 

learned  State  counsel 

vehemently  opposed  the  grant  of  bail  to  the  petitioner 

contending  that  mobile  phone  and  pistol  have  been 

recovered  from 

the  petitioner/accused, 

therefore, 

the 

petitioner is  not entitled for concession of bail. 

5. 

After  hearing arguments,  I  have  minutely  perused 

the record. 

6. 

Tentative  assessment of the  record shows that the 

FIR was  lodged after  an  unexplained and  inordinate delay 

of  two  days;  that  no  specific  role  is  attributed  to  the 

petitioner nor the features  of the  alleged accused  persons 

are  mentioned  in  the  FIR,  no  detail  and  number  of  the 

currency  notes  has  been  described  in  the  FIR.  As  such 

case of the  petitioner becomes that  of further  inquiry. The 

accused/ petitioner is  behind the  bar for the  last more than 

seven  months.  No  useful purpose  would  be served  to  the 

prosecution to  keep  the  petitioner  behind  the  bars for  an 

indefinite period. 

7. 

Deeper  appreciation  of  the  evidence  is  neither 

desirable  nor  permissible  at  bail  stage.  The  guilt  of 

accused is  yet to  be  determined by the  learned Trial Court 

after  recording  of  the  evidence.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan, in  the  case  reported  as  "  Manzoor  &  4 

others VS The State" [PLO 1972 Supreme Court 81), has 

observed as  follows:- 

in 

that 

unless 

jail  merely  on 

"It  is  important to  remember  that  bail  is 
not  to  be  withheld  as  a  punishment. 
There is  no  legal or moral compulsion to 
keep  people 
the 
they  have  committed 
allegation 
offences  punishable  with  death  or 
transportation, 
reasonable 
grounds appear to exist to disclose their 
complicity.  The  ultimate  conviction  and 
incarceration  of  a  guilty  person  can 
repair the  wrong  caused  by  a  mistaken 
relief  of  interim  bail  granted  to  him,  but 
no  satisfactory reparation can be  offered 
to  an  innocent  man  for  his  unjustified 
incarceration  at  any  stage  of  the  case 
albeit his acquittal in  the long run." 

8. 

The ultimate conviction and incarceration of a  guilty 

person can repair the wrong caused by a  mistaken relief of 

interim  bail  granted  to  him,  but  no  satisfactory  reparation 

3 

CRL.MISC.  N0.65-B  /2020 

can  be  offered  to  an  innocent  man  for  his  unjustified 

incarceration at  any  stage  of the  case,  albeit  his  acquittal 

in  the long  run. 

9. 

In  view  of the  above facts  and  circumstances,  this 

petition  is  allowed  subject  to  furnishing  surety  bonds  of 

Rs.2,00,000/- (  Two  lacs) with two  sureties,  in  the  amount 

of  Rs.1,00,000/- each,  to  the  satisfaction  of  learned  Trial 

Court. 

10. 

It  is  needless to mention here that the  observations 

made  hereinabove  are  tentative  in  nature  and  shall  not 

design to influence the trial.
