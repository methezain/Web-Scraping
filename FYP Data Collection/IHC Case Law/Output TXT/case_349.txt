The case has been called out repeatedly. 

There is nobody in attendance on behalf of the 

petitioner.  Name  of  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  appears  in  the  cause  list.  It 

seems  that  the  petitioner  is  not  interested  in 

pursuing this petition anymore.

stands dismissed for non-prosecution.
