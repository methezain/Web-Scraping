WRIT PETITION NO. 681 OF 2021 

SYED KHURRAM ABBAS NAQVI. 

VS    

TAYYABA BATOOL, ETC. 

Petitioner by      : 

Mr. Liaquat Ali Tareen, ASC. 

Respondent by: 

S. Shajjar Abbas Hamdani, AHC. 
(Respondent Nos.1 to 4) 

Date of hearing   :  

04.03.2021. 

LUBNA  SALEEM  PERVEZ,  J.  The  petitioner,  Syed  Khurram  Abbas 

Naqvi,  through  instant  writ  petition  has  assailed  order  dated  07.12.2020, 

passed by learned Judge Family Court, East-Islamabad, (hereinafter referred 

to  as    the  Trial  Court),  whereby  petitioner  was  directed  to  pay  interim 

maintenance at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month each for three minors (total 

Rs. 30,000/-), till further orders.  

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial 

Court has committed a material irregularity and illegality while passing the 

impugned order, which is contrary to the facts and law on the subject and as 

such based on conjectures and surmises, is also against the norms of natural 

justice and the pronouncements rendered by the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court. It 

is further contended that the interim maintenance fixed by the learned Trial 

Court,  vide  impugned  order  is  not  only  excessive  but  exaggerated,  hence, 

liable  to  be  set-aside.  He  submitted  that  the  petitioner  is  a  salaried  person 

serving as Lt. Commander in Pakistan Navy, whose net salary per month is 

about  Rs.26,000/-.  He  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial  Court  has  fixed  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P.No. 681/2020  2 

interim  maintenance  without  taking  into  consideration  his  financial  status 

and it is not possible for the petitioner to bear the interim maintenance of Rs. 

10,000/-  per  child  aggregating to  Rs.  30,000/-  per  month.  He  relied on  the 

judgment  of  this  Court  reported  as  Dr.  Aqueel  Waris  v.  Ibrahim  Aqueel 

Waris  (2020  CLC  131)  and  submitted  that  the  impugned  order  dated 

07.12.2020 is liable to be set-aside. 

3. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  Respondent  Nos.  1  to  4, 

vehemently  opposed  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  petitioner  and 

submitted that writ petition against interim maintenance is not maintainable 

and  in  this  regard  placed  reliance  on  the  judgments  reported  as  Abrar 

Hussain  v.  Mehwish  Rana  (PLD  2012  Lahore  420),  Imran  Sajid  v.  Mst. 

Sania (2016 YLR 2801), Ali Adnan Dar v. Judge Family Court (PLD 2016 

Lahore 73). He submitted that the petitioner is a Lt. Commander in Pakistan 

Navy and earning a handsome salary of more than one hundred thousand per  

month  and  can  easily  afford  the  expense  of  his  children  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

10,000/-  per  child  per  month  as  he  was  bearing  the  same  expenses  during 

subsistence of marriage. Learned counsel, therefore, prayed for the dismissal 

of instant petition.  

4. 

5. 

Arguments heard. Record perused. 

The  learned  Trial  Court,  vide  impugned  order  dated  07.12.2020  has 

fixed interim maintenance for three minor children of the petitioner, which 

he has assailed herein by invoking the constitutional jurisdiction of this court 

under Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, as a writ of 

certiorari  and  has  prayed  for  setting-aside  of  the  impugned  interim  order, 

whereby, the learned Trial Court has passed order in terms of section 17-A 

of  the  Family  Court  Act,  1964  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Act,  1964) 

which  provision  empowers  the  learned  Family  Court  to  fix  a  provisional 

      
 
  
W.P.No. 681/2020  3 

monthly  maintenance  keeping  in  view  the  income  of  the  father  during  the 

proceedings in the suit of maintenance till its decision. The purpose of this 

section  appears  to  be  that  the  minors  who  are  dependent  and  are  the 

responsibility of the father should be saved from facing monetary difficulties 

and may be able to manage the routine necessary expenditures till the trial in 

the  suit  for  maintenance  is  finalized,  as  such,  the  findings  of  the  learned 

Family  Court  in  the  impugned  order  are  only  tentative  in  nature  and  not 

final. Whereas, proper quantum of the maintenance allowance is fixed by the 

learned  Family  Court,  after  recording  of  evidence  as  the  issue  of  final 

maintenance  requires  probe  into  the  facts  regarding  financial  status  and 

source  of  income  and  the  High  Courts  should  refrain  from  involving  in 

determination of facts, being beyond the scope of Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the 

Constitution,  1973,  for  the  reason  that  such  jurisdiction  is  exercised  only 

against  the  act  done  or  proceedings  taken  by  the  functionary  which  are 

without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  Guidance in this regard has 

been  sought  from  the  case  law  reported  as  Ghulam  Muhammad  and 

another VSMst. Noor Bibi and others (1980 SCMR 933), Benedict F.D 

Souza VSKarachi Building Control Authority and others (1989 SCMR 

918)  and  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others  VS Major  (Retd.) 

Muhammad Sabir Khan (PLD 1991 SC 476).  

6. 

Section 14 of the Act, 1964, provides for an appeal against the orders 

passed by learned Family Court. Sub-section (3) has been inserted in section 

14 of the Act, vide Ordinance LV of 2002 which prohibits filing of appeal or 

revision  against  interim  orders  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court. 

Therefore,  interference  by  this  Court,  exercising  discretionary  jurisdiction 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution,  against  interim  orders passed by  the 

learned  Family  Court  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  insertion  of  sub-section 

(3) of section 14 of the Act, 1964. In view thereof, I am of the considered 

opinion that the learned Family Court has lawfully exercised its jurisdiction 

      
 
W.P.No. 681/2020  4 

under section 17-A of the Act, 1964 for fixing interim maintenance for the 

minors, as such, no illegality has been committed by the learned Judge while 

passing impugned order dated 07.12.2020.  

7. 

For  what has been discussed above, the instant petition is held to be 

without any substance and is hereby, dismissed. However, the Family Court 

is directed to conclude the trial and finalize the suit within a period of thirty 

days from the date of receipt of this order.
