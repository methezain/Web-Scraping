Date of Hearing

ATHAR MINALLAH, C.J.- 

Through 

this  consolidated 

order,  I  will  decide  the  instant  petition  alongwith  W.P. No.  1133/2019 

[Mst Rukhsana v.  District Judge, Islamabad & 3 others'i. 

2. 

The  facts, 

in  brief,  are  that  Ms  Rakhshanda  Pervaiz 

(hereinafter  referred 

to  as  'respondent  no.3')  entered 

into  a 

marriage  contract  with  Tahir 

Imran  son  of  Sain  Sher  Ahmed 

(hereinafter  referred 

to  as  'petitioner  no.: ')  on  05-10-2008. 

Respondent  no.4  i.e.  Muhammad  Shayan  (hereinafter  referred  to  as 

W.P. No.1548/2019 

-2- 

the  'Minor')  was  born  on  01-08-2009.  The  petitioner 

in  W.P. 

No.1133/2009,  namely,  Mst  Rukhsana  wife  of  Sher  Ahmed 

(hereinafter  referred  to  as 'petitioner  no.2')  is  mother  of  petitioner 

no.1.  Differences between the  spouses led to their divorce which took 

effect  on  14-11-2012.  Respondent no.3  and the  Minor filed  a  suit  on 

27-09-2013  seeking recovery of  maintenance allowance and dowery 

articles. The suit  was contested  by the  petitioners.  They filed  written 

statements  and  out  of  divergent  pleadings six  issues were  framed. 

The learned trial  Court  determined  the  amount  to  be paid as interim 

maintenance in  favour  of  the  Minor and  in  this  regard  an  order  was 

also  accordingly  passed. The  evidence  led  by  respondent  no.3  was 

recorded.  However,  despite  affording  several  opportunities  to  the 

petitioners,  they  absented  themselves  from  the  proceedings  and, 

therefore,  on  21-05-2018  the  learned  trial  Court  ordered  that  they 

would  be  proceeded ex-parte.  After  completing  the  proceedings, the 

learned trial  Court  passed judgment  and  decree,  dated  06-06-2018. 

On  25-09-2018  i.e.  after  almost  three  months  from  the  date  of 

passing  of  judgment  and  decree,  an  application  was  filed  by  the 

petitioners  for  setting  aside the  judgment  and  decree,  dated  06-06- 

2018. The said application was dismissed by the  learned Judge Family 

Court  vide  order,  dated  0803-2019.  The  petitioner  preferred  an 

appeal which was dismissed by the  learned District  Judge, Islamabad 

W.P. No.1548/2019 

-3- 

(West)  vide  order,  dated  15-03-2019.  The concurrent  findings  have 

been challenged by the  petitioners through  the petitions  at  hand. 

3. 

The  learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended 

that;  both the  learned Courts did not appreciate that  after  transfer  of 

the  case no  notice  was issued or  served in  accordance with  law;  the 

case was fixed  for  cross-examination of the  witnesses and,  therefore, 

an  order  to  proceed  ex-parte  could  not  have  been  passed;  the 

provisions of  the  West  Pakistan Family Courts Act,  1964  have  been 

violated;  no  notice  regarding  passing  of  the 'ex-pa rte  decree  was 

issued or  served  on  the  petitioners;  the  ex-parte  proceedings vide 

order,  dated 21-05-2018,  and ex-parte judgment,  dated 06-06-2018, 

were passed in  disregard to  the  mandatory  provisions of the  law;  the 

proceedings  were 

transferred  on  10-04-2018,  while 

the  order 

regarding  proceedings  ex-parte  was  passed on  25-05-2018  without 

issuance of any notice. 

6. 

The  Special Attorney  of  respondent no.1  was also heard. 

He  has  argued  that; 

the  petitioners  had  deliberately  absented 

themselves  from  the  proceedings;  the  petitioner  no.1  failed  to  pay 

the  interim  maintenance ordered by the  learned trial  Court;  the  mere 

fact  that  the  petitioners  were  bound to  pay the  interim  maintenance 

ordered by the  learned trial  Court and failure  on their  part  to  do so is 

W.P. No.1548/2019 

-4- 

sufficient  to  establish  that  they  willfully  absented  themselves  from 

the  proceedings. 

6. 

The  learned  Counsel for  the  petitioner  and  the  Special 

Attorney  who  has appeared on  behalf of  respondent  no.3  have been 

heard and the  record perused with their  able assistance. 

7. 

The  admitted  position 

is 

that 

the  petitioners  had 

contested  the  suit  by  filing  written  statements.  After  evidence 

produced  by  and  on  behalf  of  respondent  no.1  was  recorded,  the 

petitioners  absented  themselves  from  the  proceedings.  The  record 

shows that  during  the  period  of  their  absence, which  was  for  more 

than  three  months,  the  interim  maintenance ordered  by  the  learned 

trial  Court  in  favour  of  the  Minor was  not  deposited  or  paid  by  the 

petitioners.  Petitioner  no.1  is  father  of  the  Minor  and,  therefore  he 

was aware that  it  was mandatory  for  him  to  deposit each month  the 

amount of  interim  maintenance ordered by the  learned trial  Court.  No 

effort  was  made  by  the  petitioners  to  ensure  that  the  order  of  the 

learned  trial  Court  regarding  payment  of  interim  maintenance  is 

complied with.  Had they  been vigilant  about their  obligations,  the ex  

parte  proceedings would  not  have been ordered.  There  is  no force  in 

the  argument  raised  by  the  learned  Counsel for  the  petitioners  that 

since no notice was served after  the  case was transferred,  therefore, 

W.P. No.1548/2019 

-5- 

the  absence  of  the  petitioners  could  not  be  treated  as  willful.  The 

learned  Counsel for  the  petitioners  has not  been able  to  point  out  any 

illegality  or  other 

legal  infirmity  warranting 

interference  with  the 

concurrent  findings.  The  impugned  orders  are  well  reasoned  and  have 

been  passed  alter  taking  all  the  relevant  matters  into  consideration. 

The  learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  argued 

that  decree 

cannot  be  executed  against  the  mother  of  petitioner  no.1.  This aspect 

would  obviously  be  considered  and  dealt  with  in  accordance  with  law 

by the  learned  Executing  Court. 

8. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  these  petitions  are 

without  merit  and,  therefore,  accordingly  dismissed.
