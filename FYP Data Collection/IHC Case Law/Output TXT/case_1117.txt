======================================= 

BABAR  SATTAR,  J.-  The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  an 

order dated 10.07.2021, pursuant to which the right of evidence 

was struck off by the learned Family Court (East), Islamabad due 

to  his 

failure  to  pay  the  complete  amount  of 

interim 

maintenance. 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  stated  that  he 

was short of money on the said date, but now he has deposited 

the  entire  outstanding  amount  of  interim  maintenance  and  has 

appended  the  relevant  challans.  He  further  stated  that  it  would 

be  in  the  interest  of  justice  if  he  is  allowed  to  defend  the  suit 

before  the  learned  Family  Court.  The  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  further  submitted  that  due  to  situation  emerging  out 

Covid-19,  courts  were  dysfunctional  from  March  to  September, 

2020  due  to  which  the  petitioner  was  unable  to  deposit  the 

interim  maintenance  in  a  timely  manner.  He  further  submitted 

that  the  petitioner  is  an  electrician  by  profession  with  limited 

means  and  his  conduct  reflects  that  he  has  made  an  effort  to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                   -2-              Writ Petition No.3360 of 2021 

continue  to  pay  some  money,  even  if  the  entire  amount  could 

not be paid. He further submitted that the petitioner has a right 

to  fair  trial  and  in  view  of  the  language  of  Section  17A  of  the 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964  (“Act”),  the  impugned  order  is  not 

maintainable.  He  further  submits  that  in  case  penal  action  was 

called for, the learned Family Court ought to have, while striking 

off  the  right  of  the  petitioner  to  defend  the  suit  dismissed  the 

same as well in which case the petitioner would have to remedy 

of filing an appeal against such order.   

3. 

The  learned  counsel  for  respondents  No.2  &  3  on  the 

other hand submitted that the conduct of the petitioner does not 

entitle  him  to  any  discretionary  relief  from  this  Court.  He 

submitted  that  the  petitioner’s  conduct  reflected  that  he 

intended to delay the adjudication of the maintenance suit  from 

day one. He submitted that the suit was filed on 12.09.2019 and 

the petitioner did not appear before Court till a proclamation was 

issued  on  03.12.2019.  That  the  response  was 

filed  on 

19.01.2020  and  the  interim  maintenance  order  was  passed  on 

25.02.2020  and  the  maintenance  was  fixed  at  Rs.45,00/-  each 

per month for the minor daughter of the petitioner. He submitted 

that  between  25.02.2020  to  23.09.2020  no  maintenance  was 

deposited  despite  the  matter  having  been  fixed  at  least  eight 

times.  He  submitted  that  on  23.09.2020,  the  petitioner  paid 

Rs.9,000/-  and 

the  matter  was 

fixed 

for  evidence  on 

14.10.2020.  That  on  02.11.2020  the  learned  Family  Court  had 

directed  the  petitioner  to  pay  the  outstanding  arrears  of  the 

interim  maintenance  payable  by  the  petitioner  and  also  issued 

notice  under  Section  17A  of  the  Act  which  requires  that  the 

 
 
 
 
  
                                   -3-              Writ Petition No.3360 of 2021 

interim maintenance is to be paid by the 14th day of each month 

or  else  the  defence  of  the  defendant  is  to  be  struck  off.  He 

submitted  that  the  matter  was  then  fixed  on  09.11.2020, 

12.12.2020,  14.01.2021,  23.01.2021,  24.02.2021,  15.03.2021, 

14.04.2021, 17.05.2021 and 29.06.2021. He submitted that the 

order  sheets  reflect  that  despite  the  direction  of  the  court,  the 

petitioner  did  not  pay  all  outstanding  arrears  and  the  petitioner 

continued  to  pay  Rs.9000  on  alternative  dates  and  finally  on 

10.07.2021  the  impugned  order  was  passed.  He  submitted  that 

in  view  of  the  order  sheet  it  is  evident  that  the  petitioner  has 

continued to act in a delinquent manner despite explicit orders of 

the court learned Family and the said court had already indulged 

the  petitioner  long  enough  before  passing  the  impugned  order. 

He  relied  on  Dr.  Aqueel  Waris  VS  Ibrahim  Aqueel  (2020 

CLC  Islamabad  131),  Mashkoor  Ahmed  Khokhar  VS  The 

Family  Judge  (East),  Islamabad  (2019  CLC  Islamabad 

1635)  and  Minhaaj  Saqib  and  others  VS  Najam-us-Saqib 

and  others  (2018  CLC  Islamabad  506),  for  the  proposition 

that  writ  against 

interim  order 

for  maintenance 

is  not 

maintainable. 

4. 

A  perusal  of  the  order  sheets  reflects  that  the  learned 

Family  Court  has  granted  repeated  opportunities  to  the 

petitioner  to  pay  out  the  interim  maintenance.  Section  17A  of 

the Act states the following:- 

[17A.  Interim  Order  for  Maintenance.-  At  any 

stage of proceedings in a suit for maintenance, the 

Family  Court  may  pass  an  interim  order  for 

maintenance,  whereunder  the  payment  shall  be 

made  by  fourteenth  day  of  each  month,  failing 

 
 
 
 
  
                                   -4-              Writ Petition No.3360 of 2021 

which  the  Court  may  strike  off  the  defence  of  the 

defendant and decree the suit.]  

5. 

The  language  in  the  statute  creates  an  obligation  for  a 

defendant to automatically pay the maintenance before 14th day 

of  each  month,  failing  which  the  Court  has  been  given  the 

powers to impose penalty. The contention of the learned counsel 

for  the  petitioner  that  the  court  ought  to  have  decreed  the  suit 

immediately  after  striking  off  the  defence  of  the  petitioner  is 

misconceived.  The  jurisprudence  that  has  been  developed  in 

relation to Section 17A of the Act as well as Order XVII and Rule 

3  of  CPC  is  that  the  court  ought  to  strictly  apply  the  penal 

provisions  under  such  statutory  provisions  and  the  penal 

provision is a tool provided to the learned trial Court in order to 

move  the  trial  to  the  next  stage.  And  that  it  is  an  obligation  of 

the court to pass a reasoned order in view of the material before 

the  court 

including 

the  pleadings 

filed  by 

the  parties. 

Consequently, the learned Family Court acted in accordance with 

law,  when  while  striking  down  the  right  of  the  petitioner  to 

adduce evidence, it fixed the matter for final arguments so as to 

enable the  petitioner to present  his grounds  before the  court to 

enable  the  Court  to  pass  a  reasoned  order  in  accordance  with 

the pleadings filed by the parties. 

6. 

The order sheets reflects that the learned Family Court 

has already indulged the petitioner consistently over a period of 

almost one and half year reminding him and warning him again 

and again to discharge his obligation in accordance with Section 

17A of the Act prior to taking penal action. And it was only due 

to  the  consistent  and  contumacious  failure  of  the  petitioner  to 

 
 
 
 
  
 
                                   -5-              Writ Petition No.3360 of 2021 

abide  by  the  orders  and  directions  of  the  learned  Family  Court, 

that  the  impugned  order  was  passed.  The  order  of  the  learned 

Family Court does not suffer from any infirmity. Even otherwise 

the conduct of the petitioner as reflected from the order sheet of 

the  learned  Family  Court  reflecting  his  refusal  to  pay  interim 

maintenance  for  his  own  daughter  disentitles  him  to  any 

equitable relief by this Court in its constitutional jurisdiction. 

7. 

For  the aforesaid reasons, this petition is without merit 

is therefore dismissed.
