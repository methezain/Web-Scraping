Petitioner by: 
Mr. Naseem Iqbal, Advocate, 
Respondent No.2 by:  Mr. Umer Aslam, Advocate.  
_____________________________________________________________________ 

MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the  instant  writ 

petition, the petitioner, Muhammad Iqbal Azhar Qureshi, impugns 

the  order  dated  18.02.2014,  whereby  the  learned  Judge,  Family 

Court, Islamabad, dismissed the petitioner’s application to pay the 

dower  amount  of  Rs.100,000/-  and  maintenance  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.40,000/-  per  month 

from  21.11.2011 

to  21.02.2012 

to 

respondent  No.2 

(Mst.  Sonia  Waheed) 

in 

installments  of 

Rs.10,000/- per month  

2. 

Through the instant writ petition, the petitioner, Muhammad 

Iqbal  Azhar  Qureshi,  impugns  the  order  and  decree  dated 

21.12.2013,  passed  by 

the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

Islamabad, whereby respondent No.2’s suit for recovery of dower 

and  maintenance  decreed  with  the  direction  to  respondent  No.3 

(Afzal Iqbal) to handover the dower amount of Rs.10,00,000/- and 

maintenance  from  21.11.2011  to  21.12.2012,  at  the  rate  of 

Rs.40,000/- per month.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the 

petitioner  is  respondent  No.3’s  father;  that  respondent  No.2  had 

instituted  a  suit  for  recovery  of  dower  and  maintenance  against 

respondent No.3 before the learned Family Court; that respondent 

No.3 had executed a special power of attorney in the petitioner’s 

favour  to  contest  the  said  suit;  that  on  21.12.2013,  the  said  suit 

was  decreed  after  the  contesting  parties  took  a  special  oath 

before  the  learned  Family  Court;  that  the  petitioner  filed  an 

application  before  the  learned  Family  Court  to  pay  the  decretal 

amount  in  monthly  installments  of  Rs.10,000/-;  and  that  the  said 

application  was  dismissed  by  the 

learned  Family  Court  on 

18.02.2014.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  further  submitted 

                
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
2 

W.P.No.4187/2014 

that  the  suit  should  have  been  decided  on  merits  instead  of  the 

special oaths taken by contesting parties. Learned counsel for the 

petitioner  prayed  for  the  impugned  order  and  decree  dated 

21.12.2013, as well as the order dated 18.02.2014, to be set aside. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2 

submitted that the petitioner  or  respondent  No.3 could have filed 

an  appeal  under  Section  14  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts 

Act,  1964  against  the  said  order  and  decree  dated  18.02.2014; 

that  since  neither  the  petitioner  nor  respondent  No.3  filed  an 

appeal  against  the  said  order  and  decree,  the  instant  petition  is 

not  maintainable;  that  an  offer  for  special  oath  was  made  on 

behalf  of  respondent  No.3  by  the  petitioner  before  the  learned 

Family Court; that the petitioner or respondent No.3 are estopped 

by conduct from taking a position contrary to the one taken before 

the learned Family Court; that the petitioner decided to challenge 

the  said  order  and  decree  only  after  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court rejected the application for payment of the decretal amount 

in  installments;  and  that  petitioner  was  not  a  party  in  the 

proceedings  before  the  learned  Family  Court,  therefore,  he  does 

not  have  the  locus  standi  to  file  the  instant  petition.  Learned 

counsel  for  respondent  No.2  prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be 

dismissed. 

5. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance. 

6. 

Before going into the merits of the case, I propose to decide 

respondent  No.2’s  objection  to  the  maintainability  of  the  instant 

petition. Since the impugned order and decree was passed by the 

learned  Civil  Judge  exercising  the  powers  of  a  Family  Court, 

under  Section  14  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Court  Act,  1964,  a 

decision given or a decree passed by such a Court is appealable 

to  the  Court  of  the  District  Judge.  The  decree  dated  21.11.2013, 

was  for  the  payment  of  dower  amount  of  Rs.10,00,000/-  and 

maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.40,000/-  per  month.  Since, 

respondent  No.3  (who was  the defendant in the  suit  instituted  by 

respondent No.2 for recovery of dower and maintenance) had the 

 
 
 
3 

W.P.No.4187/2014 

alternative  remedy  of  filing  an  appeal  against  the  said  order  and 

decree passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court,  the  instant  appeal  is 

not maintainable. 

7. 

As  regards  the impugned  order dated  18.02.2014,  whereby 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  dismissed  the  application  to  pay 

the  decretal  amount  in  installments,  the  same  is  interlocutory 

order. In the case of Mst. Maham Shabbir VS Salman Haider (2014 

CLC 330), the Hon'ble Islamabad High Court held as follows:- 

“9. … High Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction is not sitting as 
a Court of appeal, or court of revision. Its jurisdiction to interfere 
on the point of fact is limited. Interlocutory order if does not 
suffer  from  any  illegality,  malafide  or  is  not  in  excess  of 
jurisdiction or lack of exercise of jurisdiction or not based on 
misreading, misconstruing or discarding of the evidence and 
material  on  record  cannot  be  challenged  in  constitutional 
jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the facts of each case are to be 
considered  separately  and  no  uniform  principle  can  be 
determined for exercising the writ jurisdiction.” 

8. 

It  is  my  view  that  exceptional  circumstances  which  could 

justify invoking the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 

of  the  Constitution  against  an  interim  order  would  be  when  the 

order  or  action  assailed  was  palpably  without 

jurisdiction, 

malafide,  void  or  coram non judice.  The  order  impugned  in  this 

petition  is  clearly  interlocutory  in  nature.  The  impugned  order  is 

neither  without  jurisdiction,  nor  malafide,  void  or  coram non 

judice  so  as  to  warrant 

interference 

in  the  constitutional 

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution. 

9. 

The  order  dated  18.02.2014,  being  purely  interlocutory  in 

nature  could  not  be  subjected 

to  challenge  by 

filing  a 

constitutional  petition  before  this  Court  as  it  would  amount  to 

defeating  the  legislative  intent  behind  Section  14(3)  of  the  West 

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964.  Therefore,  I  am  not  inclined  to 

interfere  in  the  said  interlocutory  order  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge, Family Court. 

10. 

In view of the above, this petition is dismissed with no order 

as to costs.
