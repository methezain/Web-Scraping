2.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  petitioner’s

claim has not been appreciated to the extent of his claim qua security

fee  amounting  to  Rs.50,000/-,  Ex.P2/3,  admission  fee  Rs.157,500/-,

Ex.P2/1  and  rate  of  maintenance  fixed  @  Rs.30,000/- per  month for

the year 2016 & 2017, whereas rest of claims have been passed in his

favour;  that  petitioner’s  mother  and  respondent  No.3  were  married

on  06.09.2011  and  petitioner  was  born  on  22.11.2012,  who  resides

with  his  mother  in  the  house  of  maternal  grandfather,  whereas

respondent No.3 is permanent resident of USA and doing business in

the  said  country,  who  has  never  shown  love  and  affection  towards

the petitioner; that respondent No.3 abused the mother of petitioner

in the month of June, 2015, she was ousted from house by mother and

sister  of  respondent  No.3;  that  trial  court  has  not  appreciated  the

evidence in a proper manner and complete claim of petitioner has not

been allowed.

3.

Conversely, learned counsel for respondent No.3 contends that

each  and  every  aspect  has  been  appreciated,  even  quantification  of

maintenance available  on  evidence  and  record  and  it  is  not

compulsory  and  obligatory  to  pay  each  and  every  penny  to  the

petitioner,  especially  when  claim  has  otherwise  appreciated  by  the

Family Judge based upon sound reasons.

5.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that petitioner  is  minor  son  of

respondent  No.3 claims  his  maintenance  from  father  though

W.P. No.498/2021

3

concurrent decree has been passed in his favour, however, two claims

were turned down i.e. amount of security fee referred as Ex.P2/3 and

admission  fee  Ex.P2/1  as  well  as  lower  rate  of  maintenance  of

Rs.30,000/- per month for the year 2015-2016. Though these aspects if

considered  in  the  light  of  judgment  rendered  by  the  trial  court

maintenance was fixed in the year 2015-2016 @ Rs.30,000/- and then

Rs.50,000/- per  month  for  the  year  2017,  for  2018-2019  Rs.70,000/-,

which  goes  up  with  10%  annual  increase  on  Rs.70,000/-.  All  these

aspects if considered in the light of principles settled by the Supreme

Court  of  Pakistan  in 2023  SCMR  413  (Arif  Fareed  VS  Bibi  Sara  and

others) wherein it has been held that:-

The Family Courts Act, 1964 does not provide the right of second appeal

to  any  party  to  the  proceedings.  The  legislature  intended  to  place  a  full

stop  on  the  family  litigation  after  it  was  decided  by  the  appellate  court.

However,  we  regretfully  observe  that  the  High  Courts  routinely  exercise

their  extraordinary  jurisdiction  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of

Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  as  a  substitute  of  appeal  or  revision

and more often  the purpose of  the statute i.e., expeditious disposal of  the

cases is compromised and defied.

6.

Similarly, in  another  case  reported  as 2023  SMCR  246 (Mst.

Tayyeba Ambareen VS Shafqat Ali Kiyani), it has been held that:-

The  object  of  exercising  jurisdiction  under  Article  199  of  the

Constitution 

of 

the 

Islamic  Republic 

of

Pakistan, 

1973

("Constitution")  is  to  foster  justice,  preserve  rights  and  to  right  the

wrong. The appraisal of evidence is primarily the function of the Trial

Court  and,  in  this  case,  the  Family  Court  which  has  been  vested  with

exclusive jurisdiction. In constitutional jurisdiction when the findings

are  based  on  mis-reading  or  non-reading  of  evidence,  and  in  case  the

order of the lower fora is found to be arbitrary, perverse, or in violation

of  law  or  evidence,  the  High  Court  can  exercise  its  jurisdiction  as  a

W.P. No.498/2021

4

corrective measure. If the error is so glaring and patent that it may not

be acceptable, then in such an eventuality the High Court can interfere

when  the  finding  is  based  on  insufficient  evidence,  mis  reading  of

evidence, non-consideration of material evidence, erroneous assumption

of  fact,  patent  errors  of  law,  consideration  of  inadmissible  evidence,

excess or abuse of jurisdiction, arbitrary exercise of power and where an

unreasonable view on evidence has been taken.

7.

However,  all  these  factors  have  been  confronted  to  the

petitioner’s counsel who is unable to make any exception from these

principles.  It  is  also  settled  law  that  decision  of  appellate  court  is

considered  as  final  on  facts  and  it  is  not  for  High  Court  to  offer

another opportunity of hearing, especially in family cases where the

legislature’s  intent  to  not  prolong  the  dispute  is  clear  as  held by

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan in  C.P  No.1418/2023  titled M.  Hamad

Hassan  VS  Mst.  Isma  Bukhari  and  2  others,  dated  17.07.2023  (not  yet

published).

8. While  attending  the  proposition  based  upon  above  principles,

learned counsel for the petitioner has not pointed out any exceptional

circumstance or  patent  illegality  committed  by  the  Family  Court  or

first  appellate  court,  even  it  has  not  been  denied  by the  petitioner’s

side that appellate court has given due right of hearing and decided

the matter accordingly, which has attained finality, therefore, instant

writ  petition  is  not  made  out  and  the  same  is  hereby dismissed.

However, it is noted with great concern that respondent No.3/father

has  not  paid  due  maintenance  till  date  and  even  no  proof  of

maintenance  has  been  brought  on  record.  In  such  eventuality,

W.P. No.498/2021

5

learned  Executing Court seized  with the  matter  shall  proceed  in  the

matter  expeditiously  and  get  the decree  executed  in  favour  of

petitioner by all means and shall submit a report in this regard within

three (03) months.
