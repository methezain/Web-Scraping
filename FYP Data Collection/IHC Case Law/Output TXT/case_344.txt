Date of order/ 
proceedings  

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

14.03.2023.  Mr.  Waseem  Ahmed  Abbasi,  Advocate  for  the 

Applicant/Petitioner.  
Mian Abdul Razzaq, Advocate for Respondents. 

C.M. No. 3857/2022. 

This is an Application for restoration of 

the titled Writ Petition which was dismissed for 

non-prosecution on 13.09.2022.   

2. 

Thereafter, the instant C.M. was filed in 

respect  of  which  notice  was 

issued  on 

18.11.2022,  however,  on  09.01.2023  it  was 

noted  that  notices  could  not  be  issued  due  to 

non-deposit  of  process  fee  by  the  Petitioner.   

Moreover, the reason stated for non-availability 

or  non-attendance  on  the  date  when  W.P.No. 

3857/2022  was  dismissed  is  that  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  Applicant/Petitioner  was  stuck 

in  traffic.    I  find  such  reason  to  be  absolutely 

frivolous and devoid of merit and not a reason 

that  is  expected  from  an  officer  of  this  High 

Court  especially  considering  that  none  was 

present  on  behalf  of  the  Petitioner  on  prior 

dates  as  well  for  which  no  reason  has  been 

given.  

3. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  C.M. 

for restoration is dismissed.
