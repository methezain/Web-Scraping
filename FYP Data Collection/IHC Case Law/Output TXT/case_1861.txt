MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the  instant 

writ  petition,  the  petitioner,  Habib  Bank  Limited  (“H.B.L.”), 

impugns:- 

i. 

ii. 

Findings/recommendations 
of 
respondent  No.3/Wafaqi  Mohtasib,  on  complaint  No. 
HRQ/0006044/13 filed by Abdul Sattar Siddiqui (respondent 
No.1); 

07.07.2014, 

dated 

Order  dated  30.05.2016  of  respondent  No.5/President  of 
Pakistan on the petitioner’s representation under Article 32 
of 
the  Establishment  of  office  of  Wafaqi  Mohtasib 
(Ombudsman)  Order,  1983,  against  respondent  No.3’s 
findings dated 07.07.2014. 

2. 

The facts essential for the disposal of the instant petition are 

that  on  14.07.1996,  respondent  No.1  (Abdul  Sattar  Siddiqui) 

retired  from  the  employment  of  H.B.L.  upon  attaining  the  age  of 

superannuation.  H.B.L.  had  increased  the  pension  payable  to  its 

pensioners/retired employees but not at the same rate as the one 

paid  by  the  Federal  Government  to  retired  civil  servants.  On 

17.07.2013,  respondent  No.1  filed  a  complaint  before  the Wafaqi 

Mohtasib/Ombudsman  under  the  provisions  of  the  Establishment 

of  the  Office  of  Wafaqi Mohtasib  (Ombudsman)  Order,  1983 

(“P.O.No.1  of  1983”)  seeking  an  increase  in  his  pension  at  the 

                
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
2 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

same rate as allowed and paid by the Federal Government to the 

civil  servants.  After  obtaining  a  response  from  the  Finance 

Division  and  conducting  a  hearing,  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib,  on 

07.07.2014,  gave  findings 

in  respondent  No.1’s  favour  and 

adverse to  H.B.L.’s  interests.  The  recommendations  given by  the 

Wafaqi Mohtasib were as follows:- 

“a)  The Agency should revisit the case of non-increase in 
pension of the complainant since December, 2000 for 
redressing his grievance. 

b)  The  Agency  should  revisit  all  similar  cases  of  HBL 
pensioners, addressing the systemic issues to see as to 
what went wrong during transition that led to such a grave 
deprivation of people for so long and take necessary 
corrective measures. 

c)  Compliance should be submitted within 60 days of the 
receipt  of  these  Findings  or  reasons  for  non-
implementation intimated in terms of Article 11(2) of P.O. 
No.1 of 1983 within the said period.”   

3. 

Aggrieved  by  the  said  findings/recommendations,  H.B.L. 

filed  a  representation  before 

the  President  of  Pakistan 

(“President”) under Article 32 of P.O. No.1 of 1983. On 30.05.2016, 

the President  accepted  H.B.L.’s representation  and set-aside the 

findings  of  the Wafaqi Mohtasib  primarily  on  the  ground  that  the 

latter  lacked  jurisdiction  in  the  matter.  However,  the  President 

converted  respondent  No.1’s  complaint  before  the  Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  into  a  petition  before  the  President  of  Pakistan  and 

directed  the  Finance  Division  and  H.B.L.  to  consider  respondent 

No.1’s case as well as similarly placed pensioners who had opted 

for retirement “when they were eligible for increase in pension on 

the analogy of other Civil Servants”.  

4. 

Vide letter dated 27.06.2016, the Finance Division forwarded 

a  copy  of  the  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016  to  the  State 

Bank  of  Pakistan  so  as  to  consider  the  complaints  of  the 

pensioners  of  H.B.L.  and  other  banks  and  resolve  the  matter  in 

light  of  the  said  order.  After  deliberation  with  H.B.L.  and  other 

banks,  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan,  vide  letter  dated  12.07.2016, 

advised  H.B.L.  and  other  banks  to  raise  the  pension  and  pay 

arrears to the old pensioners who retired prior to the privatization

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

of  H.B.L.  in  light  of  the  directions  issued  by  the  President  in  the 

said order dated 30.05.2016.  

5. 

The  Wafaqi Mohtasib’s  findings  dated  07.07.2014  and  the 

President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016  have  been  impugned  by 

H.B.L. in the instant writ petition.  

CONTENTIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE 
PETITIONER/H.B.L.:- 

6.  Mr. Shahid Anwar Bajwa, Advocate Supreme Court, learned 

counsel for H.B.L., after narrating the facts leading to the filing of 

the 

instant  petition,  submitted  that  H.B.L.  was  a  company 

incorporated  under  the  provisions  of  erstwhile  Companies 

Ordinance, 1984, and was operating as a banking company under 

the  provisions  of  the  Banking  Companies  Ordinance,  1962;  that 

H.B.L.  had  been  nationalized  under  the  provisions  of  the  Banks 

(Nationalization)  Act,  1974; 

that  subsequently,  H.B.L.  was 

privatized  and  in  this  regard,  share  purchase  agreement  dated 

26.02.2004  was  executed  by  and  between  the  Privatization 

Commission,  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  and  the  Aga  Khan  Fund 

for  Economic  Development  S.A.;  that  presently,  the  Government 

of  Pakistan  does  not  have  any  shareholding  in  H.B.L.;  and  that 

after  the  enactment  of  the  Banks  (Nationalization)  (Amendment) 

Act,  1997  (“the  1997  Act”),  the  Federal  Government  has  been 

divested of the power to issue directions to H.B.L.  

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  H.B.L.  further  submitted  that  by  virtue 

of  the  circular  dated  30.11.1977  issued  by  the  Finance  Division, 

pension was payable to the employees of banks, including H.B.L.; 

that after the enactment of the 1997 Act, H.B.L. had financial and 

administrative  autonomy;  that  vide  circular  dated  22.01.1998 

issued  by  H.B.L.,  increases  in  emoluments  ranging  from  90%  to 

130%  were  allowed  to  all  employees  of  H.B.L.;  that  the  said 

circular was issued with the approval of the Board of Directors of 

H.B.L.  and  not that  of the  Federal Government;  that vide circular 

dated 30.12.1998, H.B.L. restructured the pay scales, pensionary 

benefits,  etc.  of 

its  employees;  and  that  several  circulars 

 
 
 
 
4 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

regarding the restructuring of the terms and conditions of H.B.L.’s 

employees have been issued from time to time. 

8. 

Furthermore,  it  was  submitted  that  respondent  No.1  had 

chosen not  to  make H.B.L.  as  a party  to  his  complaint  before the 

Wafaqi Mohtasib; that at no material stage, was any notice issued 

by  the Wafaqi Mohtasib  to  H.B.L.;  that  the Wafaqi Mohtasib  gave 

its  findings  on  respondent  No.1’s  complaint  on  07.07.2014;  that 

the said  findings  were  communicated  by  the  Office of  the Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  to  the  Secretary,  Finance  Division,  vide  letter  dated 

05.08.2014;  that  the  said  findings  were  not  sent  by  the  Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  to  H.B.L.;  that  H.B.L.  came  to  know  about  the  said 

findings  on  18.09.2014  when  it  received  letter  dated  15.10.2014 

from  the Internal Finance  Wing of the Finance Division; that soon 

after  gaining  knowledge  of  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib’s  said  findings, 

H.B.L. filed a representation before the President under Article 32 

of P.O.No.1  of 1983; that the said  representation was decided on 

30.05.2016; and that vide letter dated 12.07.2016, the State Bank 

of Pakistan advised H.B.L. to “give rise in pension and pay arrears 

to the old pensioners retired prior to the privatization of [the] 

Bank, in the light of [the] Order of the President as well as the 

directions of the Ministry, in letter and spirit.”  

9. 

Learned  counsel  for  H.B.L.  further  submitted  that  the 

President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016  is  without  jurisdiction;  that 

after holding that the Wafaqi Mohtasib did not have the jurisdiction 

to give findings against H.B.L., that the President did not have the 

jurisdiction  to  convert  respondent  No.1’s  complaint  before  the 

Wafaqi Mohtasib  into  a  petition  before  the  President  of  Pakistan; 

that  the  provisions  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983  do  not  authorize  the 

President  to  convert  such  a  complaint  into  a  petition  and  issue 

directions  thereon;  that  since  the  dispute  between  H.B.L.  and 

respondent No.1 pertained to the latter’s service, the jurisdiction 

of  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib  was  barred  under  Article  9(2)  of  the 

P.O.No.1 of 1983; and that since the issue regarding whether the 

retired employees of H.B.L. were entitled to increases in pension 

is  the  subject  matter  of  civil  suit  No.344/2008,  which  is  still 

 
 
5 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

pending  adjudication  before  the  Hon'ble  High Court  of  Sindh,  the 

jurisdiction  of the Wafaqi Mohtasib  in  the matter was  also barred 

by Article 9(1)(a) of P.O.No.1 of 1983. Learned counsel for H.B.L. 

prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the  relief 

sought therein.  

CONTENTIONS OF THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  RESPONDENT 
NO.1:- 

10.  On  the  other  hand,  Messrs  Abdur  Rahim  Bhatti,  Advocate 

Supreme  Court  and  Hassan  Rashid  Qamar,  Advocate,  submitted 

that at the time of respondent No.1’s retirement in the year 1996, 

H.B.L. was owned and controlled by the Government of Pakistan; 

that  vide  circular  dated  30.11.1977,  the  Finance  Division  had 

informed  the  Chairman,  Pakistan  Banking  Council,  that  for 

providing better social security, it had been decided to introduce 

pension  and  retirement  benefits  for  the  officers/executives  of 

banks, 

including  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  and  financial 

institutions  as  had  been  introduced  by  the  Federal  Government 

for  civil  servants;  that  in  the  said  circular,  it  was  also  mentioned 

that the changes or revisions  in the  rates or scales of pension or 

gratuity  that  may  be  made  by  the  Federal  Government  shall  also 

apply  to  the  officers/executives  of  banks;  that  the  said  circular 

was  circulated  by  H.B.L.  on  27.02.1978  giving  a  choice  to  its 

employees  to  opt  for  the  pension  scheme  or  gratuity  and 

provident  fund;  that  respondent  No.1  had  opted  for  the  pension 

scheme;  that  after  respondent  No.1’s  retirement,  he  was  given 

pension  based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Pay  Commission 

constituted  by  the  Federal  Government;  that  as  per  the  said 

recommendations, respondent No.1 was to be paid pension in the 

same  manner  and  at  the  same  rate  as  payable  by  the  Federal 

Government to the retired civil servants; and that up to December 

2000, respondent No.1’s pension was increased.  

11.  Learned counsel for respondent No.1 further submitted that 

H.B.L.  was  privatized  in  the  year  2004;  that  since  the  Finance 

Division’s  circular  dated  30.11.1977  has  till  date  not  been 

superseded or withdrawn, H.B.L. is bound to pay pension to its old 

pensioners  with  the  same  increase  as  paid  by  the  Federal 

 
 
 
6 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

Government  to  civil  servants;  that  the  policies  made  by  the 

management  of  H.B.L.  cannot  override  the  provisions  of  the  said 

circular;  that  it  was  respondent  No.1’s  fundamental  right  to  be 

granted  an  increase  in  pension;  and  that  the  refusal  on  H.B.L.’s 

part in granting an increase in pension is a violation of respondent 

No.1's  fundamental  rights  as  well  as  the  Principles  of  Polices 

enshrined in the Constitution.  

12.  Furthermore,  it was  submitted  that  the President  had  erred 

by holding that the findings of the Wafaqi Mohtasib in respondent 

No.1’s  favour  were  without jurisdiction;  that  respondent  No.1 did 

not  assail  the  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016  since  a 

direction  had  been  issued  therein  to  the  Finance  Division  and 

H.B.L.  to  redress  respondent  No.1’s  grievances;  that  the  said 

direction  contained  in  the  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016 

does not suffer from any jurisdictional infirmity; and that under the 

Constitution, the President has inherent power to issue directions 

to  the Government. Learned  counsel  for respondent No.1 prayed 

for the writ petition to be dismissed. In making their submissions, 

learned counsel for respondent No.1 placed reliance on the cases 

of  Abdur Rehman VS Federation of Pakistan (2010 PLC (C.S.) 

619), Hafiz Muhammad Arif Dar VS Income Tax Officer (PLD 1989 

SC  109),  and  Nawab  Syed  Raunaq  Ali  VS  Chief  Settlement 

Commissioner (PLD 1973 SC 236), etc. 

13. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties,  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance. 

14. 

 The facts leading to the filing of the instant writ petition are 

set out in sufficient detail in paragraphs No.2 to 5 above, and need 

not be recapitulated.   

15.  H.B.L.  was  established  in  1942  with  the  efforts  of  Mr. 

Muhammad  Ali  Habib.  In  the  year  1974,  H.B.L.  was  nationalized 

under the provisions of the Banks  (Nationalization) Act, 1974. On 

26.02.2004,  H.B.L.  was  privatized.  51%  of  H.B.L.’s  shares  were 

sold  through  the  Privatization  Commission  to  the  Aga  Khan  Fund 

for  Economic  Development  S.A.  The  share  purchase  agreement, 

 
 
7 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

whereby  the  Aga  Khan  Fund  for  Economic  Development  S.A. 

purchased  the  said  shareholding,  was  executed  on  26.02.2004. 

12.5%  of  H.B.L.’s  shares  are  traded  on  the  stock  market.  The 

remaining 36.5% of H.B.L.’s shares were sold by the Government 

of  Pakistan  to  a  group  of  private 

investors  through  the 

Privatization  Commission.  Vide 

letter  dated  11.05.2015,  the 

Ministry  of  Finance,  Revenue,  Economic  Affairs,  Statistics  and 

Privatization, the disinvestment of the residual shareholding of the 

Government of Pakistan in H.B.L. was confirmed. It is an admitted 

fact that after April 2015, the Government of Pakistan did not own 

any  shareholding  in H.B.L.  It  may  be  mentioned  that the  decision 

to  privatize  the  Government  of  Pakistan’s  shareholding  was 

upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in its judgment, in the case 

of Dr. Akthar Hassan Khan VS Federation of Pakistan (2012 SCMR 

455).  

16.  Respondent  No.1  asserts  that  his  pension  has  not  been 

increased since December, 2000. One’s heart goes out to the old 

pensioners  of  H.B.L.,  who  upon  their  retirement,  expected  that 

their pension would be increased at the same rate and proportion 

as granted to civil  servants  in  terms of  circular dated 30.11.1977 

issued by the Finance Division.  Little did they know that the Banks 

(Nationalization)  Act,  1974,  would  be  amended  in  1997,  H.B.L. 

would  be  privatized  in  2004  and  its  new  management  would  give 

them  an  increase  in  their  pension  but  not  at  the  same  rate  as 

allowed  by  the Government  to  the  civil  servants.  Emotions  aside, 

while  adjudicating  upon  this  case,  I  am  only  concerned  with  the 

question  as  to  whether  a  writ  of  certiorari  is  to  be  issued  with 

respect  to  the  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016 wherein  he,  in 

exercise of  the  powers  under Article  32  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983,  has 

held that the Wafaqi Mohtasib had no jurisdiction to issue findings 

dated  07.07.2014  on  respondent No.1’s  complaint  but  thereafter, 

converted  the  said  complaint  into  a  petition  to  the  President  of 

Pakistan and issued directions to the Finance Division and H.B.L. 

in  the  said  order.  In  other  words,  this  Court  is  to  determine 

whether  or  not  to  declare  the  directions  to  the  Finance  Division 

 
 
8 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

and H.B.L. contained in the President’s order dated 30.05.2016 to 

have  been  issued  without  lawful  authority  and  are  of  no  legal 

effect.  

17.  As  mentioned  above,  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib,  on  07.07.2014, 

decided  respondent  No.1’s  complaint  and  recommended  inter-

alia that  the  Finance  Division  should  revisit  the  case  of  non-

increase  in  respondent  No.1’s  pension  since  December  2000. 

H.B.L.’s  representation  against  the  said  findings  before  the 

President  was  successful 

inasmuch  as  vide  order  dated 

30.05.2016,  the  latter  accepted  the  said  representation  and  set-

aside  the  findings  of  the Wafaqi Mohtasib  on  the  ground  that  the 

Wafaqi Mohtasib  did  not  have  jurisdiction  in  the  matter.  The 

President did so because respondent No.1 in his complaint before 

the Wafaqi Mohtasib  had  agitated  a  matter  regarding  his  service 

with  H.B.L.  Article  9(2)  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983  provides  that  “the 

Wafaqi Mohtasib shall not accept for investigation any complaint 

by or on behalf of a public servant or functionary concerning any 

matter related to the Agency in which he is, or has been working 

in respect of any personal grievances relating to his service 

therein.”  The  Superior  Courts,  in  several  cases,  have  interfered 

with  the  decisions  made  by  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib  and/or  by  the 

President  of  Pakistan,  where  jurisdiction  had  been  assumed  in 

violation  of  Article  9(2)  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983.  Reference  in  this 

regard  may  be  made  to  the  judgments  in  the  cases  of  Pakistan 

International  Airlines  Corporation  VS  Wafaqi  Mohtasib  (1998 

SCMR 841), Muslim Commercial Bank Ltd. VS Momin Khan (2002 

SCMR  958),  Pakistan  International  Airlines  Corporation  VS 

Caption  M.S.K.  Lodhi  (2002  SCMR  1004)  and  Civil  Aviation 

Authority VS Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) (PLD 2001 Karachi 

304).  

18.  After holding that the Wafaqi Mohtasib had no jurisdiction to 

entertain the complaints  of the old pensioners  of H.B.L.  involving 

issues relating to their service in H.B.L., the President converted 

the  complaints  of  the  complainants  before  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib 

into  “petitions to the President of Pakistan”  and  directed  the 

 
 
9 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

Finance  Division  and  H.B.L.  to  consider  the  cases  of  the 

complainants  and  other  old  pensioners  of  H.B.L.  who  opted  for 

retirement when they were eligible for increase in pension on the 

analogy  of  other  civil  servants.  For  the  purposes  of  clarity, 

paragraphs  15  and  16  of  the  President’s  said  order  dated 

30.05.2016 are reproduced herein below:-  

“15.  In the circumstances, it will be expedient that the President 
while accepting the representations of HBL on technical grounds 
for want of jurisdiction of the Wafaqi Mohtasib in the matter, may 
be pleased to convert the complaints of the complainants into the 
petitions to the President of Pakistan and direct the Finance 
Division as well as HBL to consider the cases of the complainants 
and other old pensioners of the bank who opted for retirement 
when they were eligible for increase in pension on the analogy of 
other Civil Servants. 

16.  Accordingly, the President has been pleased to accept the 
representation of the Habib Bank Limited and set aside the 
recommendations of the Wafaqi Mohtasib while converting the 
complaints into the petitions, with the directions to the Finance 
Division and HBL to consider the cases of the complainants as 
well as other similarly placed pensioners in the above terms.”  

19.  The  vital  question  that  needs  to  be  determined  is  whether 

the President, after holding that the Wafaqi Mohtasib did not have 

the  jurisdiction  to  decide  respondent  No.1’s  complaint,  could 

convert  respondent  No.1’s  complaint  into  a  petition  before  the 

President of Pakistan and issue directions to the Finance Division 

and H.B.L. It is an admitted position that P.O.No.1 of 1983 has no 

provision  empowering  the  President  to  convert  a  complaint  filed 

before the Wafaqi Mohtasib into a petition before the President of 

Pakistan  while  deciding  a  representation  against  the  findings  of 

the Wafaqi Mohtasib  under  Article  32  of P.O.  No.1  of  1983.  While 

deciding  such a representation,  the  President is  to  remain  within 

the  four  corners  of  the  jurisdiction  conferred  upon  him  by  the 

provisions  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983.  Article  32  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983 

provides  that  any  person  aggrieved  by  any  decision  or  order  of 

the  Wafaqi Mohtasib  may,  within  thirty  days  of  the  decision  or 

order,  make  a  representation  to  the  President,  who  may  pass 

such order thereon as he may deem fit. Since P.O.No.1 of 1983 is 

a  special  law  specifically  providing  for  the  jurisdiction,  functions 

and  powers  which  the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib  can  exercise,  the 

 
 
 
 
10 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

President  while deciding  a  representation  against  the findings  or 

recommendations  of  the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib,  cannot  exercise 

jurisdiction, functions and powers not specifically conferred upon 

him by the said Order. Since in the case of Federation of Pakistan 

VS Muhammad Tariq Pirzada (1999 SCMR 2189), it has been held 

that  the  jurisdiction  vested  in  the  President  under  Article  32  of 

P.O.No.1  of  1983  partakes  of  appellate  jurisdiction,  and  since 

appellate proceedings are in continuation of original proceedings, 

the President while deciding a representation against the findings 

of the Wafaqi Mohtasib could not give findings which were beyond 

the  jurisdiction  of  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib.  In  the  said  case,  it  was 

also  held  that  under  the  scheme  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983,  the 

President  exercises  the  same  nature  of  functions  as  are 

performed  by 

the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib. 

In  other  words, 

the 

jurisdiction, functions and powers that the President can exercise 

cannot  be  dehors  or  beyond  the  jurisdiction,  functions  and 

powers  that  the Wafaqi Mohtasib  can  exercise  under  Article  9  of 

P.O.No.1  of  1983.  The  only  additional  power  that  has  been 

conferred on the President by Article 31 of P.O. No.1 of 1983 is to 

refer  any  matter,  report  or  complaint  for  investigation  and 

independent recommendation by the Wafaqi Mohtasib. It may also 

be  mentioned  that  the  provisions  of  the  Federal  Ombudsman 

Institutional  Reforms  Act,  2013,  do  not  confer  any  additional 

powers on the President while deciding a representation against a 

decision or order of the Wafaqi Mohtasib.  

20.  The President, while hearing  and deciding a representation 

against  an  order or decision  of the Wafaqi Mohtasib,  does  so not 

in  his  capacity  as  the  President  of  Pakistan  but  as  a  persona 

designata  under  Article  32  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983.  A  persona 

designata, while conducting or presiding over proceedings under 

a  special  law,  cannot  exercise  powers  not  vested  in  him  by  such 

special law. The President acting in exercise of jurisdiction under 

Article  32  of  P.O.No.1  of  1983  could  not  arrogate  to  himself 

powers  under  the  Constitution  or  some  other  law  and  issue 

directions in purported exercise of such power. After holding in no 

 
 
11 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

uncertain terms that “the complainants have chosen the forum of  

the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib  who  has  no  jurisdiction  to  accept  the 

complaints  for  investigation  as  the  matter  involves  personal 

grievances of the complainants relating to their service in the 

bank”,  and  setting  aside  the  recommendations  of  the  Wafaqi 

Mohtasib,  the  President  ought  not  to  have  converted  the 

complaints  into  petitions  to  the  President  of  Pakistan  and  issued 

directions  to  the  Finance  Division  and  H.B.L.  If  such  directions 

were  issued  by  the  President  while  exercising  jurisdiction  under 

Article 32 of P.O. No.1 of 1983, they (i.e. his directions) would be 

as bereft of jurisdiction as the President had declared the findings 

of the Wafaqi Mohtasib to be.  

21.  The  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016  is  silent  as  to  the 

provision  of  law  or  the  Constitution  in  exercise  of  which  the  said 

directions were issued by him after converting respondent No.1’s 

complaint  before  the  Wafaqi Mohtasib  into  a  petition  before  the 

President  of  Pakistan.  Article  48(1)  of  the  Constitution  provides 

that in exercise of his functions, the President shall act  on and in 

accordance  with the  advice  of the  Cabinet or the  Prime  Minister. 

In  the  case  at hand,  it  is  an  admitted  position  that  no advice was 

given by the Cabinet or the Prime Minister for the issuance of the 

directions  given  by  the  President  to  the  Finance  Division  and 

H.B.L. 

in  the  order  dated  30.05.2016.  Even  otherwise,  the 

President  can  only  act  in  his  discretion  in  matters  in  respect  of 

which  he  has  been  empowered  by  the  Constitution  to  do  so.  The 

Constitution  generally,  and  Chapter  1,  Part-III 

thereof 

in 

particular, does not empower the President to issue directions of 

the nature issued  by him  in  the said  order dated 30.05.2016.  The 

learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  also  could  not  cite  any 

provision  of  the  Constitution  or  any  statute  under  which  the 

President had issued the said directions. Even if it is assumed that 

the  Constitution  or  some  law  (other  than  P.O.  No.1  of  1983) 

conferred  on  the  President  of  Pakistan  the  power  or  authority  to 

issue  directions  like  the  ones  issued  by  him  in  his  order  dated 

30.05.2016,  he  could  not  have  issued  such  directions  while

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

deciding  a  representation  under  Article  32  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983 

against the findings of the Wafaqi Mohtasib. Therefore, it is safe to 

hold  that  the  directions  issued  by  the  President  while  deciding 

H.B.L.’s  representations  against  the  findings  of  the  Wafaqi 

Mohtasib  are  without  lawful  authority  and  of  no  legal  effect.  In 

holding  so,  I  derive  guidance  from  the  law  laid  down  in  the 

following cases:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Dr. Zahid Javed VS Dr. Tahir Riaz 

Chaudhary (PLD 2016 SC 637), a decision made by the 

Syndicate  of  the  University  of  Punjab  was  challenged 

in a petition under section 11-A of the University of the 

Punjab  Act,  1973  (“the  1973  Act”),  before  the 

Chancellor.  The  order  passed  by  the  Chancellor 

allowing  the  petition  was  challenged  in  a  writ  petition 

before the Hon'ble Lahore High Court. The judgment of 

the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  allowing  the  writ 

petition  was  assailed  before  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court. Section 11(1) of the 1973 Act provided that the 

Governor  of  the  Punjab  shall  be  the  Chancellor  of  the 

University.  The  crucial 

issue  that  needed  to  be 

determined  was  whether  the  Governor  of  the  Punjab, 

while  exercising  revisional  powers  in  his  capacity  as 

the  Chancellor  of  the  University  of  the  Punjab  under 

section 11(8) of the 1973 Act was bound to act and/or 

to seek advice of the Cabinet/Chief Minister in terms of 

Article 105(1) of the Constitution, which provides inter-

alia  that  the  Governor,  in  the  performance  of  his 

functions,  shall  act  on  and  in  accordance  with  the 

advice of the Cabinet or the Chief Minister. It was held, 

by  majority,  that  the  Chancellor  of  the  said  University 

is  a  persona designata  under  the  1973  Act  and  is 

conferred  power  in  a  different  capacity  which  cannot 

be  termed 

identical  to  that  of  the  office  of  the 

Governor. Accordingly, it was held that the Chancellor 

of  the  said  University  while  exercising  revisional 

 
 
13 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

powers  under  section  11-A  of  the  1973  Act  was  not 

required  to  seek  advice  of  the  Cabinet  or  the  Chief 

Minister.  

(ii) 

In the case of University of the Punjab, Lahore VS Ch. 

Sardar Ali (1992 SCMR 1093),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court  quoted  with  approval  the  law  laid  down  in  the 

case of Dr. S. C. Barat VS Hari Vinayak Pataskar (AIR 

1962  Madhya  Pardesh  73),  wherein  it  was  held  as 

follows:- 

“When an Act confers powers on the Governor not 
qua Governor but in a different capacity held by him 
by virtue of his office as Governor, the powers and 
duties so conferred are not the powers and duties of 
the office of the Governor. They are the powers and 
duties of a different office which the Governor holds 
by virtue of his office as Governor. It is altogether 
erroneous to say that as the other office is held by 
the person who is the Governor of the State by virtue 
of his office as Governor, therefore the powers and 
duties he exercises or performs of that other office 
under the relevant Act are the powers and duties of 
his office as Governor .... Thus the powers and duties 
that the Chancellor exercises or performs under the 
Act are not any powers or duties conferred on the 
Governor qua Governor or of a capacity which he 
occupies by virtue of his office as Governor. They are 
the powers and duties of a public capacity held by 
the  personage  who  is  also  the  Governor.  The 
Chancellor's powers under the Jabalpur University 
Act are thus not the powers and duties of the office 
of the Governor and consequently the protection 
provided by Article 361(1) cannot be invoked by the 
Chancellor  in  respect  of  the  exercise  and 
performance of the powers and duties of his office as 
Chancellor under the Jabalpur University Act.” 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of Federation of Pakistan VS Muhammad 

Tariq Pirzada (1999 SCMR 2744), it has been held that 

the  President  under  P.O.  No.1  of  1983  is  a  statutory 

body and has to function as such under the provisions 

and  the  scheme  envisaged  by  the  said  Order. 

Furthermore,  it  was  held  that  where  the  President’s 

decision  under  Article  32  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983  is  in 

violation  of  the  law,  the  High  Court,  in  exercise  of  its 

Constitutional jurisdiction, could interfere in the same.

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of Federation of Pakistan VS Muhammad 

Tariq Pirzada (1999 SCMR 2189), the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court while deciding a review petition held that under 

the  scheme  of  P.O.  No.1  of  1983,  the  President 

exercises  the  same  nature  of  functions  as  are 

performed  by  the  Ombudsman.  Furthermore,  it  was 

held  that the  President while performing  his  functions 

under  Article 32 of  P.O.  No.1 of 1983,  acts  in  a quasi-

judicial and not in an administrative capacity, which is 

totally distinguishable from administrative actions; and 

that  the  adjudicatory/quasi-judicial  powers  vesting  in 

the President under Article 32 of P.O. No.1 of 1983 are 

to  be  exercised  by  him  in  his  individual  judgment  by 

recording  reasons  in  writing  and  not  on  the  advice  of 

the Cabinet or Prime Minister.  

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Khalid  VS  Muhammad 

Naeem (PLD 2012 Lahore 492),  an  application  was 

filed  before  the  Court  of  the  learned  Rent  Controller 

for  the  consolidation  of  the  ejectment  petition  with 

proceedings  under  the  Arbitration  Act,  1940,  which 

were pending before the Civil Court. Incidentally, both 

the  said  proceedings  were  pending  before  the  same 

Presiding  Officer.  The  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court 

upheld  the  order  whereby  the  application  for  the 

consolidation  of  the  said  proceedings  was  dismissed. 

Paragraphs  10  and  11  of  the  said  report  are 

reproduced herein below:- 

“10. The proceedings under Arbitration Act, 1940 are 
to be taken up by Civil Court while ejectment petition 
is to be decided by the Rent Controller a persona 
designata under the provisions of West Pakistan 
Urban Rent Restriction Ordinance, 1959. These two 
jurisdictions are entirely different. Pleadings, issues, 
evidence, and other material in both the matters 
being different ought to be decided independently 
and separately. 

11. In our judicial system, a Civil Judge has been 
assigned different jurisdictions e.g. the power of 
Rent Controller under the Rent Laws, to act as a 

 
 
 
15 

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

Family  Judge  under  the  Family  Laws,  to 
act as Guardian  Judge  under  the Guardians,  and 
Wards Act, to exercise powers as Magistrate under 
the provisions of Cr.P.C. etc. but that does not mean 
that while he is exercising different jurisdictions, all 
the proceedings before him can t be amalgamated. 
In the case in hand, although the Presiding Officer 
was the same who was acting as Rent Controller, as 
also the Civil Judge but in one he is a persona 
designata and exercising quasi judicial jurisdiction 
whereas with regard to other one he was acting as a 
Civil  Judge  under  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure. 
Neither two jurisdictions nor the proceedings under 
two entirely different laws can be consolidated or 
amalgamated.” 

22. 

It  is  well  settled  that  in  cases  of  absence  or  excess  of 

jurisdiction, certiorari may be granted by this Court in exercise of 

jurisdiction  under  Article  199(1)(a)(ii)  of 

the  Constitution. 

Consequently, the said order dated 30.05.2016, only to the extent 

of  the  issuance  of  directions  by  the  President  to  the  Finance 

Division and H.B.L., is declared to be without lawful authority and 

of  no  legal  effect.  Consequently,  the  directions  contained  in  the 

said order are set aside.  

23.  Since  the  letter  dated  12.07.2006  issued  by  the  State  Bank 

of Pakistan advising H.B.L. to give rise in pension and pay arrears 

to old pensioners who retired prior to the privatization of the said 

Bank  is  based  on  the  President’s  order  dated  30.05.2016,  the 

advice  in  the  said  letter  will  have  the  same  legal  status  as  the 

directions given by the President in the said order. In the case of 

Yousaf Ali VS Muhammad Aslam Zia (PLD 1958 SC 104),  it  has 

been held inter-alia that if on the basis of a void order subsequent 

orders have been passed either by the same authority or by other 

authorities,  the  whole  series  of  such  orders,  together  with  the 

superstructure  of  rights  and  obligations  built  upon  them  must, 

unless  some  statute  or  principle  of  law  recognizing  as  legal  the 

changed  position  of  the  parties  is  in  operation,  fall  to  the  ground 

because  such  orders  have  as  little  legal  foundation  as  the  void 

order  on  which  they  are  founded.  The  law  laid  down  in  the  said 

case has consistently been followed by the Superior Courts of this 

country  in  several  cases  including  but  not  limited  to    Muhammad

                                          W.P. No.2934/2016 

Tariq  Khan  VS  Khawaja  Muhammad  Jawad  (2007  SCMR  818), 

Rehmatullah  etc  VS  Saleh  Khan  (2007  SCMR  729),  Talib  Hussain 

VS  Member  Board  of  Revenue  (2003  SCMR  549),  Pakistan 

Industrial  Promoter  VS  Nawazish  Ali  Jafri  (2003  YLR  1277),  and 

Crescent  Sugar  Mills  and  Distally  Limited  VS  Central  Board  of 

Revenue (PLD 1982 Lahore 1).  

24.  Since the President, in his order dated 30.05.2016, has set- 

aside  the  Wafaqi  Mohtasib’s  findings  dated  07.07.2014,  the 

petitioner’s  prayer  in  this  petition  that  the  said  findings  be 

declared unlawful has been rendered infructuous.  

 25. 

In  view  of  the  above,  this  petition  is  allowed  in  the  above 

terms with no order as to costs.
