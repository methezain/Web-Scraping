18.06.2019.  Syed  Abaid  Ullah Shah, Advocate for petitioner

Mr. Fareed  Hussain  Kaif, State Counsel.
Ghulam  Abbas Khan,  ASI.

Through  this Crl. Misc. petition, the petitioner

has applied  for post-arrest  bail in case FIR No.380,  dated

04.09.2018,\J  /5395/  412  PPC, P.S. Golra, Islamabad.

2. 

Brief facts referred in the instant  case are that

complainant  got lodged the instant FIR with the

allegations  that four unknown  Persons armed  with

pistols entered into his house  i.e. House  No.927,  Street

No.3,  Sector G-1.4/4, Islamabad  on 03.09.2018 at about

09:30 p.m. and detained all the family members

including complainant's  son, wife, nephew and one of

his friend and snatched gold jewelry, mobile phones,

caslr,  ATM  card, driving license  and fled away in Toyota

car grey colour.

neither nominated  in the FIR, nor any incriminating

evidence is  available  against the petitioner;  that

petitioner is behind the bars since  08.10.2018  and no

useful purpose would be achieved  by keeping  the

petitioner  behind the bars.

4. 

Conversely,  learned  State Counsel  has resisted

the instant post-arrest  bail on the ground that petitioner

has been identified during the course of identification

parade  and even recovery  has been  effected from him

and there is likelihood  of early conclusion of trial in near

future, therefore,  petitioner  is not entitled  for concession

of post-arrest  bail.

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard, record perused.

From the tentative assessment of record, it

reveals that petitioner has been charged in case  FIR

No.380, dated  04.09.2018,  U /S 395/412 PPC,  P.S. Golra,

Islamabad with the allegations  that he alongwith  three

others co-accused  armed with pistols entered  into

about 09:30 p.m. and snatched jewelry weighing 06 tola,

of Rs.75,000/  -, cheque book and keys of car and fled

away  from the scene on Toyota  Corolla car grey colour.

8.  Cursory glimpse of  record reflects that

petitioner  is member  of. gang of dacoits, who are used to

commit offence of dacoity  and at present  six different

cases  of similar nature  have  been registered  against  the

petitioner and others co-accused.  Investigation  officer

has submitted  challan in the trial Court  on 21..11..2018

and at present charge  has been framed. The offence  with

which  petitioner  has been charged falls within the

prohibitory  clause of Section 497 Cr.P.C. and as such

prima-facie petitioner is connected  with the alleged

crime,  which is hideous  in nature and granting bail to

the petitioner  at this stage would amount  to trivialize

and play down the gravlty of offence allegedly

committed by him.  Hence,  petitioner  is not entitled for

bail on merit and the same is hereby dismissed In such

type of situation  it is appropriate  to pass direction  to the

trial Court to conclude the trial within shortest  possible

time while relying upon 201.1  SCMR  7332 (Rehmatullah

VS The  Statel.

9. 

Keeping  in view the above, learned  trial Court

seized  with the matter is directed to conclude the trial

within period of six months  under  intimation  to this

Court excluding  the Courts vacation
