Raja  Saad  Sultan,  Assistant  Attorney 
General  with  Mohsin  Pasha,  Joint  Estate 
Officer. 

The  husband  of  petitioner  was 

working  as Assistant Accounts Officer  (BPS- 

16)  in  Social Welfare and Special Education, 

Islamabad.  Petitioners'  husband expired  on 

28.07.2013;  while 

in  service,  he  was 

allotted 

government 

accommodation 

bearing Quarter  No.14/6,  Cat.Ill,  Sector G- 

10/2,  Islamabad vide  allotment  letter  dated 

10.09.2009.  After  demise  of  husband,  the 

petitioner  along with  her children  is  residing 

in 

the  above  said  Quarter  since 

its 

allotment.  The  Estate  Office  issued  notice 

on  02.05.2017  for  vacation  of  Quarter  in 

question  which  was  challenged  by  way  of 

suit  by  the  petitioner  before  the  court  of 

plenary  jurisdiction.  The  referred  suit  was 

dismissed  by 

learned 

trial  court  vide 

judgment  dated  11.10.2017;  appeal  was 

~.R.  No.437-2017

preferred  which  was  dismissed  vide 

judgment  dated  15.12.2017. 

2. 

The petitioner,  in person, submits that 

her  husband died  during  service,  however, 

his  pension  is  not  being  paid;  it  is  also 

submitted  that  she  has  no  male  child  to 

support  the 

family  and  they  are 

in  a 

destitute  state.  It  was  also  submitted  that 

as and when, dues of  her husband are paid, 

she shall vacate the premises. 

3. 

The Joint Estate Officer submitted that 

after  death  of  a  government  servant, 

government 

accommodation 

can 

be 

retained  by  his/her  family  for  a  period  of 

one 

year 

under  Rule  15(1)(a) 

of 

Accommodation Allocation  Rules, 2002  and 

since said period has long expired  therefore 

there  is  no justification  for  the  petitioner  to 

retain government accommodation. 

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  the  parties 

have been heard and the documents, placed 

on record, examined. 

5. 

It 

is  an  admitted  position 

that 

allotment  of  government  accommodation 

was  made  to  the  deceased  husband  of 

petitioner,  however,  upon  his  demise,  the 

petitioner  and her family  are  residing in the 

same for  more than  one year.  It  is  also an 

admitted  position  that  requisite  period,  for 

,.R.  No.437-2017 

3 

which the  property  could be  retained  by the 

petitioner  after  death  of  her  husband,  has 

long expired  and there  is  no justification  for 

her to  retain the same. 

6. 

The  fact  that  petitioner  is  not  being 

paid  pension  has  no  connection  with  the 

retention  of government  accommodation. 

7. 

The judgments  passed by learned trial 

court  as  well  as  learned  appellate  court  do 

not  suffer 

from  any  jurisdictional  error 

warranting  interference. 

8. 

For  what  has  been  discussed above, 

instant  petition 

is  without  merit  and  is 

accordingly dismissed.
