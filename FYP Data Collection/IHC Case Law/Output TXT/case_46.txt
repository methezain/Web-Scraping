for 

The 

learned  counsel 

for 

the  Petitioner 

(Ghazala Asjad) relies upon Ghulam Ali VS Province 

of Sindh, PLD 2020 284 to contend that even when 

there  is  no  specific  prayer  to  such  effect  the  High 

Court  is  empowered  to  strike  down  any  law  if  it  is 

found to be ultra vires.  

2. 

Be  that  as  it  may,  the  learned  counsel  was 

confronted  with  the  latest  judgment  of  the  apex 

Court, whereby it has been held that a High Court is 

not  empowered  to  take  suo  moto  action.  In  this 

regard  the  learned  counsel  seeks  time  to  peruse  the 

said judgment and assist the Court as it appears that 

the Petitioners are seeking striking down of Section 

2  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  (Amendment) 

Ordinance, 2001 or in the alternative direction to the 

Federal Government to issue Notification pursuant to 

Section 5(3) of the Family Courts Act, 1964 and for 

the High Court to invoke Section 5(3) of the Family 

Courts  Act,  1964  in  order  to  empower    Family 

Courts to take up the matters regarding polygamy as 

per  Section  6(5)  of  the  Muslim  Family  Law 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ordinance,  1961  despite  the  fact  that  none  of  such 

actions are included in their prayer. 

3. 

The  learned  Additional  Attorney  General  is 

directed  to  appear  in  respect  of  notice  under  Order 

XXVII-A,  C.P.C.  already  issued  vide  the  Order 

dated 17.03.2023.

Relist on 09.08.2023.
