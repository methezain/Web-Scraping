Writ Petition No.2694 of 2O19

Raja Muhammad  Ilyas Janjua.

VS
The learned  Judge Family court, Islamabad and 04 others.

S. No. of
order/
roceedin
02.

at of

07.1o.2019. Syed Ghazanfar  Ali Gillani and Mr. Sohail
the

Saleem Awan,  Advocates for 
Petitioner.
Raja Nisar-ul-Haq  Abbasi, Advocate  for
respondents No.2 to 5.

Through the instant petition, the
petitioner has  assailed order  dated

02.07.2019,  whereby  on the application of
respondents  No.2 to  5,  the  order for

maintenance  has been passed  for payment  of

sum of Rs.4,000 /- per month.

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner,

inter-alia,  contended  that order for interim
maintenance has been passed against

respondents  No.3 and 4, who are adults and

the petitioner is not duty bound to maintain

them; that no inquiry  was conducted  and the

order suffers from error of law.

3

Learned counsel  for responcients
No.2 to 5, inter-alia,  contended  that the

instant petition is not maintainable inasmuch

as the order  impugned  is interim. It was also

contended that father is  duty bound to

maintain male son till the age of majority  and

female daughter, if  she is  dependent,

however,  there is an exception, which is that

where  the son suffers  from any disability, the

father has to maintain. Reliance was placed on

cases  reported as "Ali Akbar VS Additional

District Judge,  Malkwal and others"  (PLD

2077 Lahore 787), "Minhaaj Saqib and

others VS Najam-us-Saqib and others" (2O78

CLC 5OG), "Mashkoor Ahmed Khokhar VS The

Family Judge (East),  Islamabad  and others"

(2079  CLC 7635),  and "Humayun Hassan VS

Arslan Humayun and another"  (PLD 2073  SC

ss7).

4

Arguments advanced  by learned

counsel for the parties  have been heard and

record  perused with their able assistance

5

Admittedly,  the order impugned  in

the instant  petition is interim and it is trite law

that a  petition under  Article 199 of the

Constitution  against  the interim order is not

maintainable in family matters. Reliance is

placed on cases reported as "Minhaaj Saqib

and others VS Najam-us-Saqib  and others"

(2078 CLC sOG), and "Mashkoor  Ahmed

Khokhar  VS The Family Judge (East),

Islamabad  and others" (2079 CLC 7635)

-3-

Writ  Petition  No.2694  of 2019

Even otherwise,  the impugned  order does not

suffer from any error of law or jurisdictional
error inasmuch as  respondent No.3 is

allegedly  disabled and respondent  No.4 is not

married, hence the petitioner is obligated to

maintain them. Reliance  is placed on cases

reported  as "Humayun  Hassan  VS Arslan

Humayun  and another" (PLD 2073 SC 557)

and "Ali Akbar VS Additional District Judge,

Malkwat and others" (PLD 2077 Lahore

787). Needless  to observe that learned trial

Court during course of trial shall, after parties
have led evidence,  decide the issue of
eligibility of respondents No. 3 and 4  to

receive  maintenance  for their father.

6

For the above reasons, the instant

petition is without merit and is accordingly

dismissed.
