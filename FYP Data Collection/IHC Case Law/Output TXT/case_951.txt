======================================= 

BABAR  SATTAR,  J.-  The  petitioner  has  impugned 

judgment and decree passed by the learned Judge Family Court 

(West),  Islamabad  dated  30.11.2020  and  judgments  and 

decrees  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West), 

Islamabad  dated  07.07.2021  while  disposing  of  the  appeal  filed 

by  the  petitioner  as  well  as  appeal  filed  by  respondent  No.3. 

Pursuant  to  the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  respondents 

No.3 has been granted maintenance in the amount of Rs.5,000/- 

per  month  for  the  Iddat  period  and  the  minor  children  of  the 

petitioner  (respondents  No.4  &  5)  have  been  granted 

maintenance  in  the  amount  of  Rs.4,500/-  per  month  each  with 

an increase of 10% per annum w.e.f. May of 2014. 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that 

the  increase  has  been  given  effect  since  2014  and  the  learned 

Family Court and the learned Additional District Court have taken 

into account the salary of the petitioner at the time of passing of 

the  judgment  as  opposed  to  the  salary  in  May  2014  when  the 

suit  was  filed  and  from  which  date  the  maintenance  has  been 

 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                   -2-              Writ Petition No.3231 of 2021 

fixed. He  further  contended that  it was borne out by the record 

that 

respondent  No.3  had  continued 

to 

live 

in 

the 

accommodation  provided  by  the  petitioner  up  until  the  time  of 

divorce and consequently she was not liable to any maintenance 

for the Iddat period. 

3. 

Respondent  No.3  appeared  in  person  and  sought  for 

enhancement  of  the  maintenance  amount.  She  contended  that 

the college fee of the daughters of the petitioner i.e. respondents 

No.4  &  5  far  exceeded  the  amount  of  the  maintenance  granted 

and given that the petitioner had the ability to engage a counsel 

and expend resources on litigation, he must necessarily have the 

means to bear the expenses of his daughters. 

4. 

In  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  which  has  been  upheld  by  the 

learned  Additional  District  Court,  the  maintenance  has  been 

calculated  on  the  basis  of  salary  income  of  the  petitioner  in  the 

year  2019  and  2020.  The  quantum  of  maintenance  appears 

reasonable and in accordance with law, but it has been fixed on 

the  basis  of  take  home  salary  for  the  year  2020.  The  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  has  noted  in  the  impugned  judgment  that 

the petitionerâ€™s salary, as of January 2019, was Rs.29,775/-. The 

Judgment  also  notes  that  the  petitioner  admitted  that  he 

received  take  home  salary  in  the  amount  of  Rs.36,000/-  per 

month  after  various  deductions.  Consequently  the  quantum  of 

maintenance fixed at the time of announcement of judgment by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  i.e.  30.11.2020  appears  to  be 

proportionate to the income of the petitioner. The learned Judge 

 
 
 
 
  
                                   -3-              Writ Petition No.3231 of 2021 

Family Court has, however, not taken into account the salary of 

the  petitioner,  as  of  May  2014,  when  the  marriage  ended  and 

from  which  month  maintenance  has  been  awarded  by  the 

learned Judge Family Court, subject to enhancement at the rate 

of 10% per annum. Given that the salary as of November 2020, 

was Rs.36000/- as admitted by the petitioner before the learned 

Judge Family Court, the salary, as of May 2014, would naturally 

be  less  than  that  in  2020  given  that  over  the  years  the  salary 

would have gone up due to application of increments etc. To the 

extent that the learned Judge Family Court has taken the salary 

from  2020  and  applied  it  retrospectively  to  award  maintenance 

starting from the year 2014, the impugned judgment and decree 

of the learned Judge Family Court suffers from legal infirmity.  

5. 

It is settled law that the maintenance granted ought to 

be  proportionate  to  the  means  of  income  as  determined  by 

Family  Court  on  the  basis  of  documentation  produced.  This 

aspect  of  the  matter  was  also  not  appreciated  by  the  learned 

Additional District Court. Consequently the impugned judgments 

and decrees are modified to the extent that  the maintenance in 

the  amount  of  Rs.4,500/-  per  month  with  10%  annual  increase 

has been awarded since May of 2014, and such fixation shall be 

given  effect  from  the  date  on  which  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court  passed  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree.  The  learned 

Family  Court  by  order  dated  15.09.2015  ordered  that  the 

petitioner pay an interim maintenance for respondents No.4 & 5 

in the amount of Rs.4,000/- and Rs.3,000/-, respectively, and it 

is  not  contested  that  the  petitioner  has  continued  to  pay  such 

interim maintenance. The amount of maintenance fixed for each 

 
 
 
 
  
                                   -4-              Writ Petition No.3231 of 2021 

of  respondents  No.4  and  5  at  Rs.4,500/-  per  month  with  10% 

increase annually will therefore apply from the date of judgment 

and  decree  of  the  leaned  Judge  Family  Court  dated  30.11.2020 

and not retrospectively from May of 2014. To the extent that the 

petitioner  has  not  paid  maintenance  from  May  of  2014  up  until 

15.09.2015, when the order for payment of interim maintenance 

was passed by the learned Judge Family Court, the petitioner will 

be  liable  to  pay  such  maintenance  to  respondents  No.4  &  5  in 

the  amount  fixed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  on  interim 

basis  i.e.  Rs.4,000/-  and  Rs.3,000/-,  respectively,  from  May 

2014 to 15.09.2015. 

6. 

The contention of the petitioner that respondent No.3 is 

not  entitled  to  be  granted  maintenance  for  the  Iddat  period  is 

without  force.  The  learned  Judge  Family  Court  noted  that 

respondent  No.3  continued  to  live  in  the  accommodation 

provided  by  the  petitioner  up  until  divorce  was  given  effect  and 

was maintained by the petitioner till such time and was therefore 

not  entitled  to  pass  maintenance  during  subsistence  from 

marriage. But respondent No.3 was granted maintenance for the 

Iddat  period  after  the  divorce  was  given  effect.  And  to  such 

extent  the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  suffer  from  no 

infirmity. 

7. 

In  view  of  the  above,  this  petition  is  allowed  and  the 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  will  stand  modified  to  the 

extent  that  the  maintenance  allowance  in  the  amount  of 

Rs.4,500/- per month with 10% annual increase has been given 

effect 

from  May  of  2014.  The  maintenance  will  remain

Rs.4,500/-  per  month  with  10%  annual  increase  will  be  given 

effect  from  30.11.2020.  And  the  petitioner  will  also  be  liable  to 

pay  maintenance  in  the  amount  of  Rs.4,000/-  and  Rs.3,000/-, 

respectively, for respondents No.4 and 5 for the period from May 

of  2014  up  until  such  time  that  the  petitioner  began  making 

payment  of  maintenance  in  accordance  with  fixation  of  interim 

maintenance  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  by  order  dated 

15.09.2020.
