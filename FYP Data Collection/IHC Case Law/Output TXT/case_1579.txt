Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel

Advocates for the petitioner.

Through  the instant writ petition under
Section 491 Cr.P.C., the petitioner,  Dr. Sultan
Ahmad Chaudhry,  seeks the issuance  of a writ of
habeas  corpus to  recover his  mother,
Mst. Maryam  Fateh, from the custody of his sister,
Mst. Areeta Chaudhry  (respondent No.1),  and her

children (respondents  No.2 to 4).
2.  The petitioner and respondent No.1's father
is said to have died in the year 1990. The family
disputes between  the lega! heirs of the petitioner
and respondent  No.1's father  were said to have
been settled in the year 2002.
3.  As per the contents of the writ petition, the
petitioner  and respondent No.1's  mother, namely
Mst. Maryam Fateh, has been living with
respondent No.1 since a long time. At first,
Mst. Maryam  Fateh was living with her daughter  in

Faisalabad  and subsequently,  at lslamabad.
4.  Since I do not see this case to be one of an
illegal confinement, the instant petition is
dismissed in, /r.nrhe. lf the petitioner  feels that his
mother  is being maltreated  by respondents  No.1

to 4, he may avail other remedies  available to him

under the law.
