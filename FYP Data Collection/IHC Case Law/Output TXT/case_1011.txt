petitioner. 
Sardar  Arshad  Mehmood  Khan,  Advocate  for 
respondent No.3. 

  The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  judgment 

dated  12.07.2021,  passed  by  the  learned 

District  Court  (West),  Islamabad,  pursuant  to 

which  his  appeal  against  order  passed  by  the 

learned Judge Family Court dated 12.01.2021 

was dismissed on the grounds of limitation. 

2.    The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  submitted  that  the  appeal  has  been 

dismissed on the grounds of limitation without 

taking 

into  account  Section  12  of 

the 

Limitation  Act,  1908  (“Act”).  He  has 

submitted  that  the 

impugned  order  was 

passed  on  12.01.2021  and  the  petitioner 

applied  for  a  copy  of  the  said  order  on 

18.01.2021,  which  was  prepared  and  handed 

over  to  him  on  27.01.2021.  He  has  further 

submitted that in view of Section 12 of the Act 

nine days are to be excluded in calculating the 

limitation  period.  The  statutory  period  for 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   -2-              W.P. No.3251/2021 

filing  of  the  appeal  after  exclusion  of  the  said 

period  would  have  been  extended 

till 

20.02.2021  and  the  appeal  was  filed  on 

16.02.2021  and  was  consequently  within  the 

period  of  limitation.  He  has  further  submitted 

that 

this 

Court 

through 

Notification 

No.F.(01)/Genl/IHC/9770  dated  30.09.2021 

has clarified that limitation period for purposes 

of  Section  12  of  the  Act  could  not  be  taken 

into  account  for  purposes  of  filing  any  suit, 

petition  and  appeal  etc.  from  24.03.2020  to 

30.09.2021 in view of the emergency situation 

that  has  emerged  due  to  Covid-19.  He  has 

relied  on  this  notification  and  submitted  that 

the  appeal  ought  to  have  been  heard  on  its 

merits,  even  if  it  was  beyond  the  limitation 

period as held by the learned appellate Court. 

3.    The learned counsel for respondent No.3 

has  stated  that  the  appeal  was  filed  on 

16.02.2021 alongwith a copy of the impugned 

order, which reflected that the said order  had 

been  applied 

for  and  copy  received  on 

16.02.2021 and in view of such facts that the 

impugned order was passed. 

4.    Through  notification  dated  30.09.2021 

this  Court  affirmed  that  an  exception  to  the 

ground  of  limitation  had  been  created  for  a 

period starting on 24.03.2020 and expiring on 

 
 
 
 
 
 
   -3-              W.P. No.3251/2021 

30.09.2021 

to  cope  with 

the  emerging 

situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic 

and  ensure  that  delay  in  assertion  of  legal 

rights  due  to  the  pandemic  does  not  result  in 

defeating  the  valuable  rights  of  citizens.  The 

benefit of such notification has to be extended 

fairly  and  evenly  to  all  litigants  in  view  of 

Article  4  of  the  Constitution  which  affords 

equal  protection  of  law  to  all  citizens.  Given 

that the appeal was filed within the period for 

which limitation has admittedly been excluded 

under  the  notification  of  this  Court,  the 

learned  appellate  Court  ought  to  have  heard 

the appeal on merits. 

5.    In  view  of  the  above,  this  petition  is 

allowed  and  the  impugned  judgment  dated 

12.07.2021  is  set-aside.  The  appeal  filed  by 

the  petitioner  will  be  deemed  pending  before 

the  learned  Additional  District  Court  (West), 

Islamabad. The parties are directed to appear 

before  the  learned  Additional  District  Court 

(West),  Islamabad  on  22.11.2021.  Given  that 

this is a family matter, this Court expects that 

the  learned  Additional  District  Court  (West), 

Islamabad will  decide the matter  with  alacrity 

within a period of 30-days.
