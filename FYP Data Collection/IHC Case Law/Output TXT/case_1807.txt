Proceeding

Date  of
hearine

Order with  signature  of Judge,  and  that  of parties  or counsel,
where  necessary.

12.9.2019. Malik Jawwad Khalid,  Advocate for petitioner.

The petitioner,  through  the instant  petition  has prayed for

quashing of FIR No.359/2016  dated 28.12.2016  under Sections

392, 342, I 48, I 49, 354,  448, 506(ii) PPC  PS Shalimar,  Islamabad.

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, interalia contends  that

instant FIR has been lodged  to settle  the family dispute  of the

property and as such no incident took place as alleged in the FIR. It

is further  contended that criminal complaint  titled  Hassan Ashfaq

Bhatti VS Col.Haroon  Rasheed  etc was also filed which  was

dismissed  vide order dated  10.5.2015  by the Additional Sessions

Judge-V  (West),  Islamabad  qua  the similar  subject matter  and  as

such  civil suit titled Hassan  Ashfaq  Bhatti etc VS Mr.Romail  etc

is pending before the competent  civil court  whereby the plaintiffs

are seeking  declaration and possession  of house No.l66-B,  Sector

F-l l/1, Islamabad.  Instant FIR is registered  with malafide to settle

the civil  dispute through  criminal  prosecution.

3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner has been confronted

regarding the status of a criminal  case whereby  he conceded that

challan  has been submitted  in the Court on 30.10.2018 whereby

petitioner has been placed in column No.2 of the report uls 173

Cr.P.C.

4. 

Keeping  in view the above background when challan  has

already  been submitted  in the competent  court, any interference  by

the High Court  through  a Constitutional  jurisdiction for quashing

of FIR amounts to bypass the statutory  remedies provided in

terms of Section  249-A Cr.P.C and 265-K  Cr.P.C which  are

available  to the petitioner. Reliance  is placed  on case law titled

Dr.Sher  Afean Khan Niazi VS Ali S.Habib  and others (2011

SCMR  1813) and Directorate  General.  Anti'Corruotion

Establishment.  Lahore and others VS Muhammad  Akram

Khan and others (PLD 2013  Supreme Court 401).  Even

otherwise  inherent jurisdiction of the High Cotrt in terms of

Criminal Procedure Code can only be exercised when  altemate  and

efficacious  remedy is not available or where the very registration

of the FIR is silent  qua any offence and as such petitioner has

failed  to stretch his case  under  the said principle,  therefore, instant

petition  is misconceived  and  same is hereby  dismissed in limine.
