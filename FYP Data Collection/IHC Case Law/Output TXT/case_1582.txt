No.513/2012,

Ex-parte.

12.08.2020.

Through the instant  intra court appeal,

t Authority (CDA/appellant) has assailed  the order  of

Judge in Chambers, dated 04.05.2012, passed in W.P
whereby the said writ petition filed by Maskeen  Sultan

(Respondent)

allowed and the appellant  was directed  to allot a plot to said

respondent  in

of his acquired  built-up property (BUP)  measuring  293  sq. ft.

2.  Brief

referred  in the instant appeal  are that the respondent  has filed

W.P. No.513/

2 with the contention that he is a sole iegal heir of Sikantlar

Khan son of

resident  of village  Chahan,  Islamabad,  who owned  a house in

village

measuring  293  sq. ft. At the time of acquisition  of said property

by the CDA

03.05.1963,  vide BUP No.58, the subject properg was acquired in

the name of

pondent and was included in list at Serial No.54 of the Award

The

t has filed several  applications  to the CDA for allotment of plot

against  his

on of built-up  property, including  the required fee of

Rs.200/-,

had also served  several reminders/notices.  Finally,  the respondent

received

dated 20.06.2012  informing him that the CDA  constituted

Allotment Scrutiny  Committee to resoive the pending  cases of affectees under

the Islamabad  Displaced Persons  Rehabilitation  Policy, 1996  (hereinafter  referrecl  to

as Rehabilitation  Policy).  The case of respondent  was placed before said

Committee  on 13.08.2005,  but same  was rejected having not been covered under

ICA  No.277  /2012

Pase | 2

the Rehabilitation  Policy, 7996. Accordingly, the respondent approached  this

Court by filing a writ petition  for redressal  of his grievance,  which  was allowed

by the learned Single  Judge in Chambers  vide impugned order  dated  04.05.2012.

Hence,  this intra court  appeal.

3. 

Learned  counsel for appellant contends that respondent's  case does  not

fall within the rehabilitation  policy  as his father had already received  the

rehabilitation benefit vide Eligibility  Certificate No.B002231,  dated 08.03.1966,  for

District  Multan  for allotment of 100 Kanal agricultural  land against  his acquired

land of 9l--Kanals  & 6-Marlas from village Chahary  Islamabad;  that the appellant

is otherwise not eligible  under  the Policy as his BUP is less than 300 sq. ft., which

is not covered under the poticy domain for allotment of plo! even when one of

the family  member has already received  rehabilitation benefit  same could not be

extended to dependent  family member; that case  of respondent was rejected  on

13.08.2005,  but writ petition  was filed with delay in the year  2012, but this aspect

has not been  considered by learned Single ]udge in Chambers  while passing the

impugned  order, which is in violation  of the policy as well as of the law.

4.  On the other  hand, the respondent was served  notices  and in response to

notice,  Mr. Ali Murad,  Advocate  put appearance  on19.09.20L2, though replaced

by Ch. Naeem  Ali Gujjar,  Advocate, who appeared  on 04.03.20L3  and  30.05.2013,

whereas respondent  also appeared in-person  on 01.06.2015 and 23.01'.2020, but

later  on no one put appearance  despite fixation of the case  on 13.02.2020.  Mr.

Shafaqat  Mehmood, Advocate  again  appeared as proxy counsel on 08.06.2020,

whereafter on 06.07  .2020 notice  perai was issued  for 16.07.2020,  on which date the

respondent  again absented constraining the Court to issue yet another notice

perai. However, despite hectic efforts  no one put appearance in this case on

behalf  of respondent, even name of learned  counsel for respondent was reflected

in cause list as his power of attorney  is still intact and available on record,

therefore,  there is no other option but to proceed against the respondent ex-parte.

However,  his point of view has been taken into consideration from available

record  of writ petition as well as record  appended with this appeal for the just

decision  of the case.

5. 

Arguments  heard,  record  perused.

6.  Perusal of record  reveals that the Capital Development  Authority is

mainly  aggrieved with the order  of the learned  Single Judge in Chambers,  dated

04.05.2012,  passed in W.P. No.513/20L2, whereby  direction was issued  for

allotment  of plot under the Rehabilitation  Policy against the respondent's

acquired BUP of 293 sq. ft. In order  to resolve  the controversy  the admitted  facts

reflected  from the record are as under:

a)  BUP measuring 293  sq. ft. was  acquired  by the CDA vide award

dated 03.05.1963,  through  BUP No.58 in village Chahan,  Islamabad

and name of respondent is reflected  at Serial No.54 of award list.

b)  The respondent  has received  the acquisition  benefit of Rs.1043/-

against  acquisition  of 293  sq. ft. of land.

c)  Respondent's father  i.e. Sikandar, resident  of village Chaharu

Islamabad  was given Eligibility Certificate  No.C001026 for L2-Acres

and 4-Kanals  of land equal to 100-Kanals  in District Multan vide

eligibility  certificate dated  17 .11..1966.

7.  While considering the above admitted  f.acts, we have  gone through  the

Rehabilitation  Policy notified by the CDA and observed that benefit for a

BUP/land  in terms of Section  4 is provided in the following manner:

4.

Allotment  of resiilential  plots. The  residential plots shall  be allotted  to
the ffictee  according to the follotoing scale  namely:
(1)  IMere  the land acquired  is zuith or uithout  built up property

thereon and the area  of land acquired  is--
(a)  4 Kanals or More but less =  A plot of 25x50 size.

than 10 Kanals
@)  10 Kanals  or more. 

=  A plot of 30x60  size for
eoery  complcte  unit of 1.0
Kanals of acquired  land.

ICANo.277/2072

Page | 4

Prooided  that  uthere  the land ncquires  is less thnn 4 Kanals,  the ffictee
will be allowed to join other ffictees to make up the deficiency in the
minimum  area of 04 knnals to be eligible for joint allotment  of a plot.
(2)  lMere  built up property  is acquired  in Abadi Deh, residcntial plots
will be allotted to the ffictees nofiuithstanding  the ownership of the land
beneath  the Where built up property on the following criteria:-

Area of BUP
n 
300 to 499  Square  feet
ii)  500 Square  feet and

upwards.

Plot Size
Plot of 25'x50'
Plot of 30'x60'

The allotment will, houteaer, be subject to the condition  that the ffictee
has not aaailed any benefit against  acquisition of land, if any, acquired
from him, proaided  that where the acquired built up property is located
outside Abadi Deh, residential  plots will be allotted to the ffictee of the
built up proper$, as in the case of Abadi Deh, only if the land  beneath  is
ounedby the affectee  himself."

8. 

Besides the above referred  provision for eligibility  benefit for allotment  of

residential plot, the policy  has also notified  conditions  in general,  whereby  a

restriction  has been imposed upon the benefits  in Section 8 of the Rehabilitation

Policy,  which is as under:

8.  Conditions  in general. (1) Allotment of residential  plots,
agriculture land or agro-farm  shall be subject  to prior submission  of an
ffidaoit to the ,fftrt that  no member  of the family unit of the ffictee owns
a plot or house in lslamabad or has already aoniled of any rehabilitation
benefit from the CDA. This ffidaoit  tuill be further  subject  to the Scrutiny
of and acceptance by the CDA. Any false ffidaoit utill render  the
executants  of that ffidaait  disqualifud  for any rehabilitation  benefit from
the CDA for all times and if any allotment has been  made, it will render
that allotment  liable to be cancelled  eaen if construction has been raised
thereon and the amount  already  paid touards  its price  liable to be

forfeited,'

9.  We have  gone through the above mentioned  policy with able assistance of

learned counsel  for appellant. As per record the built-up  property of the

respondent is less than 300 sq. ft., which  is the minimum  requirement  for

allotment  of plot measuring 25x50 in terms of Section  aQ) of the said Policy

Similarly, Section 8(1) of the policy  imposes  restriction that, "no member of family

unit of the ffictee oltns a plot or house in Islamabad  or has already  aaailed of any

ICA No.277/2012

rehabilitation  benefit  from the CDA" As such, resPondent's  father  has already

availed rehabilitation  benefit  through Eligibility  Certificate  No.C001026,  dated

17.1'J,.1966,  for land measuring L2-Acres  & 4-Kanals in District Multan.

10.  In view of above positiory the learned Single  Judge in Chambers  has not

properly  attended  to the proposition,  rather gone beyond his jurisdiction while

passing direction  for the purpose of allotment.

11.  The relief  claimed by the respondent  in writ petition  is not made out,

whereas  one of the case relied upon  by respondent in the writ petition  wasW.P.

No.L52lp.006 (Abdul labbar  as. CDA),  but said  case is different in nature  as to the

case in hand,  as in the said case  family members  were not awarded  land under

the Rehabilitation  Policy  and  as such, their  own BUP has been acquired, against

which the petitioner  (Abdul  Jabbar)  was claiming benefit, which was allowed  by

the then Hon'ble Chief Justice of this Court, vide order  dated 13.05.2007,

therefore,  said orderf case  having  diverse facts and circumstances  could not be

considered  to mull over  the instant case.

12.  Keeping  in view  the position, the learned Single )udge in Chambers has

not considered  the law as well as the Rehabilitation  Policy in its true  perspective,

whereby  ineligibility of respondent was ignored despite clear mentioning of

restrictions  in Sections  4 and 8(1) of the Rehabilitation Policy, 1966, hence,  the

instant intra court appeal  is hereby ALLOWED  and impugned  order dated

04.05.2012 is SETASIDE.  No order as to cost
