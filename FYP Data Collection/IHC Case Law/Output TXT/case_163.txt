Main Case.  

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed 

under Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic 

Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed 

judgments  and  decrees  dated 

17.07.2014 and 09.07.2013, passed by learned 

Additional  District  &  Sessions  Judge-V,  West-

Islamabad  and  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

Islamabad, respectively, whereby the suit filed 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
2 

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

by  the  petitioner  was  partially  decreed  to  the 

extent of dowry articles admitted by defendant 

/  respondent  No.  3  to  be  laying  in  his 

possession  and 

rest  of 

the  claim  was 

dismissed,  thereafter,  the  petitioner  filed  an 

appeal, which was also dismissed. 

02. 

Succinctly  stated,  facts  of  the  case  are 

that the petitioner and respondent No. 3 were 

married  on  15.01.1984,  according  to  Muslim 

Rites and  ceremonies against a prompt dower 

of  an  amount  of  Rs.  100/-,  Nikah  was 

registered  in  Kamalia  and  Rukhasti  took  place 

on  11.04.1987.  Thereafter  both  the  parties 

started 

living  as  husband  and  wife 

in 

accordance  with  the  injunctions  of  Islam. 

Subsequently, differences cropped up between 

the  parties,  resultantly,  respondent  No.  3 

threw her out from his abode. On 02.03.1998, 

the respondent No. 3 pronounced a divorce to 

petitioner,  whereafter  she  filed  a  suit  for 

recovery,  which  was  partially  decreed  vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated  09.07.2013, 

passed  by 

learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

Islamabad, being aggrieved the petitioner filed 

an  appeal  against  the  said  judgment  and 

decree,  which  was  also  dismissed  vide 

judgment  and  decree  dated  17.07.2014, 

passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  & 

Sessions  Judge-V,  West-Islamabad,  hence  the 

instant writ petition. 

03.  Notices  were  issued  to  the  respondent 

No.  3  but  the  same  were  not  served.  On 

14.11.2022,  it  was  ordered  by  this  Court  to 

serve  the  notice  upon  respondent  No.  3 

through  publication  in  “Daily  Jang”  Lahore, 

however  on  next  date  of  hearing 

i.e. 

11.01.2023,  no  one  was  in  attendance  on 

behalf of respondent No. 3, therefore, he was 

proceeded against ex-parte.  

04. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia,  contends 

that  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  have  been  passed  in 

violation  of  law  and  dictums  laid  down  by  the 

Superior  Courts  of  the  country;  the  petitioner 

has submitted sufficient evidence in support of 

her contentions; both the impugned judgments 

 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

and decrees have been passed on mis-reading 

and  non-reading of  evidence,  hence  the  same 

are liable to be set-aside.  

05.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

06. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed  to  point  out  any 

illegality 

in  the 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees.  It  is  well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of  law.  It  will 

also  be 

issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts without  jurisdiction or in  excess 

of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise  its 

jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a  tribunal 

acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a  matter 

in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural  justice. 

The  High  Court  while  issuing  a  writ  of 

certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of  supervisory  and 

not  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in 

exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not review 

the  findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal.

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

07. 

In  this  regard,  reliance  is  placed  upon 

following  dictums  /  law  laid  down  by  the 

Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan:  

i.  Amjad  Khan  VS  Muhammad 

Irshad  (Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155). 

ii.  President All Pakistan Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and others 

(2020 SCMR 260). 

iii.  Chief  Executive  MEPCO  and 

others  VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others (2019 SCMR 919). 

iv.  Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad 

Usman and others (PLD 2018 SC 28). 

v.  Shajar  Islam  VS  Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 SC 

45). 

08. 

Further, there are concurrent findings of 

both  the  learned  Courts  below  against  the 

petitioner. In case of concurrent findings of the 

courts  below,  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

has failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading of the evidence. It has been laid down 

in  a  case  titled  as  Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS 

Abdul Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others 

(2008 YLR 2309) that: 

"When there are concurrent findings 

of Courts below, the scope of the 

constitutional 

petition 

for 

interference is very limited and it can 

only be interfered when the orders of 

the  Courts  below  are  fanciful  or 

based on misreading or non-reading 

of the evidence". 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  the  cases  titled  as 

Khuda  Bukhsh  VS  Muhammad  Sharif 

and  another  (1974  SCMR  279)  and 

Sadruddin  VS  Aslam  Madad  Ali  and 

others (PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

09. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  dated 

17.07.2014 and 09.07.2013, passed by learned 

Additional  District  &  Sessions  Judge-V,  West-

Islamabad and Judge Family Court Islamabad, 

respectively,  are  in  accordance  with  law  and 

 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 530 of 2015 

facts  of  the  matter,  hence  do  not  require  any 

interference by this Court. 

10. 

In  view  of  above  prospective,  instant 

writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the  same  is 

dismissed with no order as to costs.
