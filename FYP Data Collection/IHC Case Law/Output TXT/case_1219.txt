order/ 
Proceedings 
15.07.2021  Mr.  Salman  Yousaf  Khan,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioners. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioners  have  challenged  order  dated 

04.11.2020,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-III / Guardian Judge, West-Islamabad, 

whereby  interim  maintenance  of  minor  was 

fixed at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month. 

2. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

petitioners, 

inter-alia, 

contends 

that 

respondent  No.1  is  a  doctor  by  profession 

working  at  Safari  Hospital,  Bahria  Town, 

Rawalpindi, whereas the minor is studying in 

Headstart  School,  Islamabad  and  petitioner 

No.1 has meet the monthly expenses  of the 

minor  more 

than  Rs.25,000/-. 

It 

is 

appropriate 

that 

interim  maintenance 

allowance  of  the  minor  be  enhanced  from 

Rs.10,000/-  to  Rs.200,000/-  per  month, 

hence the impugned order is liable to be set-

aside.
