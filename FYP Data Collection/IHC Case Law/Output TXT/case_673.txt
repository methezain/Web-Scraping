Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

3. 

It  is  alleged  that  the  petitioners  have 

forcibly  abducted  the  minor  Ahmad  Ali  aged 

about 08 years from his school on gun point 

in  a  black  coloured  car,  hence  the  instant 

FIR. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners, 

inter alia, contends  that  there  is  a  family 

dispute  between  the  parties;  the  petitioner 

Yasir  Hafeez 

is  uncle  and  Muhammad 

Shafique  is  cousin  of  the  minor;  they  have 

not  committed  any  offence;  case  has  been 

registered  with  malafide 

intentions  and 

ulterior  motives  just  in  order  to  settle  the 

score  of  family  litigation;  the  minor  is  in 

custody  of  his  mother;  no  recovery  is  to  be 

effected from them, hence the petitioners are 

entitled for grant of bail before arrest.  

5. 

Learned  State  counsel  assisted  by 

learned  counsel  for  the  complainant  states 

that the petitioners are specifically nominated 

in  the  FIR;  there  is  sufficient  evidence 

available  against  them;  they  have  abducted 

the  minor  as  the  matter  for  his  custody  was 

 
 
3 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

pending  in  the  learned  Family  Court,  so,  the 

petitioners  /  accused  just  in  order  to  avoid 

the  delay  in  decisions  of  Family  Court  have 

committed 

instant 

crime  and 

forcibly 

abducted  the  minor  and  deprived  the  father 

and  grand-father  from  lawful  custody  of 

minor,  hence  the  petitioners  are  not  entitled 

for grant of bail before arrest.   

6. 

Arguments 

advanced 

by 

learned 

counsel for the parties, learned State Counsel 

have  been  heard  and  record  has  been 

perused with their able assistance.  

7. 

The 

petitioners 

are 

specifically 

nominated  in  the  FIR;  on  the  complaint  of 

grand-father  of  the  minor,  FIR  has  been 

registered; 

police 

has 

also 

recorded 

statement  of  one  Qari  Ameer  who  is  eye-

witness  of  the  occurrence;  statement  of 

principal  of  school  has  also  recorded  by  the 

police who has stated that the minor was got 

admitted  in  school  by  his  father  /  grand-

father  and  they  were  paying  dues/fees  etc 

and were dropping and picking up the minor 

 
 
 
4 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

regularly  from  the  school;  police  has  also 

taken  into  possession  the  school  admission 

form of the minor which indicates that he was 

admitted in the school by his father / grand-

father;  the  principal  has  further  stated  in  his 

statement that on the date of occurrence the 

minor  was  brought  in  school  by  his  grand-

father, whereas, security guard has stated in 

his  statement  recorded  u/s  161  Cr.P.C.  that 

on  the  date  of  occurrence,  the  minor  was 

kidnapped  by  the  accused  in  a  black  car 

forcibly from outside the school.  

8.  Mother  of  the  minor  has  got  recorded 

her  statement  in  the  Court  of  Malik  Zafar 

Iqbal, Judge Family Court, Pindigheb (Attock) 

on 12.07.2021, that the minor is in custody of 

his father; the petition filed by the mother u/s 

491 Cr.P.C. was also dismissed on 19.07.2021 

by  the  Court  of  learned  Additional  Sessions 

Judge,  Islamabad  on  the  ground  that  the 

minor was in custody of his father.  

9. 

Said judicial record clearly indicates that 

the  minor  was  in  custody  of  his  father;  he 

 
 
5 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

was  admitted  in  school  by  his  father  and  all 

the dues/fees etc., picking and dropping from 

the  school  was  done  by  his  father  /  grand- 

father.   

10.  Though  the  minor  is  in  custody  of  his 

mother  but  the  practice  of  kidnapping  and 

snatching  the  minor  forcibly  by  relatives 

cannot be allowed as law clearly provides the 

mechanism for getting custody of the minors 

through  the  Courts  of  law  and  if  this  act  of 

kidnapping  is  encouraged  then  everyone  will 

take law in his/her hands and people will not 

approach  the  Courts  for  redressal  of  their 

grievances.  

11. 

I.O  present  in  the  Court  states  that  he 

has 

conducted 

thorough 

investigation, 

recorded  statements  of  the  eye-witnesses  as 

well  as  enquired  from  other  persons  who 

were  present  at  the  spot  but  did  not  opt  to 

record  their  statement  under  section  161 

Cr.P.C.  and  as  per  opinion  of  the  I.O,  the 

petitioners / accused are very well involved in 

the commission of crime. I.O has stated that 

 
 
6 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

he  needs  custody  of  the  petitioners/accused 

for  effecting  recovery  of  weapons  and  other 

incriminating evidence.   

12. 

It  is  well  settled  principle  of  law  that 

while  deciding  the  bail  application,  before 

recording  of  evidence  in  the  trial  Court,  only 

tentative  assessment  is  to  be  made  by  the 

Court  and  it  is  not  permissible  to  go  into 

details  of  evidence  in  one  way  or  the  other 

that might prejudice the case of either party. 

In  this  regard  reliance  is  placed  upon  “PLD 

1994  Supreme  Court  65,  PLD  1994 

Supreme Court 88, 2021 SCMR 111 and  

2020 SCMR 937”. 

13.  Bail before arrest cannot be claimed as 

a matter of legal right in each case and also it 

cannot be expected that it would be granted 

in  each  case  unless  legal  requirements  laid 

down  are  met.  It  is  to  be  kept  in  view  that 

bail  granted  before  arrest,  causes  setback  in 

investigation  and  can  stand  as  stumbling 

block  in  the  way of  recovery of  incriminating 

articles. Reliance is placed on a case titled as 

 
 
7 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

“Waleed  Arfaqat  VS  The  State  and 

another” (2021 MLD 1226). 

14. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan  in a case titled as 

“Sarwar  Sultan  VS  The  State”  (PLD 

1994 Supreme Court 133), that: 

“Grant of pre-arrest bail means 

that accused is exempted from 

joining the investigation and by 

not  joining  the  investigation, 

prosecution case may suffer for 

want 

of 

recovery 

of 

incriminating articles and other 

material,  which  may  be 

necessary  to  connect  the 

accused  with  commission  of 

alleged crime”. 

15.      It  is  well  settled  law  that  relief  of  pre- 

arrest  bail  is  granted  only  in  those  matters 

where  it  would  appear  that  registration  of 

such  cases  was  passed  on  enmity  /  malafide 

or where no offence was shown to have been 

committed  on  the very  face of  record.  This  is 

not the position in the instant case. Reliance is 

placed  upon  cases  reported  as  “PLD 1983 

Supreme Court 82, 1996 SCMR 74, 1996 

 
 
 
8 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

SCMR 71 and 2019 SCMR 1129. 

16.    In the recent order passed by Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 

“Kamran Attaullah and another VS The 

State passed in Criminal Petition No. 

149-K of 2020”, it is held that: 

“It is by now well settled that 

the accused in a criminal case 

cannot be granted anticipatory 

bail  to  subvert  or  undermine 

investigative procedure / process 

that essentially include arrest in 

order  to  bring  the  statutory 

exercise to its logical end for 

effective  and  meaningful 

prosecution  of  the  offence 

through 

collection 

of 

information 

/ 

evidence 

consequent  upon  arrest. 

Malafide,  manifestly  intriguing 

upon the intended arrest, is the 

only justification to suspend or 

divert the usual course of law, a 

step most extraordinary by all 

means”. 

17.        There  can  be  no  escape  from  the  fact 

that  the  petitioners  /  accused  are  nominated 

in  the  FIR  as  well  as  in  the  statement  of 

witnesses  recorded  by 

the  police  under 

 
 
 
9 

Crl. Misc. No.1381-B of 2021 

Section  161  Cr.P.C.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners  /  accused  have  not  shown  any 

malafide against the complainant or police for 

registration  of  instant  FIR.  Custody  of  the 

petitioners  /  accused  is  required  for  the 

purpose  of  recovery  and  investigation.  There 

is  sufficient  evidence  available  on  record  to 

connect  the  petitioners  /  accused  with  the 

commission of crime. 

18.  Considering 

the  above 

facts  and 

circumstances, I am clear in my mind that the 

petitioners  /  accused  have  failed  to  make  out 

a 

case 

for  grant  of  pre-arrest  bail. 

Consequently, 

instant  bail  petition  stands 

dismissed. Ad- interim pre-arrest bail already 

granted  to  the  petitioners  /  accused  dated 

23.12.2021,  passed  by  this  Court  are  hereby 

recalled. 

19.  Needless  to  mention  that,  this  is  a 

tentative  assessment  which  shall  not  affect 

the trial of case in any manner.
