Proceedings 
29.09.2021   Mr. Kamran Yousaf Kiani, Advocate for petitioner. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties 
or counsel where necessary.  

Through the instant writ petition, the petitioner 

has  assailed  the  order  dated  14.07.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West),  Islamabad, 

whereby,  appeal 

filed  by  the  petitioner  has  been 

dismissed in limine being time bared . 

2.   

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  inter-alia 

contends  that  respondent  No.  1  had  filed  Suit  for 

Recovery  of  Maintenance,  Dowry  Articles  and  Gold 

Ornaments,  which  was  partly  allowed  in  her  favour  by 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  (West),  Islamabad  through 

ex-parte 

judgment  and  decree  dated  18.01.2021, 

whereby,  notices  have  not  been  served  upon  the 

petitioner. He further contends that respondent No.1 filed 

another suit for enhancement of maintenance and claimed 

the dowry article/gold ornaments, whereby, the petitioner 

has  received  the  notice  and  has  put  appearance  before 

the  learned  Family  Court,  whereby,  he  has  filed  his  own 

appeal  in  terms  of  Section  14  of  the  Family Court Act, 

1964,  but  the  learned  Trial  Court  has  passed  the 

impugned order in haste without considering the merits of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  case,  even  though  application  for  condonation  of 

delay has also been filed. 

3.

Question raised needs consideration. 

Let  notice  be  issued  to  respondent  No.1  for
