17.02.2022  Sardar Bilal Firdous, Advocate: 

The  instant  writ  petition  is  arising  out  of 

order  dated  10.01.2022,  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court,  West-Islamabad,  whereby 

interim  maintenance  to  the  tune  of  Rs.  30,000/- 

for  respondent  No.2,  Rs.15,000/-  for  respondent 

No.3,  Rs.20,000/-  for  respondent  No.4  and 

Rs.10,000/- for respondent No.1, was fixed.  

2-  

Precisely, 

relevant 

facts  are 

that 

respondents  1  to  4  filed  suit  for  recovery  of 

maintenance 

against 

the 

petitioner 

on 

04.09.2021.  The  latter  contested  the  suit  by 

filing  written  statement.  The  learned  Trial  Court 

after  hearing 

the  parties, 

fixed 

interim 

maintenance  in  terms  noted  in  Para-1  above. 

Hence, instant writ petition. 

3-  

Learned 

counsel  argues 

that 

the 

quantum  of  interim  maintenance  determined  by 

the  learned  Trial  Court  is  not  only  excessive  but 

also  against  the  financial  status  of  the  petitioner 

and  the  law  on  the  subject.  Learned  counsel 

relied  upon  case  laws  reported  as  PLD  2009  SC 

760, 2012 YLR 1214, 2007 MLD 41 and 1994 CLC 

1216.

Arguments heard. Record perused.  

5-  

Under  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964  (Act  of  1964),  family 

court is competent to fix interim maintenance and 

remedy  of  appeal  or  revision  against  the  interim 

order is barred in terms of Section 14 of the West 

Pakistan  Family Courts Act 1964 which stipulates 

that:-  

“No  appeal  or  revision  shall  lie  against  an 
interim order passed by a Family Court.” 

6- 

The Act of 1964, being a special law, bars 

remedy  of  appeal  or  revision  against  interim 

order,  therefore,  when  a  statute  specifically 

excludes  a  remedy,  petition  in  terms  of  Article 

199  of  the  Constitution  cannot  be  held  to  be 

maintainable  against  the  said  order  as  it  would 

amount  to  circumvent  the  intention  of  the 

legislature and frustrate the express provision of 

law.  

7- 

This  Court  in  the  case  of  “Dr.  Aqueel 

Waris v. Ibrahim Aqueel Waris” (2020 CLC 131-

Islamabad),  after  surveying  case  law  on  the 

subject  has  held  that  “While  considering  the 

above  discussion,  interlocutory  orders  of  the 

Judge  Family  Court  could  not  be  assailed  in 

constitutional  jurisdiction,  even  though  in  some 

of cases they are harsh, but the determination of 

adequacy  or  inadequacy  of  the  quantum  of 

maintenance  would  certainly  require 

factual 

evidence or inquiry which cannot be made in the 

proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution 

of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, as held 

in  2018  CLC  Note  43  (Shameneh  Haider  and

Lahore (Aamir  Mehmood Hussain v.  Niha Aamir 

Saeed),  2015  YLR  2364  (Tahir  Ayub  Khan  v. 

Miss  Aalia  Anwar),  PLD  2012  Lahore  420 

(Ibrar Hussain v. Mehwish Rana and others), and 

PLD  2013  Lahore  64  (Muhammad  Shahbaz 

Khalid v. Judge Family Court Lahore).”  

8- 

The  Hon’ble  Lahore  High  Court  in  the 

case of “Dr. Samina Anayat v. Additional District 

Judge  and  others”  (2018  MLD  448  Lahore), 

has held that:- 

the 

legislation  and 

“Perusal of section 14(3) of West Pakistan 
Family  Court  Act,  1964,  shows  that  no 
appeal  or  revision  shall  lie  against  an 
interim  order  passed  by  a  Family  Court. 
The  Act  has  explicitly  barred  the  remedy 
of  appeal  or  revision  against  such  an 
order,  therefore,  in  case  a  constitutional 
petition  is  entertained  against  such  an 
order,  it  will  amount  to  circumvent  the 
intention  of 
to 
frustrate  the  express  provision  of  law. 
Reliance  in  this  respect  is  placed  upon 
Muhammad  Anwar  Khan  v.  Mst.  Yasmin 
Zafar  (1987  SCMR 2029),  Ms.  Quratulain 
Aleem  v.  Muhammad  Rehman  Khan  and 
another  (2006  YLR  2604)  and  Mst.  Noor 
v. 
Tasleem 
Jehan 
Muhammad  Arshad  and  another  (1986 
CLC 442). Since the impugned order is an 
interlocutory  order  and  against  such  an 
order constitution petition cannot be filed, 
therefore, the petition before this Court is 
not  maintainable.  The  learned  Additional 
District Judge has rightly observed in the 
appeal  that  appeal  or  revision  against 
not 
interlocutory 
maintainable.”

9- 

Even  otherwise,  it  emerges  from  the 

record  that  the  petitioner  is  an  Officer  of  BS-17 

in  the  Federal  Government  while  respondents  2 

to  4  are  studying  in  A-level,  F.Sc  and  class-VI 

respectively.  In  the  attending  circumstances  of 

the  case,  the  quantum  of  interim  maintenance 

as determined by the learned Trial Court, cannot 

be  termed  as  excessive  or  that  the  same  does 

not  commensurate  the  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner  who,  otherwise,  being  real  father  is 

under obligation to maintain respondent 2 to 4.  

10- 

The  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned 

counsel for the petitioner do not extend any help 

to the petitioner due to having distinct facts and 

circumstances.  

11- 

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ  petition 

assailing  interim  order  of  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court 

is  not  maintainable. 

It 

is 

accordingly dismissed in limine.
