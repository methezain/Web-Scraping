Order with  signature of  Judge and that 
of parties or counsel where necessary. 

Syed  Zawed  ul  Hassan  Najam,  Advocate  for 
the  Petitioner. 

Through 

the 

instant  petition, 

the 

petitioner 

has 

impugned 

order 

dated 

19.01.2022,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-III  (Guardian Judge),  West-Islamabad, 

whereby, application filed  by the  petitioner for 

submitting  evidence 

I 

record  of  SMS 

messages and  application  to  Rescue-15 was 

dismissed with  cost of  Rs.  5,000/- 

02.  Learned counsel for  the  petitioner,  inter 

alia/  contends  that  impugned  order  has  not 

been  passed  by 

learned 

trial  Court 

in 

accordance with  law and dictum  laid  down  by 

the  superior  courts  of  the  country  and  the 

impugned  order  is  erroneous,  hence liable to 

be set aside.

03.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

04.  Admittedly, 

the  petitioner  contracted 

marriage  with  respondent  No.2;  respondent 

No.2 being legally wedded wife  filed  a  suit for 

recovery  of  dower,  dowry  articles  including 

jewelry  and  maintenance.  The  suit  was 

contested by the  petitioner;  written  statement 

was filed;  issues  were  framed  by the  learned 

trial  Court;  evidence  of  both  the  parties  was 

recorded  and  the  case  was  fixed  for  final 

arguments. 

05. 

In 

the  meanwhile, 

the  petitioner 

submitted  an  application 

for  producing 

evidence  of  SMS  record  of  respondent  No.2 

alleging  that  his  ex-wife  /  respondent  No.2 

had extra  marital  relationship with  some other 

person  and  wanted  to  bring  copies  of  SMS 

messages on  record. 

06.  As  evidence  of  both  the  parties  has 

been recorded, the  matter  will  be  decided on 

the  basis  of  evidence  in  light  of  the  issues 

framed  by the  learned trial  Court.  Bringing on 

record  the  indecent  and  immoral  messages 

will  not  be  beneficial  / 

fruitful 

for 

the 

petitioner  rather  it  will  cause huge damage to 

3 

Writ Petition No. 464 0(2022 

respondent  No.2.  When  confronted,  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  not  produced 

any  judgment  /  law  on  the  subject  on  the 

basis of  which  he  claims that  impugned order 

be  set aside. 

07.  As 

the 

impugned  order 

is 

an 

interlocutory  /  interim  order,  it  is  mentioned 

in  Section 14(3) of the  West  Pakistan Family 

Courts Act,  1964 that: 

"No appeal  or  revision  shall  lie 

against 

an 

interim 

order 

passed by a Family 

Court." 

08. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of  Pakistan in  a  case  titled  as 

Syed  Saghir  Ahmad  Naqvi  VS  Province 

of Sindh (1996  SCMR 1165),  that: 

"The statute  excluding  a  right 

of appeal from  the  interim  order 

cannot  be  passed  by  bringing 

under  attack 

such 

interim 

orders 

in 

Constitutional 

jurisdiction.  The party  affected 

has to  wait  till  it  matures  into  a 

final  order  and  then  to  attack  it 

in  the  proper  exclusive  forum 

created 

for 

the  purpose  of 

examining  such orders."

Writ Petition No. 464 0(2022 

Reliance 

is  also  placed  on  cases 

reported as  1976 SCMR 450  & 2020 SCMR 

260. 

09.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed  to  point  out  as  to  how  the  impugned / 

interim  order  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court was the  consequence of an  error 

of  law  or  without  jurisdiction  or  in  excess  of 

jurisdiction. 

10. 

In  view  of 

the  above  prospective, 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is  dismissed  in limine.
