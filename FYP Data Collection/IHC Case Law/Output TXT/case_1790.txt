Proceedings
17.LO.2O19. Mr. Ghulam Qasim Bhatti, Advocate for

the Petitioner.

Through the instant Petition,  the
petitioner has  challenged order dated
tt.07 .20L9, whereby  right of evidence  of

petitioner  was closed

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner,

inter-alia,  contended that the petitioner filed  a

guardian  petition  before  respondent  No.1  with

respect to custody  of his minor children. In

the referred  proceedings without  any fault of

the petitioner, it is allegedtthat the right of

evidence was closed.

3

Arguments advanced  by learned

counsel for the petitioner have been heard
and the  documents Placed on  record

examined  with his able assistance.

4

It  is observed  that order ciated

11.07.20L9  was passed after providing  a

number of opportunities  to the petitioner. The

Wilt Petition No.357O  of 2079

proceedings are under the Guardian and

Wards Act and Code  of Civil Procedure  is not

applicable. Even otherwise,  no justification is

provided  for not leading the evidence  on the

date in question.  It is also settled  law that no

petition under Article  199 of the Constitution

can be filed against an interlocutory  order

unless the same is without jurisdiction  or

suffers from  different  illegalities,  the
impugned order under the  facts and

circumstances does not suffer from  such

disability  warranting interference.

5

For the above reasons, the instant

petition is without merit and is accordingly

dismissed in limine.
