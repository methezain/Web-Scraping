Rizwan Ullah Khalidi 

VS

Learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad (West) and 05 others. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
29.11.2021  Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Mr. Mudassar 

Hussain Malik, Advocates for the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  the  judgment  and 

decree  dated  13.10.2021,  passed  by 

respondent  No.1  as  well  as  consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated  28.05.2021, 

passed by respondent No.2. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends 

that 

learned  Judge 

Family Court / respondent No.2 has granted 

the relief to respondents No.3 to 6, wherein 

mother of the minors / respondent No.3 was 

held  entitled  for  past  maintenance  at  the 

rate  of  Rs.20,000/-,  whereas  respondent 

No.1  /  appellate  court  has  enhanced  the 

maintenance 

from 

Rs.20,000/- 

to 

Rs.40,000/-,  future  maintenance  of  each 

minor was granted at the rate of Rs.10,000/, 

and  respondent  No.1  has  enhanced  the 

same from Rs.10,000/- to Rs.50,000/- each, 

per month with 10% annual increase, future 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
maintenance  of  wife  i.e.  respondent  No.3 

was also fixed at the rate of Rs.20,000/- and 

respondent  No.1  has  enhanced  the  same  at 

the rate of Rs.50,000/- per month. The said 

enhancement  of 

the  amount 

is  very 

exorbitant  and  is  not  according  to  financial 

position  of  the  petitioner.  No  evidence  has 

been produced  before learned  trial Court  by 

the  respondents  that  petitioner  can  afford 

such  maintenance  of  the  huge  amount  to 

the  minors  and  his  wife,  impugned  orders 

are erroneous and are not tenable under the 

law,  hence  the  same  are  liable  to  be  set-

aside.   

3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice to the respondents.
