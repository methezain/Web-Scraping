Learned counsel for  the
that  the  visitation
schedule
fixed by the learned Courts below
too much time to be spend between
nt No.3 and petitioner  No.2; that the said
rrent orders ought to be modified so that

?

the visitation between respondent No.3  and
petitioner No.2 should take place in the Gourt
premises  only; and that a meeting between
respondent No.3 and petitioner No.2 should take
place only once or twice a month.
4. 
I am of the view that the contentions of the
learned  counsel for the petitioners  are untenable.
Since petitioner No.2's custody  is with petitioner
No.1, it is imperative that the bond  between
respondent No.3 (father) and petitioner  No.2
(daughter)  should develop and be strengthened.
5.  Since I  do not find any illegality  or
arbitrariness  in the visitation  schedule between
respondent  No.3 and petitioner  No.2 concurrently
fixed by the learned Courts  below, there is no
reason to  interfere in  the  impugned
judgments/orders.
6.  The petitioners  seek the issuance  of a writ
of certiorari with respect to the concurrent
judgments/orders  passed by the learned Courts
below. lt is well settled that certiorari is only
available to quash a decision for an error of law. lt
will also be issued for correcting errors of
jurisdiction  when an inferior Court or a Tribunal
acts without jurisdiction or in excess of ats
jurisdiction, or fails to exercise it or where the
Court or a Tribunal acts illegally  in exercise of its
undoubted jurisdiction when it decides  a matter  in
violation of the principle of natural justice. The
Court  issuing a writ of certiorari acts in exercise
of a supervisory  and not appellate  jurisdiction.  A
Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not
review findings of fact reached  by the inferior
Court or a tribunal.
7.  The learned counsel for the petitioners
made no submission on the point as to how the
concurrent  judgments/orders  passed by the

Courts below were the consequence of
r of law or were without jurisdiction  or in

t has become common for counsel to argue
seeking the issuance of writs of
as if they are arguing an appeal. This
must be stopped,  as the same is not in
ance with the well settled principles for
and deciding petitions  seeking the
of writs of certiorari.

Finding  no jurisdictional  infirmity in the
judgments/orders  passed bY the
Courts below, the instant petitbn is
