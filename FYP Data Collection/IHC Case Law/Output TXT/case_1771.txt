13,11.2019. Mr. Shafqat  Abbas  Tarar, Advocate  for the

petitioner.

The petitioner, in the instant petition,

has assailed  order dated 29.04.2019,  whereby

the interim  maintenance  was fixed by learned

Family  Judge  as Rs. 20,000/-  for the minor

respondents.
2.  The facts, in brief, are that respondents
filed a  suit for maintenance against  the
petitioner in which the interim  maintenance

was initially fixed as Rs. 4OO0l- per child on

L0.02.20t7;  subsequently,  respondent  No.2

fixed the same  as Rs. 2O,00O/- which  has been
assailed vide order dated 29.04.20L9.

Apparently the petitioner  assailed order dated

29.04.20L9 before the Appellate Court  i.e.

respondent  No.3, which  as per learned counsel

for the petitioner  was dismissed  as withdrawn.
3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter

alia, contended  that interim maintenance has

been re-fixed by the learned Trial Couft

without any justification  or basis; that the

2

W.P No. 3541  of 2019

petitioner was not heard before the re-fixation;

that the petitioner is paying Rs. 12000/- per

month as ordered  by the learned  Trial Couft.
4.  Arguments  advanced by the learned

counsel  for the petitioner  have been heard and

the documents placed on record examined with

his able assistance.
5. 

It is trite law that a petition  under Afticle

199 of the Constitution is not maintainable

against an interim order unless the same is

without jurisdiction  or is patently illega!. Under

section L7 of the Family Courts Act, 1964,  the
Family  Court seized of  the matter is
empowered  to fix the interim maintenance,
which is  adjusted at  the time of  final

adjudication. The learned Trial Court has
exercised the referred  jurisdiction by re-

fixation of the maintenance.  Learned  counsel
for the petitioner  failed to point out any

illegality or jurisdlctional error on paft of the

learned Trial Court.
6.  For what has been stated above,  the
instant petition is  without merit and  is

dismissed  in limine.
