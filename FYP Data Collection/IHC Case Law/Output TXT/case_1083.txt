Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
21.10.2021 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Nemo. 

Today,  the  case  was  called  on  its 

turn as well as before the rising of the Court, 

but  on  both  occasions,  no  one  tendered 

appearance  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner.  The 

name  of  the  counsel  for  the  petitioner  is 

reflected  in  the  cause  list.  There  is  no 

application  for  an  adjournment,  therefore, 

the  instant  petition  is  dismissed  for  non-

prosecution.
