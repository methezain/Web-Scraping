Petitioner.  

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submits that 

Petitioner  has  pronounced  divorce  upon  Respondent 

No.  3,  however,  Respondent  No.  1  has  instituted 

inquiry  whereby  it  has  been  found/concluded  that 

Petitioner was  suffering from  paralysis on the date of 

the  purported  divorce  deed.  Therefore,  Respondent 

No.  1  has  recommended  that  matter  may  be  decided 

by  the  learned  Civil  Court  and  as  such  was  referred 

thereto.  Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  submitted 

that the Respondent No. 1 has no such authority. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the Petitioner is required to 

satisfy  this  Court  as  to  how  this  petition 

is 

maintainable  when  a  remedy  is  available  before  the 

learned  Civil  Court  and  also  in  view  of  the  fact  that 

factual disputes are involved.
