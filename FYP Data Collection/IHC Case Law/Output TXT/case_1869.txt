Farzana Kausar/respondent No.2 in person. 
Humaira Aslam, S.I, FIA, Cyber Crime, Islamabad. 

Through  instant  petition,  the  petitioner  has  prayed  for  his 

post  arrest bail in case FIR No.08/18,  dated 28.11.2018, U/S 20, 

21, 24 of PECA 2016 r/w sections 509, 109 PPC, P.S FIA, Cyber 

Crime Circle, Islamabad. 

2. 

Brief facts are that above mentioned FIR was lodged on the 

complaint  of  respondent  No.2/Farzana  Kausar,  wherein  she 

alleged that present petitioner  lshtiaq  Ahmed and his co-accused 

Syed  Sajjad  Hussain  Shah  with  active  collaboration  with  each 

other 

illegally  and  unauthorizedly  up-loaded,  generated, 

posted/shared  personal  sexually  explicit  pictures  of  respondent 

No.2  on  WhatsApp  account  and  she  was  also  harassed  and 

blackmailed.  During  the  course  of  inquiry  phone  numbers 

03318827430  and  03329566378  used  in  the  commission  of the 

offence  were  found  in  the  names  of  co-accused  Muhammad 

Imran  and  present  petitioner  lshtiaq  Ahmed  and  data  was 

retrieved from mobile of the petitioner HTC-Desired 3260. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that  the 

petitioner  is  behind  the  bars  since  28.11.2018,  investigation  of 

the  case  has  been  completed  and  the  petitioner  is  no  more 

2 

Crl. Misc. No.979-B/2018. 

required for the purpose of further investigation; that the offences 

with  which  the  petitioner  has  been  charged  do  not  fall  within 

prohibitory  clause  of  section  497  Cr.P.C;  that  respondent  No.2 

herself  sent  her  pictures  on  mobile  phone  of  the  petitioner  and 

the  pictures  were  neither  uploaded  by  the  petitioner  in  any 

manner nor generated and transmitted in any information system; 

that detailed analysis has not yet been received and the petitioner 

is languishing injail  since 28.11.2018. 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel  has  contended  that  the 

petitioner  and  his  co-accused  induced  respondent  No.2  for 

explicit  photographs  and  later  on  exhibited,  displayed  and 

transmitted  the  images  on  WhatsApp  numbers  and  started 

blackmailing her for nefarious designs. 

5. 

6. 

I have heard the arguments and gone through the record. 

From  tentative  assessment  of  record,  it  transpires  that 

respondent  No.2  lodged  the  complaint  with  police  station  FIA, 

Cyber  Crime  Circle,  Islamabad  with  the  allegations  that  the 

petitioner  Ishtiaq  Ahmed  and  his  co-accused  Syed  Sajjad 

Hussain  Shah  in  collusion  with  each  other 

illegally  and 

unauthorizedly  uploaded  pictures  of  respondent  No.2  on 

WhatsApp  account  and  damaged  her  reputation,  honour  and 

modesty  amongst  the  family  members  and  as  a  result  whereof 

FIR No. 08/18, dated 28.11.2018, U/S 20, 21, 24 of PECA 2016 

r/w  sections  509,  109  PPC,  P.S  FIA,  Cyber  Crime  Circle, 

Islamabad was registered. 

7. 

Cursory glimpse of record reflects that at the time of arrest 

of  the  petitioner,  he  was  in possession  of  mobile  phone,  which 

was  taken  into possession  through  recovery  memo  and the  said 

mobile  phone  was  having  explicit  images  and  photographs  of 

3 

Cr!. Misc. No.979-8/2018. 

respondent No.2,  which prima facie connects the petitioner with 

the  commission  of the  alleged  offence.  The  allegations  leveled 

by  respondent  No.2  against  the  petitioner  fall under  sections 20 

&  21  of The  Prevention  of Electronic  Crimes  Act  2016  as  the 

petitioner uploaded the photographs of natural person in sexually 

explicit  manner,  even  statement  of the  witness/respondent  No.2 

reveals  inducement,  intimidation  and  harassment,  for  which 

information system and network has been used for the purpose of 

communication of photographs and the said act falls within ambit 

of Cyber stalking in terms of section 21  of the Act ibid. 

8. 

The entire record does not reveal any act of further inquiry 

in  favour  of  the  petitioner  and  even  the  petitioner  could  not 

justify  any  reasonable  ground  in  his  favour  to  disassociate him 

from the alleged crime. The mobile phone  used by the petitioner 

contains images although the other information  network used by 

the petitioner  and his co-accused is based upon  laptop and other 

mobile  phones,  which  are under process  of forensic  analysis by 

FIA.  The  element  of fear  is  apparent  through  which  respondent 

No.2  was  forced  to  agree  with  the  demands  of  the  accused 

persons. 

9.  WhatsApp images prima  facie connects the petitioner with 

hideous  crime,  which  in  other  words  is  a  crime  against  the 

humanity and the society. Conduct of the petitioner shows that he 

is  lacking  moral  turpitude,  who  himself  exploited  respondent 

No.2.  Granting bail to the petitioner  at this  stage would amount 

to  trivialize  and  play  down  the  gravity  of  offence  allegedly 

committed by him.

Crl. Misc. No.979-B/2018. 

10.  For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  I  am  not  inclined  to 

accepted the  instant post  arrest bail petition,  therefore, the  same 

is here dismissed.
