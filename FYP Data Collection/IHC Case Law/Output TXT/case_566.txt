This  is  an application  for acceptance  of cash surety 

and  reduction  of  bail  bond  amount  on  the  ground  that 

appellant  belongs  to  an  average  family  and  is  unable  to 

pay  a  huge  amount  of  cash  surety  i.e.  Rs.  1,00,000/-. 

Further contends that he may also be permitted to furnish 

cash surety, as he does not have  any  immovable property 

in Islamabad. 

2. 

This  Court,  vide  order  dated  10.03.2022,  granted 

post arrest bail subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum 

of Rs.100,000/- with  one surety  in the  like amount to the 

satisfaction  of the  learned  trial  court.  The  Petitioner  is 

allowed  to  furnish  surety  in  cash,  but  the  prayer  for 

reduction of the bail amount is declined. 

3. 

CM stands disposed  of.
