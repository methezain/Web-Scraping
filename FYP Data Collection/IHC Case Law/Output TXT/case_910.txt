Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and

necessary. 

Irsalan 

Ibrar,  Advocate 

for 

the 

petitioner.  
Mr. Muhammad Ali Imran, Advocate for the 
respondent No. 3. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of 

Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed 

judgments  and 

decrees  dated  07.01.2021  and  13.01.2020, 

passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

(MCAC), West-Islamabad and learned Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad,  respectively, 

whereby family suit filed by respondent No.3 

was  partially  decreed  and  appeal  was 

dismissed.   

02. 

Succinctly stated, the facts mentioned 

in  the  writ  petition  are  that  petitioner 

solemnized  marriage  with  mother  of 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 771 of 2021 

respondent  No.  3  on  17.05.1996,  according 

to  the  Muslim  Rites  and  Ceremonies.  From 

the  wedlock  one  daughter  namely  Miryam 

Noor  was  born  on  25.03.1997  and  son  / 

respondent  No.  3  was  born  on  13.08.1999. 

Unfortunately,  the  matrimonial  tie  could  not 

succeed  and  resulted 

in  dissolution  of 

marriage,  custody  of  minors  was  given  to 

their  real  mother,  thereafter  mother  of  the 

minors filed suit for maintenance, which was 

decreed 

and 

Rs. 

1200/-  monthly 

maintenance of each minor was fixed, since 

then  petitioner  has  been  paying 

the 

maintenance regularly.  

03. 

In 

the  month  of  August  2017, 

respondent  No.  3  attained  majority  and  the 

petitioner  has 

stopped 

to  pay  him 

maintenance.  Consequently,  respondent  No 

3 on 19.04.2018, filed a suit in his personal 

capacity 

and 

claimed 

educational 

maintenance upto Rs. 25000/-, per month.  

04. 

Suit  was  contested, 

issues  were 

framed and learned Judge Family Court after 

recording  evidence  of  both  the  parties 

partially  decreed  the  suit  in  favour  of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 771 of 2021 

respondent  No.  3  by  awarding  Rs.  10,000/- 

past 

and 

future  maintenance  w.e.f. 

September,  2017  till  January,  2022  with 

10% annual increase. 

05. 

The  petitioner  assailed  the  judgment 

and  decree  dated  13.01.2020,  passed  by 

learned Judge Family Court, West-Islamabad 

before 

learned  Additional  District  Judge 

(MCAC),  West-Islamabad,  the  appeal  was 

also  dismissed  on  07.01.2021,  hence  the 

instant petition.  

06. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter  alia,  contends  that  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  of  both  the  learned 

Courts  below  are  against  law  and  facts  of 

the  case;  respondent  No.  3  (real  son of  the 

petitioner)  is  absolutely  not  entitled  to  seek 

maintenance  allowance  from  the  petitioner; 

learned  Trial  Court  as  well  as  learned 

Appellate Court did not consider the fact that 

petitioner is an aged person and due to bad 

health  condition  cannot  work  or  job;  both 

the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  of 

learned lower Courts are against settled law, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 771 of 2021 

hence not sustainable in the eyes of law and 

same are liable to be set aside. 

07. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent 

No.  3  has  controverted  the  arguments 

advanced  by 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner  and 

stated 

that 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  were  passed  in 

accordance  with  law;  the  petitioner  /  father 

of  respondent  No.  3  is  bound  to  pay  the 

maintenance  /  education  charges;  second 

appeal  is  not  provided  in  the  Muslim  Family 

Laws,  hence  instant  writ  petition  is  liable  to 

be dismissed.  

08.  Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel 

for  the  petitioner  and 

learned 

counsel for the respondent No. 3 have been 

heard  and  record  has  been  perused  with 

their able assistance.  

09. 

It 

is  categorically  mentioned 

in 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

13.01.2020, that respondent No. 3 was held 

entitled to get Rs. 10,000/- per month from 

the petitioner since September, 2017 “till 

January, 2022” with 10% annual increase.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 771 of 2021 

10. 

Today  is  16.12.2021,  and  after  about 

one  month,  entitlement  of  the  respondent 

No.  3,  to  get  /  receive  maintenance  will  be 

expired.  So,  no  prejudice  /  loss  will  be 

caused  to  the  petitioner  for  paying  the 

maintenance  allowance  only  for  the  month 

of January, 2022 to his real son. 

11. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner has 

failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  in  the 

impugned judgments and decrees. It is well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash a decision for an error of law. It will 

also  be  issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess of its jurisdiction, or fails to exercise 

its  jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its 

undoubted  jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of 

natural 

justice.  The  High  Court  while 

issuing  a  writ  of  certiorari  acts  in  exercise 

of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in  exercise  of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 771 of 2021 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal. In this regard, reliance 

is  placed  upon  the  cases  titled  as  Amjad 

Khan  VS  Muhammad  Irshad 

(Deceased) through LRs, (2020 SCMR 

2155), President All Pakistan Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and others 

(2020  SCMR  260),  Chief  Executive 

MEPCO  and  others  VS  Muhammad 

Fazil and others (2019 SCMR 919), 

Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad Usman 

and  others  (PLD  2018  SC  28)  and 

Shajar Islam VS Muhammad Siddique 

and 2 others (PLD 2007 SC 45).  

12. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  dated 

07.01.2021  and  13.01.2020,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  (MCAC), 

West-Islamabad  and  learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  West-Islamabad,  respectively,  are  in 

accordance with law and facts of the matter, 

hence  do  not  require  any  interference  by 

this Court.

In  view  of  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same  is  dismissed  with  no  order  as  to 

costs.
