Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary. 

Nemo 

The ground for the restoration of this petition is that the counsel never 

received  any  information  regarding  the  listing  of  this  case.   The  office  report 

placed on record per the last order however records that the SMS was indeed sent 

and  delivered  to  the  learned  counsel for  the  petitioner  Qazi  Khalil  Ur 

Rehman.   Furthermore,  the  office  report  also  records  that  SMS  for  all  the 

previous dates of hearing including the date on which the case was dismissed for 

non-prosecution  on  14.03.2023  were  also  sent  and  delivered.   Resultantly,  the 

contents  of the CM seeking restoration of this petition are not supported by  the 

office record.   

2   

The CM is therefore dismissed.
