MOHSIN AKHTAR KAYANI, J:- Through  thi's writ petition, the

petitioners  have  prayed  for lump  sum grant and cash payment  in lieu of plot to them

being the surviving  legal heirs and family members  of Iqbal Yousaf  Ex-Computer

Programmer  (BPS-17)  in Pakistan  Council  for Science and  Technology,  who died

on 07.10.2016  during service in terms of Prime  Assistance Package,  2014.

2. 

Leamed counsel  for the petitioner  contends that Iqbal  Yousaf Ex-Computer

Programmer  (BPS-17) was working  with Pakistan  Council for Science and

Technology, who  died on 07.10.2016 during service leaving behind  two un-married

sisters  (petitioners)  and younger un-married brother  Shah Faisal Khan  and the

deceased employee  was also un-married  and as such under the Prime  Minister

Assistance Package, 2Ol4  they are entitled for lump  sum grant  and cash payment  in

lieu of plot.

3. 

Conversely,  learned  AAG contends  that  the petitioners  are not entitled  for

benefits claimed by them  as the required benefits under  the law have  already  been

released,  which  are family pension  and gratuity in terms of rules  and both  the

petitioners are not entitled  for any lump  sum  grant as they do not fall within

eligibility of Prime  Minister Assistance Package,  2014.

4. 

5. 

I have  heard  the arguments and gone through  the record.

Perusal of the record  reveals that Iqbal Youas  Ex-Computer  Programmer

was employee  of Pakistan Council for Science  and Technology, who died on

2

w.P No.789/2019.

07.10.2016 during his service  leaving behind two un-married  sisters i.e. the

petitioners and one younger un-married brother namely  Shah  Faisal Khan  21 years

old. As per record,  the petitioners are entitled for pensionary  benefits and the same

were transmitted  to petitioner No.1 in the following  manner:-

i.  Monthly  Family  Pension and Medical:  Rs.42,6101-
ii. Gratuity: 
iii. Leave Encashment: 
iv. Balance of GPF: 

Rs.188,032l-

Rs.606,360/-

Rs.1,847,865/-

6.  Over and above Pakistan Council for Science  and Technology  dispatched

cheque  No.A362012 dated  03.11.2016  amounting  to Rs.2,454,2251-  and cheque

No.39083915 dated 03.11  .2016 amounting  to Rs.188,0321-  on account  of following

pensionary  benefits:-

i.  Gratuity:
ii. Leave Encashment:

Total:

Rs.1,847,865/-

Rs.606,360/-

Rs.188,032/-

Rs.2,642,2571-

7.  While  considering the above background,  the petitioners  are still aggrieved

and filed the instant  writ petition  with the claim that they  fall under the definition of

family in terms of office  memorandum issued by Government  of Pakistan

Establishment  Division  known as Prime Minister Assistance  Package  for the

families  of Government employees, who died in service and claims lump  sum grant

and cash payment  against the plot. While considering their request, I have gone

through  the letter  dated 09.02.2017,  whereby  Establishment  Division  issued  first

memorandum  to the following  effect:-

of unmarried ofJicials  who die while in service  are entitled for
payment of cash grant  only. In addition,  as per policy  instructions
dated  dh August,  2004, widow/widower,  or a child of a civil servant
who dies during service is entitled for job under  the Assistance
Package.  Appointment of a brother or sister under  the Assistance
Package is not covered under the rules.  Since Late lqbal Yousaf,  ex-
Computer  Operator  (BS-17) has not survived parents, therefore,  his
brother or sister are not entitled for any assistance  under  the Prime
Minister's Assistance Package.

I have gone through each and  every  aspect ofthe  case  and  there is no denial

to the proposition  that  the deceased  has left two sisters  and younger  brother without

leaving  behind  wife or children  and as per further liberalization  of liberalized

pension  rules for civil servants dated  23.10.1983  issued  by Finance Division,

Government  of Pakistan family means:-

,,The 
family for the purpose of payment  of death-cum-retirement
gratuity will include the following  relatives  of the Government
servant:-
(a)  Wife or wives, in the case of a male Government

servant.

(b)  husband,  in the case of afemale  Government  servant'
(c)  Children  or the Government Servant.
(d)  widow  or widows and children  of a deceased  son of the

Government  servant."

g. 

Similarly, while dealing with family  pension  in section 2, the pension  is

given to widow, eldest  surviving unmarried daughter  till she attains  the age of 21

years  or till her marriage,  which ever is earlier,  eldest surviving son below 2l yeats

and by way of amendment  in the said O.M on 24.02.2005,  para 8 sub pua 2(b)

clause  iv has funher been  amended  and substituted  with eldest surviving  urmarried

sisters for life or till her marriage but in all these  categories  this concept is only

available to the family pension and gratuity, which cannot be stretched  in Prime

Minister  Assistance  Package as the Prime Minister  Assistance  Package  was  issued

by the authority  of Prime Minister of Pakistan with different  analogy  and  not under

the further liberulization  of liberalized  pension  rules  for civil servant, therefore,  the

claim  of the petitioners  seeking lump sum grant  in lieu of plot is not made  out,

W.P No.789/2019.

which has not been  given any protection  under the law,  even  the petitioners  have

failed to submit any relevant rules  or enactment through which she can justi$r  their

claim  as matter  of right.  Therefore,  instant  writ petition  is misconceived  and  the
