Mr. Ali Nawaz Kharal and Malik Qamar Abbas, Advocates 
for petitioners. 

Through  this  writ  petition,  the  petitioners  have 

assailed  the  order  dated  12.07.2021,  passed  by  learned 

Executing  Court/Judge  Family/Guardian  Court  (West), 

Islamabad  and  the  order  dated  08.10.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West),  Islamabad, 

whereby, appeal of the petitioners against the production 

of minors before the Court has been dismissed. 

2.   

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  inter-alia 

contends that the petitioner No.1 is mother of petitioners 

No.2  &  3/minors,  who  is  ready  to  comply  with  the  order 

passed  by  learned  Executing  Court  in  letter  and  spirit, 

however,  due  to  past  conduct  of  respondent  No.1/father 

of  minors,  she  apprehends  that  the  minors  will  be 

removed  from  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  the  learned 

Executing Court, therefore, a sufficient surety should have 

been imposed upon respondent No.1 for safe custody and 

visitation  of  the  minors,  who  are  presently  in  custody  of 

their mother. 

3.   

Question raised needs consideration.
