JUDGMENT 

SHAUKAT  AZIZ  SIDDIQUI,  J.---By  invoking  the  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  court, 
petitioner sought declaration, against the judgment and decrees dated 31-7-2009 and 24-12-2009 
passed by learned Judge Family Court, and learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad, being 
without lawful authority, illegal, against law and facts. Petitioner further prayed for setting aside 
the impugned judgment and decrees with a consequence of decree of suit as a whole. 

2.  Brief  facts  as  glean  out  from  the  writ  petition  are  that  marriage  between  the  spouses  was 
solemnized  on  20-1-1995  at  Islamabad,  for  consideration  of  dower  amount  of  Rs.1,00,000. 
Although column No.15 of Nikahnama Exh.P2 suggests that dower was deferred (     )  but columns 
Nos.16  and  17  indicate  that  entire  dower  was  paid  in  shape  of  gold  ornaments  and  a  ho
use.  Petitioner    brought    her    claim    of  gold  ornaments,  weighing  19  tolas,  dowry  articles, 
possession of house  (      ) and maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs.1,500 p.m, fixed under 
column  No.18  of  Nikahnama,  way  of  filing  suit  before  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  at 
Islamabad. In pursuance of the, process issued, the respondent/defendant put his  appearance and 
filed written statement. 

Out of the divergent pleadings of the parties the learned Judge/Family Court framed the following 
issues:--

5. The learned counsel for petitioner submits that both the Courts below failed to appreciate the 
evidence, brought on record, and settled law on the issue before the Court. 

6. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1 submits that petitioner is not entitled to 
discretionary  relief,  through  exercise  of  constitutional  jurisdiction  by  this  Court.  The  learned 
counsel  further  contends that, even on merits,  petitioner has no  case, therefore, writ petition is 
liable to be dismissed. 

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 

7. In my estimation, both the courts below, failed to appreciate the evidence, more particularly 
statement of petitioner who appeared as P.W.1. In an affidavit tendered in evidence as Exh.P1, 
Para 4, petitioner stated as under:-- 

In cross-examination, defendant/respondent side himself put few questions which were replied as 
under:-- 

I believe that this important piece of evidence escaped notice of both the Courts. It is held in the 
case of Muhammad Jaffar v. ADJ reported as 2005 MLD 1069, that solitary statement of wife is 
sufficient to prove the claim of dowry articles. 

8. To, further, satisfy myself and resolve the controversy, parties were directed to appear in person. 
Today they are in attendance. When asked from petitioner whether she is ready, to take oath, in 
support of her claim with regard to dowry articles?, She answered in affirmative. On the contrary, 
when asked from respondent No.1 whether he is ready, to deny the claim of petitioner on oath, 
with regard to dowry articles?, he refused. Petitioner took oath on the "Holy Quran" that she was 
given, dowry articles approximately, amounting to Rs.2,15,000 and that those articles are in the 
possession of respondent No.1. In order to shorten litigation and to do complete justice between 
the  parties  this  exercise  was  taken,  and  I  guided  myself  from  the  authoritative  pronouncement 
ofhonourable  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  in  case  of  Mst.Amina  Begum  and  others 
v. Mehr Ghulam Dastgir, reported as PLD 1978 SC 220. 

9. This stance of husband's side that bride while making claim of dowry articles, is required to 
prove the case, in requirements of Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984, as held by learned trial court, 
not only miscon-ceived, but besides the mandate of law as envisaged in section 17(1) of the West

is reproduced herein below:--- 

"Provisions of Evidence Act and Code of Civil Procedure not to apply.- 

(1) Save as otherwise expressly provided by or under this Act, the provisions of the (Qanun-e-
Shahadat, 
of 
1984))  AND  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908  (except  sections 10 and 11) shall not apply

(2)  Sections  8  to  11  of  the  Oaths  Act,  1873,  shall  apply  to  all  proceedings  before  the  Family 
Courts." 

Bare  reading  of  above  provision  makes  it  abundantly  clear  that  provisions  of  Qanun-e-
Shahadat Order, 1984 are excluded.

receipts,  prepare 

list  of  dowry  articles,  and  obtain  signatures 

10.  Even  otherwise,  in  our  society,  it  is  not  possible  for  any  bride/  wife  to  keep  the  record  of 
purchase 
from 
bridegroom/husband side. In my observation, mothers start collecting, purchase and preserving of 
articles  for  her  daughter,  when  she  starts  growing.  It  is  also  a  tradition  that  in-laws,  of  any 
bride/wife are extended esteem respect and it is considered an insult to prepare the dowry list for 
the purposes of obtaining signature from them. I am also fortified, with the ratio and wisdom of 
the Court of apex provided through cases Muhammad Habib v. Mst.Safia Bibi and others reported 
as 2008 SCMR 1584 and Mirza Arshad Baig v. ADJ reported as 2005 SCMR 1740. 

11. In this view of the matter, instant petition is allowed and impugned judgment and decree passed 
by Additional District Judge, Islamabad dated 24-12-2009 is set aside and judgment and decree 
dated 31-7-2009 is modified by holding that petitioner/plaintiff is entitled to recover an amount of 
Rs.1,50,000 as value of dowry articles, instead of Rs.2,15,000 as an amount of Rs.65,000 is fixed, 
as depreciation  of the dowry articles. Order accordingly.
