Proceedings
L2.12.2O19. Mr. Rais Mumtaz  Hussain, Advocate for

the petitioner.

Through the instant petition, the
petitioner has  assailed order dated
27.03.20t9,  whereby the  suit filed by

respondent No.1 was decreed.

2. 

The facts, in  brief, are that

respondent No.1 filed a suit for recovery  of

maintenance with other relief against  the

petitioner,  which was decreed  against the

petitioner,  vide judgment and decree  dated

27.03.2019.  No appeal was preferred and the

instant  petition  has been filed challenging the

said judgment and decree.

3

Learned counsel for the petitioner,

inter-alia,  contended that the judgment  and

decree  is not maintainable  in the facts and

circumstances.  He was confronted with the
maintainability of  the  instant petition

Writ Petition  No.4338 of 2O79

inasmuch as the remedy of appeal  provided

under the Family  Courts Act, 1964 was not
availed. Learned counsel in  response

submitted that since the remedy is barred by

limitation,  hence the instant petition is being

filed.

4

Arguments advanced  by learned

counsel for the petitioner have been  heard
and the documents placed on  record

examined  with his able assistance.

5

The petitioner is  aggrieved of

judgment and decree dated 27.03.20L9

passed by respondent  No.2. The referred

judgment  and decree was passed  under  the

Family Courts Act, L964, which  provides

remedy  of appeal against  the judgment  and

decree passed by a Family Court; the referred

remedy  was not availed  by the petitioner and
instead after a Iapse of almost nine (09)

months, the instant petition has been filed. It

is trite law that a petition  under Article  199 of

the Constitution  is not maintainable,  where an

alternate and efficacious  remedy is available;

the petitioner despite availability  of  the

remedy did not avail the same.  Moreover, the

instant  petition  has been filed after a lapse of

almost  nine (09) months with no justification

for delay in approaching  the Court;  hence

suffers from laches.
