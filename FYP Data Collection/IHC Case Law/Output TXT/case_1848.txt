MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  the  instant 

writ petition, the petitioner, Rao Abdul Waheed, seeks a direction 

to  the  respondents  (which  include  the  Federation  of  Pakistan, 

through the Secretary, Cabinet Division; the Board of Investment 

(“B.O.I.”);  and  the  Frequency  Allocation  Board  (“F.A.B”))  to 

release  his  salary  and  admissible  allowances  with  effect  from 

30.08.2010  (when  he  joined  his  duties  as  a  deputationist  at  the 

B.O.I.) 

in  accordance  with  his 

last  pay  certificate  dated 

14.02.2011 

issued  by  the  Accountant  General  of  Pakistan 

Revenues.  

2. 

The  facts  essential  for  the  disposal  of  the  instant  petition 

are  that  F.A.B.  was  established  by  the  Federal  Government 

pursuant  to  Section  42  of  the  Pakistan  Telecommunication  (Re-

organization) Act, 1996, in order to take over the functions of the 

Pakistan  Wireless  Board.  F.A.B.  has  the  exclusive  authority  to 

allocate  and  assign  portions  of  the  radio  frequency  spectrum  to 

the  Government,  providers  of  telecommunication  services  and 

telecommunication  systems,  radio  and  television  broadcasting 

operations,  public  and  private  wireless  operators  and  others. 

F.A.B.’s  administrative  control  is  with  the  Cabinet  Division, 

Government of Pakistan.

W.P.No.3084/2011 

3. 

On  01.10.1998,  the  petitioner  was  appointed  as  Assistant 

Director (BS-17) in F.A.B. On 15.03.1999, he was promoted to BS-

18 and  later as Director  (BS-19). The  Inter Services Intelligence, 

vide 

letter  dated  27.10.2009, 

termed 

the  petitioner  as 

“unsuitable”  from  a  security  point  of  view  for  employment  in 

F.A.B.  Vide  Establishment  Division’s  notification  dated 

13.02.2010, the petitioner was transferred and posted as Deputy 

Secretary  in  the  Ministry  of  Sports,  Government  of  Pakistan,  on 

deputation  basis.  The  petitioner  served  as  a  deputationist  in  the 

Ministry of Sports until 29.08.2010.  

4. 

The  Board  of  Investment,  Prime  Minister’s  Secretariat 

(Public) (“B.O.I.”), vide letter dated  16.08.2010, requisitioned the 

petitioner’s 

services 

for  posting  on  deputation.  Vide 

Establishment  Division’s  notification  dated  08.08.2010,  the 

petitioner  was  transferred  and  posted  as  Director  in  the  B.O.I. 

The  petitioner  served 

in  this  position  from  30.08.2010  to 

20.08.2011. 

5. 

Vide Establishment Division’s notification dated 08.01.2011, 

the  petitioner  was  repatriated.  Since  the  said  notification  forms 

the  genesis  of  the  dispute,  it  is  imperative  to  reproduce  its 

operative part herein below:- 

“Rao Abdul Waheed, a BS-19 officer of Frequency Allocation 
Board, Cabinet Division, presently posted as Director (BS-19) 
Board of Investment, Prime Minister’s Secretariat (Public), is 
repatriated and his services are placed at the disposal of the 
Cabinet Division with immediate effect.” 
(Emphasis added)  

6. 

Letter  dated  28.01.2011  from  the  Secretary,  B.O.I.  to  the 

Secretary,  Establishment  Division,  shows  that  in  the  B.O.I.,  the 

petitioner  had  been  entrusted  with 

important  assignments 

relating to administration and financial affairs. Difficulty to relieve 

the petitioner of his duties in the B.O.I. was expressed in the said 

letter  on  the  ground  that  his  substitute  was  not  available.  The 

Secretary,  Establishment  Division,  was  requested  to  allow  the 

petitioner to continue serving in the B.O.I. on deputation basis. It 

appears  that  the  said  request  was  not  acceded  to.  On 

20.08.2011,  the  B.O.I.  also  issued  a  notification  whereby  the 

 
 
 
3 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

petitioner  was  “repatriated  to  the  Cabinet  Division  with 

immediate effect.”  

7. 

After being relieved of his duties by the B.O.I., the petitioner 

reported  for  duty  in  the  Cabinet  Division  on  22.08.2011.  On 

24.08.2011,  the  petitioner  applied  to  the  Secretary,  Cabinet 

Division  for  the  issuance  of  his  formal  posting  orders  in  the 

Cabinet Division so as to enable him to receive his salary.  

8. 

Vide  letter  dated  01.03.2012,  the  Cabinet  Division  asked 

F.A.B.  to  take  the  petitioner  on  its  strength  with  effect  from 

22.08.2011, 

i.e.  when  he  was  repatriated  from  the  B.O.I. 

Furthermore,  the  Cabinet  Division  asked  F.A.B.  to  pay  the 

petitioner’s salary and allowances as admissible under the F.A.B. 

Employees  Service  Regulations,  2007.  Apparently,  on 

06.03.2012,  the  petitioner  went  to  F.A.B.  to  join  his  duties,  but 

was  not  permitted  to  enter  F.A.B.’s  premises.  The  petitioner 

brought  the  said  fact  to  the  notice  of  the  Secretary,  Cabinet 

Division, vide letter dated 06.03.2012.  

9. 

The  Cabinet  Division,  vide  letter  dated  15.03.2012,  called 

upon F.A.B. to comply with the earlier letter dated 01.03.2012 and 

to  take  the  petitioner  on  its  strength.  The  petitioner’s  second 

attempt  to  report  for  duty  at  F.A.B.  on  16.03.2012  was  met  with 

the same resistance by F.A.B. as before. Apparently, the Cabinet 

Division  had  continued  to  make  efforts  for  the  petitioner  to  be 

taken  back  on  F.A.B.’s  strength.  This  state  of  affairs  continued 

until 21.08.2015 when the petitioner was compulsorily retired. 

10.  F.A.B.’s  letter  dated  06.03.2014  to  the  Cabinet  Division 

makes  an  interesting  read.  Vide  the  said  letter,  F.A.B.  informed 

the Cabinet Division as to its inability to take the petitioner on its 

strength.  The  position  taken  by  F.A.B.  in  the  said  letter  was  that 

the Inter Services Intelligence had not given security clearance to 

the  petitioner  for  the  continuation  of  his  employment  in  a 

sensitive  organization  like  F.A.B.  The  petitioner  was  also  said  to 

have  been  found  guilty  in  a  case  of  professional  misconduct. 

F.A.B.  had  also  taken  the  position  that  it  could  not  pay  the 

petitioner  for  the  period  during  which  he  had  not  performed 

duties  in  F.A.B.,  and  that  paying  the  petitioner  for  such  a  period 

 
 
4 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

would  amount  to  taking  him  back  on  F.A.B.’s  strength.  The  said 

letter  also  shows  that  the  Cabinet  Division  had  made  efforts  to 

adjust 

the  petitioner 

in  autonomous  bodies  under 

its 

administrative  control,  but  no  autonomous  body  had  accepted 

the  petitioner.  As  an  alternative,  it  was  suggested  that  the 

petitioner’s  case  be  referred  to  the  competent  authority  for  his 

compulsory  retirement.  F.A.B.,  vide  letters  dated  06.03.2012, 

13.09.2012,  29.11.2012,  31.01.2013  and  06.11.2013  had 

requested  the  Cabinet  Division  to 

initiate  a  case  for  the 

petitioner’s  compulsory  retirement  from  service,  but  to  no  avail. 

Vide  the  said 

letter  dated  06.03.2014,  F.A.B.  once  again 

requested  the  Cabinet  Division  to  compulsorily  retire  the 

petitioner from service under Section 13(1)(i) of the Civil Servants 

Act,  1973,  or  to  remove  him  from  service,  in  which  case  F.A.B. 

would  pay  the  petitioner’s  emoluments/retirement  benefits  in 

accordance with the rules/regulations.  

11.  As  mentioned  above,  vide  notification  dated  21.08.2015 

issued  by  F.A.B.,  major  penalty  of  compulsory  retirement  was 

imposed  on  the  petitioner  in  exercise  of  the  powers  under 

Regulation 181(4) of the F.A.B. Employees (Service) Regulations, 

2014.  The  petitioner  has  challenged  the  said  notification  dated 

21.08.2015  in  writ  petition  No.3868/2016,  which  is  pending 

adjudication  before  another  Bench  of  this  Court.  The  petitioner 

has not been paid any salary or allowance for the period between 

22.08.2011  when  the  petitioner  reported  for  duty  to  the  Cabinet 

Division  and  21.08.2015,  when  he  was  compulsorily  retired  by 

F.A.B. 

12.  The  Finance  Division,  in  its  office  memorandum  dated 

03.01.2019,  has  taken  the  position  that  since  the  petitioner  was 

an  employee  of  F.A.B.,  which  is  an  autonomous  body,  and  since 

he  was  compulsorily  retired  after  the  issuance  of  a  show  cause 

notice,  “FAB may determine the status of intervening period of 

the office in consultation with the Establishment Division.”   

13.  During 

the  pendency  of 

the 

instant  petition, 

the 

Establishment  Division 

issued  office  memorandum  dated 

08.02.2019 in which it was clarified that the petitioner’s salary for 

 
 
5 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

the  period  between  22.08.2011  and  21.08.2015  shall  be  paid  by 

his parent department, i.e. F.A.B. 

14.  The  petitioner  seeks  a  direction  to  the  B.O.I.,  Cabinet 

Division  and  F.A.B.  to  pay  his  salary  and  admissible  allowances 

from  30.08.2010  to  21.08.2015,  when  he  was  compulsorily 

retired.  

15.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, after narrating the facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition,  submitted  that  the 

petitioner  was  a  permanent  employee  of  F.A.B.;  that  the 

petitioner’s  consent  was  not  obtained  when  he  was  sent  on 

deputation to the Ministry of Sports, vide Establishment Division’s 

notification  dated  13.02.2010;  that  the  petitioner  had  to  invoke 

the  jurisdiction  of  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  order  to  get  his 

salary for the period during which he served as a deputationist at 

the Ministry of Sports; that for the period between 30.08.2010 and 

20.08.2011  while  the  petitioner  served  as  a  deputationist  at  the 

B.O.I.,  he  was  paid  less  than  his  salary  package  in  his  parent 

department;  that  instead  of  being  repatriated  to  his  parent 

department,  (i.e.  F.A.B.),  the  Establishment  Division  repatriated 

the  petitioner  to  the  Cabinet  Division,  vide  notification  dated 

08.01.2011; that after 22.08.2011 the petitioner was not paid any 

salary until his compulsory retirement on 21.08.2015; that despite 

the  Cabinet  Division’s  letters  dated  01.03.2012  and  15.03.2012, 

F.A.B. had not permitted the petitioner to resume his duties;  that 

the  petitioner’s  repeated  efforts  to  join  his  duties  were  resisted 

by  F.A.B.;  that  vide  notification  dated  21.08.2015  issued  by 

F.A.B., major penalty of compulsory retirement had been imposed 

on  the  petitioner;  that  the  petitioner  has  challenged  the 

imposition of the said penalty in writ petition No.3868/2016 before 

this  Court;  and  that  the  Establishment  Division,  vide  office 

memorandum dated 08.02.2019, has clarified that the petitioner’s 

salary  between  22.08.2011  and  21.08.2015  is  to  be  paid  by  his 

parent department, i.e. F.A.B. Learned counsel for the petitioner 

prayed  for  the  writ  petition  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the  relief 

sought therein. 

 
 
6 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

16.  On  the  other  hand, 

learned  counsel  for  respondent 

No.6/F.A.B.  submitted  that  ever  since  the  petitioner  was  posted 

out of F.A.B. on 13.02.2010, he had not worked for a single day in 

F.A.B.;  that  F.A.B.  was  under  no  obligation  to  pay  the  petitioner 

since  he  had  not  performed  his  duties  in  F.A.B.;  that  since  the 

petitioner  was  unable  to  obtain  security  clearance  from  Inter 

Services  Intelligence,  he  could  not  be  allowed  to  work  in  F.A.B.; 

and  that  the  petitioner  has  been  compulsorily  retired  from 

service. Learned counsel for F.A.B. prayed for the writ petition to 

be dismissed.  

17.  The learned Amicus Curiae concurred with the submissions 

made  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner.  He  further 

submitted  that  the  Federal  Government  ought  not  to  interfere  in 

the  functioning  of  autonomous  bodies;  that  since  the  petitioner 

had  not  been  paid  his  salary,  his  fundamental  rights  had  been 

violated; that delay on the part of F.A.B. in proceeding against the 

petitioner  departmentally  did  not  absolve  it  from  paying  the 

petitioner;  and  that  writ  petition  ought  to  be  allowed.  In  making 

his  submissions,  learned  Amicus  Curiae placed  reliance  on  the 

judgments  in  the  cases  of  Chairman  NADRA,  Islamabad  VS 

Muhammad  Ali  Shah  (2017  SCMR  1979),  and  Irfan  Ahmed  VS 

Federation of Pakistan (2016 PLC (C.S.) 491.  

18. 

I have heard the contentions of the learned counsel for the 

contesting parties as well as those of the learned Amicus Curiae 

and have perused the record with their able assistance. The facts 

leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have  been  set  out  in 

sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  2  to  14  above,  and  need  not  be 

recapitulated.  

19.  The F.A.B. Employees Service Regulations, 2007 (“the 2007 

Regulations”)  were  made  by  F.A.B.  in  exercise  of  the  powers 

conferred 

under 

Section 

42(3) 

of 

the 

Pakistan 

Telecommunication 

(Re-organization)  Act,  1996.  The  2007 

Regulations  were  made  with  the  approval  of  the  Federal 

Government  and  published  in  the  official  Gazette  on  09.10.2007. 

Since 

the  petitioner  was 

initially  sent  on  deputation  on 

13.02.2010, and the notification for his repatriation was issued on 

 
 
7 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

08.01.2011, the dispute with respect to the quantum of his salary 

etc.  would  be  determined 

in  accordance  with 

the  2007 

Regulations,  and  not  F.A.B.  Employees  Service  Regulations, 

2014.  In  this  regard,  paragraph  5.21  of  the  2007  Regulations  is 

reproduced herein below:- 

“Terms and Conditions of Deputation of Board employees to 
Foreign  Service  in  Pakistan.  –The  terms  and  conditions  of 
transfer of Board employees to Foreign Service in Pakistan shall 
be the same standard terms and conditions as applicable to the 
Civil Servant as per instructions of the Federal Government 
issued from time to time.” 

20.  The  terms  and  conditions  on  which  civil  servants  can  be 

sent  on  deputation  are  set  out  in  Establishment  Division’s  O.M. 

No.1/13/87-R.I,  dated  03.12.1990,  which  was 

issued  after 

consultation  with  the  Finance  Division.  According  to  this  O.M.,  a 

deputationist is entitled to draw “pay in BPS as admissible under 

the Government from time to time”. This provision in the said O.M. 

affords  protection  to  the  deputationist’s  pay.  In  addition  to  this, 

Fundamental Rule No.114 provides as follows:- 

“F. R. 114.  A Government servant in foreign service will draw 
pay from the foreign employer from the date on which he 
relinquishes charge of his post in Government service. Subject 
to any restrictions which the Governor-General may by general 
order impose, the amount of his pay, the amount of joining time 
admissible to him and his pay during such joining time will be 
fixed by the authority sanctioning the transfer in consultation 
with the foreign employer.” 

21.  F.R. 114 makes it imperative for a deputationist’s pay to be 

fixed by the lending and the borrowing departments. In the event 

the  terms  and  conditions  of  an  employee’s  deputation  are  not 

settled  between  the  borrowing  and  the  lending  department,  the 

deputationist’s  salary  etc.  payable  to  him  by  his  parent 

department  cannot  be  varied  to  his  detriment.  Under  no 

circumstances,  can  a  deputationist  be  made  to  suffer  for  the 

omission of his parent and lending department to settle the terms 

of his deputation. 

22.  When  the  petitioner  was  sent  on  deputation  to  the  Ministry 

of  Sports,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  his  deputation  were 

admittedly  not  settled  between  the  borrowing  and  the  lending 

department.  It  is  not  disputed  that  the  pay  scales  of  F.A.B.’s 

 
 
 
 
8 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

employees  are  different/more  attractive  than  those  of  the 

employees working in the Federal Secretariat. After the petitioner 

was sent on deputation to the Ministry of Sports, he was not paid 

any salary. The position taken by the Finance Division, in its O.M. 

dated  31.08.2010,  was  that  there  was  no  deputation  policy  for 

employees  of  autonomous  organizations,  and  that  since  the 

petitioner was an employee of F.A.B. posted as Deputy Secretary 

in the Ministry of Sports on deputation basis, he was only entitled 

to the pay and perks attached to the post of Deputy Secretary in 

the  Federal  Government.  The  Finance  Division  also  proposed 

certain  terms  and  conditions  for  the  petitioner’s  service  as  a 

deputationist in the Ministry of Sports. 

23.  Since  the  petitioner  was  not  paid  any  salary  during  his 

service  as  a  deputationist  in  the  Ministry  of  Sports,  he  filed  a 

petition  (HRC  No.27368-G/2010)  before  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court.  On  26.11.2010,  the  Director,  Human  Rights  Cell  of  the 

Hon'ble  Supreme  Court,  forwarded  his  application  to  the 

Secretary  Establishment  with  the  direction  “to ensure that the 

matter is resolved” and  a report submitted  within 15 days”.  Vide 

Finance  Division’s  office  memorandum  dated  31.12.2010,  the 

Establishment  Division  was  informed  that  a  decision  had  been 

taken  that  the  petitioner  “may be allowed pay and allowances 

admissible to him in his parent office  i.e. FAB during the period 

he remained already posted as Deputy Secretary in the Federal 

Secretariat  to  resolve  the  issue  as  per  direction  of  the 

Honourable  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan.”  Consequently,  the 

petitioner  was  paid  his  salary  for  the  period  he  had  served  as  a 

deputationist in the Federal Secretariat/ Ministry of Sports.  

24.  After  the  petitioner  was  sent  to  B.O.I.  on  deputation,  the 

Finance  Division,  in  its  O.M.  dated  26.03.2012,  took  the  position 

that  for  the  period  during  which  the  petitioner  served  as  a 

deputationist 

in 

the  B.O.I. 

(i.e.,  between  30.08.2010  and 

21.08.2011),  the  petitioner  was  entitled  to  the  protection  of  his 

substantive pay (i.e. Rs.66,478/-) plus allowances admissible to a 

BS-19  officer 

in  the  Federal  Secretariat.  Accordingly,  on 

06.04.2012,  for  the  period  between  30.08.2010  and  20.08.2011, 

 
 
9 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

an  amount  of  Rs.10,21,725/-  was  paid  by  the  B.O.I.  to  the 

petitioner.  This  amount  also  came  to  be  less  than  what  the 

petitioner would have been paid in his parent department.  

25. 

It is an admitted position that the salary and allowance paid 

to  the  petitioner  during  his  service  as  deputationist  from 

30.08.2010  to  20.08.2011  in  the  B.O.I.  was  lower  than  his  salary 

package  of  a  BS-19  officer  in  F.A.B.  During  his  service  as  a 

deputationist  in  the  B.O.I.,  the  petitioner  was  entitled  to  be  paid 

not  less  than  the  salary  package  admissible  to  him  in  his  parent 

department.  Consequently,  the  B.O.I. 

is  bound  to  pay  the 

petitioner  the  differential  in  the  amount  for  his  service  in  the 

B.O.I. and the amount which would have been payable to him by 

his parent department in addition to deputation allowance.  

26.  Vide  Establishment  Division’s  notification  08.01.2011,  the 

petitioner  was “repatriated”  and  his  services  were  placed  at  the 

disposal of the Cabinet Division. It was not until 20.08.2011 when 

the  B.O.I.  issued  a  notification,  whereby  the  petitioner  was 

“repatriated  to  the  Cabinet  Division”.  On  22.08.2011 

the 

petitioner  reported  for  duty  at  the  Cabinet  Division.  Ever  since 

then  the  petitioner  has  not  been  paid  a  single  penny  until  the 

imposition of the penalty of compulsory retirement upon him. 

27.  The  petitioner’s  repatriation  notification  issued  by  the 

Establishment  Division  is  unique.  Instead  of  repatriating  the 

petitioner to his parent department, i.e. F.A.B., the Establishment 

Division’s  notification  dated  08.01.2011  placed  the  petitioner’s 

services at the disposal of the Cabinet Division. This having been 

done,  the  Cabinet  Division  had  no  valid  reason  not  to  pay  the 

petitioner  his  salary  and  allowances  as  would  be  payable  to  him 

by  his  parent  department,  in  addition  to  deputation  allowance. 

This is regardless of the fact whether or not the Cabinet Division 

had  issued  the  petitioner’s  formal  posting  orders.  Since  the 

Cabinet  Division,  vide  letters  dated  01.03.2012  and  15.03.2012, 

had called upon F.A.B. to take the petitioner back on its strength, 

the  Cabinet  Division’s  obligation  to  pay  the  petitioner  would 

commence  from  22.08.2011  (when  the  petitioner  reported  for 

duty  at  the  Cabinet  Division)  until  01.03.2012  (when  the  Cabinet 

 
 
10 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

Division  first  called  upon  F.A.B.  to  take  the  petitioner  on  its 

strength).  As  mentioned  above,  F.A.B.  did  not  even  let  the 

petitioner enter its premises, let alone pay his salary. 

28. 

If the petitioner’s parent department was not willing to take 

him back on duty due to the absence of his security clearance by 

the  Inter  Services  Intelligence,  appropriate  measures  ought  to 

have been taken by F.A.B. to deal with the situation. For instance, 

an inquiry could have been timely instituted against the petitioner 

and  pending  such  inquiry,  he  could  have  been  placed  under 

suspension.  This,  F.A.B.  did  not  do.  F.A.B.  not  just    ignored  the 

requests made by the Cabinet Division to take the petitioner back 

on duty, but also refused to pay his salary. F.A.B. had no plausible 

justification to do this. Learned counsel for F.A.B. did not bring on 

record any service rule or regulation prior to the framing of F.A.B. 

Employees Service Regulations, 2014, governing the petitioner’s 

service,  to  show  that  if  an  employee  of  F.A.B.  was  not  given  a 

security  clearance  by  the  Inter  Services  Intelligence,  he  would 

not  be  paid  his  salary  or  that  he  would  perforce  to  be  sent  on 

deputation elsewhere. 

29.  Having  gone  through  the  voluminous  record  of  this  case,  I 

have formed the view that the petitioner has been made to suffer 

due  to  sheer  disregard  of  the  law  on  the  part  of  not  just  F.A.B., 

but  also  the  Cabinet  and  the  B.O.I.  The  Ministry  of  Sports  and 

F.A.B.  did  not  even  bother  to  settle  the  terms  and  conditions  of 

the petitioner’s service as a deputationist. There is nothing on the 

record to show that the petitioner’s consent was obtained before 

he was sent to the Ministry  of Sports  on deputation.  If there was 

no  policy  for  an  employee  of  an  autonomous  body  to  be  sent  on 

deputation to the Federal Secretariat, the Establishment Division 

should  not  have  sent  the  petitioner  on  deputation  from  F.A.B.  to 

the Ministry of Sports and later to the B.O.I. The very least that a 

deputationist is entitled to is the protection of his salary package 

payable  to  him  by  his  parent  department.  It  is  only  through  the 

intervention of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the petitioner was 

paid  his  salary  etc.,  for  his  service  as  a  deputationist  in  the 

Ministry  of  Sports.  The  petitioner’s  pay  certificate  dated 

 
 
11 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

14.02.2011  was  issued  by  the  Accountant  General  of  Pakistan, 

after  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court’s  direction  in  HRC  No.27368-

G/2010.  This  pay  certificate  sets  out  the  sum  total  of  the 

petitioner’s  pay  and  allowances  etc.  The  petitioner  has  a  legal 

right  to  be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  said  pay  certificate  and 

permissible increases,  if any,  for  the  period  between 22.08.2011 

until  the  imposition  of  the  penalty  of  compulsory  retirement  on 

him. 

30. 

It  is  well  settled  that  the  right  to  life  guaranteed  under 

Article 9 of the Constitution includes the right to livelihood. Salary 

from  employment  is  considered  a  lifeline.  The  petitioner’s  salary 

for the period between 22.08.2011 and 21.08.2015 (date on which 

he was compulsorily retired) was never tendered/paid to him. By 

not  paying  the  petitioner’s  salary  and  allowances,  F.A.B.  as  well 

as the Cabinet Division have clearly deprived the petitioner of his 

right  to  livelihood.  The  petitioner’s  financial  straits  caused  by 

such  deprivation  was  not  dealt  with  by  his  employers.  In  such 

circumstances, this Court holds that the petitioner’s fundamental 

right  to  life,  as  explained  above,  was  violated  by  F.A.B.  and  the 

Cabinet Division. In holding so, I derive guidance from the law laid 

down in the following cases:-  

(i) 

In  the  case  of  Mazhar  Abbas  Shah  VS  Managing  Director, 

Punjab  Seed  Corporation  (2015  PLC  (C.S.)  1440),  it  was 

held  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  that  there  was  no 

justification  in  withholding  the  salary  of  a  civil  servant 

during  the  pendency  of  departmental  proceedings  against 

him.  Furthermore,  it  was  held  that  a  civil  servant  was 

entitled  to  all  the  salaries,  service  benefits,  bonus,  and 

medical expenses till the date he is terminated from service. 

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Ghulam  Umar  Kazi  VS  General  Manager 

(2006  PLC  (C.S.)  1143),  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble 

High Court of Sindh held as follows:- 

“[I]t is evident that non-payment of living salary to low 
paid employees prima facie amounts to deprivation of 
right to life guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution. It 
is  extremely  disturbing  to  note  that  delay  in 
disbursement of funds or settlement of liability between 
different arms of the government have brought them to 

 
 
 
12 

W.P.No.3084/2011 

this  state  of  affairs.  Evidently,  the  services  of  the 
petitioners have not been terminated in accordance with 
law and, as such, they are required to be paid their 
salaries. The fact that funds could not be obtained is 
only a matter of inefficiency of different departments and 
obviously  the  petitioners  could  not  be  made  to 
suffer on this account.” 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Metropolitan  Corporation,  Lahore  VS  Imtiaz 

Hussain  Kazmi  (PLD  1996  Lahore  499),  it  was  held  as 

follows:- 

“6.  If an employee/servant is not paid his salary/wages 
for the work done by him for his employer, he is not 
expected to live a proper life. If he does not get his salary 
then how can he sustain himself and his family members. 
Even if he does not starve and manages to keep his soul 
and body intact, his own life and those of his dependent 
members of the family are bound to heavily suffer in 
quality. The life as contemplated by Article 9 does not 
merely  mean  a  vegetative  life  but  it  also  includes  a 
qualitative life which should ensure enjoyment of such 
other amenities and facilities as are enjoyed by a person 
born in a civilized society. The term 'life' used in Article 9 
of the Constitution has been used in a wider sense, which 
means that a man should not be able only to sustain life but 
to enjoy it as well. 
7.  Similarly  Article  14  of  the  Constitution  which 
guarantees  dignity  of  man  is  contravened  when  an 
employee/servant  is  denied  his  right  to  receive  his 
salary/wages by him. Article 14, inter alia, commands “the 
dignity of man and, subject to law, the privacy of home, 
shall be inviolable”. A man who is denied the fruit of the 
labour and work done by him is bound to live in a manner 
which will deprive him of his dignity.” 

(iv) 

In  the  case  of  Qazi  Khan  VS  The  State  of  Pakistan  (PLD 

1965  (W.P.)  Peshawar  41),  it  was  held  that  there  is  a 

Constitutional  guarantee  under  which  the  tenure  and 

conditions  of  service  of  any  person  serving  under  the 

Government shall not be varied to his disadvantage.  

(v) 

In  the  case  of  Muhammad  Anwar  VS  Government  of 

Pakistan (PLD 1962 Lahore 443),  it was held by none other 

than  the  great  jurist  Justice  M.R.  Kayani,  that  “mandamus 

can now issue to Government to pay to a government 

servant his salary at a certain rate, and it is only logical to 

say  further  that  mandamus  can  issue  to  require 

Government to pay his salary to a government servant or to 

pay arrears of salary ….. it would not be logical to say that

while the fixation of salary is a public duty, its payment is 

not a public duty”.  

31.

with the following directions:-  

(i)

joined  his  duties  as  a  deputationist  at  the  B.O.I.)  and 

20.08.2011  (when  the  petitioner  was  repatriated  by  the 

B.O.I.)  the  differential  in  the  amount  actually  paid  to  the 

petitioner  by  the  B.O.I.  and  the  amount  under  the 

petitioner’s pay certificate dated 14.02.2011 along with the 

permissible increases  during  the  said  period,  shall  be  paid 

by the B.O.I.  

(ii) 

For  the  period  between  22.08.2011  (when  the  petitioner 

reported  for  duty  at  the  Cabinet  Division  after  the  B.O.I.

the  Cabinet  Division,  vide  letter  dated  01.03.2012,  called 

upon  F.A.B.  to  take  the  petitioner  on  its  strength)  the 

petitioner’s salary etc. shall be paid by the Cabinet Division 

in the amount as payable to a BS-19 officer of F.A.B. 

(iii)  For  the  period  between  01.03.2012  (when  the  Cabinet 

Division first called upon F.A.B. to take the petitioner on its 

strength)  and  21.08.2015 

(when  major  penalty  of 

compulsory  retirement was  imposed  on  the  petitioner),  the 

petitioner’s salary etc. shall be paid by F.A.B. in the amount 

as payable to a BS-19 officer of F.A.B.
