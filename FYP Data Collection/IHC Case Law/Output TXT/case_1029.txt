11.11.2021  Mr.  Muhammad  Zahir,  Advocate  on 
behalf  of  Zaib  Un  Nisa 
in  above 
captioned two writ petitions. 

Mr.  Muhammad  Tanveer  Khalid  Awan, 
Advocate  on  behalf  of  Malik  Khalid 
Mehmood  in  above  captioned  two  writ 
petitions.  

Through 

the 

instant  order, 

I 

intend  to  decide  the  above  captioned 

two writ petitions, as they entail common 

questions of law and facts. 

02. 

Petitioners 

in  both 

the  writ 

petitions  have  assailed  judgments  and 

decrees 

dated 

01.07.2021 

and 

27.04.2021, passed by learned Additional 

District  Judge,  West-Islamabad  and  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad, respectively. 

03. 

Succinctly stated facts of the case 

are that the petitioner in writ petition No. 

2782 of 2021, namely Mst. Zaib Un Nisa 

(hereinafter called daughter)  is  the  real 

daughter of Malik Khalid Mehmood Awan 

(hereinafter  called  the  father), 

respondent  No.  3  of  writ  petition  No. 

2782  of  2021  and  petitioner  of  writ 

petition No. 2911 of 2021. 

04. 

The  daughter  is  residing  with  her 

mother,  as  the  father  has  divorced  his 

wife  /  mother  of  petitioner  namely  Mst. 

Abida  Begum  in  the  year  1995/96  and 

contracted  second  marriage  with  Mst. 

Shabana  Bibi.  The  mother  of  daughter 

and father were separated when she was 

only  5  years  old  and  since  then  she  has 

been requesting for maintenance but the 

father never paid any maintenance. Now 

the  daughter  want 

to 

start  her 

matrimonial life  but  unable  to  afford the 

expenditure  of  marriage.  Father  is  an 

employee 

of  Capital  Development 

 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

Authority  (CDA)  and  owner  of  many 

properties  in  Islamabad.  The  daughter 

requested  to  her  father  for  marriage 

expenditure  and  maintenance  but  he 

refused to do so, hence she filed suit for 

past  maintenance 

and  marriage 

expenditure. 

05. 

Suit  was  contested  by  her  father, 

issues  were 

framed,  evidence  was 

recorded  and 

learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  West-Islamabad  vide  impugned 

judgment  dated  27.04.2021,  partially 

decreed the suit filed by the daughter in 

a  manner  that  she  was  held  entitled  to 

get Rs. 12,00,000/- as past maintenance, 

Rs.  10,00,000/-  as marriage expenditure 

including gold and Rs. 5000/- per month 

from  institution  of  the  suit  till  her 

marriage  with  10%  annual  increase, 

from  her  father  and  rest  of  her  claims 

were  declined  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court-West, Islamabad.  

06.  Being  aggrieved  of  the  impugned 

judgments 

and 

decrees 

dated 

01.07.2021  and  27.04.2021,  both  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

parties  i.e.  daughter  and  father  have 

filed above mentioned writ petitions, the 

daughter  has  averred  that  the  learned 

trial  Court  vide  impugned  judgment  has 

not granted the past maintenance of Rs. 

20,00,000/-  and  Rs.  15,00,000/-  as 

marriage  expenses  along  with  expenses 

of litigation @ Rs. 50,000/- as prayed in 

the  family  suit.  The  daughter  is  also 

aggrieved  by  the  judgment  and  decree 

dated  01.07.2021,  whereby  the  learned 

Additional  District 

Judge 

(West), 

Islamabad  has  modified  in  the  manner 

that  plaintiff  is  not  entitled  for  expenses 

of marriage. 

07. 

The  father  is  aggrieved  by  both 

the  judgments  and  decrees  of  the  lower 

Courts.  

08. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

/  daughter  in  writ  petition  No.  2782  of 

2021  inter  alia  contends 

that 

the 

judgment  and  decree  dated  01.07.2021, 

passed  by  learned  Additional  District 

Judge  (West),  Islamabad,  whereby  the 

judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

learned Judge Family Court was modified 

to  the  extent  that  the  petitioner  / 

daughter  was  held  not  entitled  for  the 

grant  of  marriage  expenses  by  mis-

reading 

and 

non-reading 

of 

the 

evidence;  the  petitioner  /  daughter  has 

clearly  proved  her  case  through  the 

cogent evidence; she was entitled for the 

marriage  expenses; 

local  commission 

was also appointed by the learned Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad  who  has 

submitted  a  report  which  is  erroneous 

and not tenable under the law. 

09. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

/ father in writ petition No. 2911 of 2021 

inter  alia  contends 

that  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments 

and  decrees 

passed  by  lower  Courts  are  erroneous; 

the 

daughter 

cannot 

claim 

past 

maintenance  according  to  law,  as  no 

provision of Family Law provides that the 

father  will  be  liable  to  pay  the  marriage 

expenses, hence both the judgments and 

decrees  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court, West-Islamabad as well as 

 
 
 
6 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  West-

Islamabad  are  liable  to  be  set  aside, 

whereby  the  decision  to  the  extent  of 

payment of maintenance to the daughter 

was  upheld;  both  the  judgments  and 

decrees are erroneous not tenable under 

the law and the same have been passed 

against the dictum laid down by superior 

Courts  of  the  country;  both  the  Courts 

below  have  passed  the  judgments  and 

decrees  without  applying  their  judicial 

mind;  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees are suffered from legal infirmity, 

hence  the  same  were  liable  to  be  set 

aside. 

10.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

11. 

It 

is  admitted 

fact 

that 

the 

petitioner / Mst. Zaib Un Nisa is the real 

daughter  of  Malik  Khalid  Mehmood 

Awan,  who  was deserted  along  with her 

mother  when  she  was  aged  about  5 

years.  Father  of  the  petitioner  has  not 

paid the past maintenance. As far as the 

arguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  /  Khalid  Mehmood  Awan 

 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

(father)  is  concerned  that  daughter  has 

filed the suit at this belated stage  which 

is hit by the Limitation Act, 1908 and not 

sustainable  under  the  law,  rather  the 

father  is  legally,  morally  and  ethically 

bound 

to  maintain  her  daughter 

according to law.  

12.  As  far  as  the  marriage  expenses 

are  concerned,  there  is  no  provision  in 

the  family  law  that  the  father  will  be 

bound  to  pay  the  marriage  expenses  to 

his daughter.  

13.  According  to  injunctions  of  Islam, 

Nikkah  can  be  solemnized  in  simple 

manner  and  only  fee  of  the  Nikkah 

Khvaan is liable to be paid which is very 

meager expense.  

14. 

Father  has  already  burdened  with 

heavy 

amount 

in 

lieu 

of 

past 

maintenance i.e. Rs. 12,00,000/- and Rs. 

5,000/-  per  month  till  marriage  of  his 

daughter with 10% annual increase. 

15. 

Learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

West-Islamabad 

vide 

impugned 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

judgment  and  decree  dated  01.07.2021, 

has rightly declared that the marriage of 

the  daughter  has  not  been  solemnized, 

so  the  daughter  has  not  spent  any 

amount  on  her  wedding  as  well  as  on 

purchase of jewelry articles and she was 

held not entitled for marriage expenses. 

16.  There  are  concurrent  findings  on 

the issue for grant of maintenance to the 

daughter  by  both  the  learned  Courts 

below.  In  case  of  concurrent  findings  of 

the 

courts  below, 

scope  of 

the 

constitutional  petition  becomes  very 

limited. The petitioner has failed to point 

out  any  misreading  or  non-reading  of 

evidence. It has been laid down in a case 

titled as “Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS Abdul 

Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others” 

(2008 YLR 2309), that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope of the constitutional petition 

for interference is very limited and 

it can only be interfered when the 

orders  of  the  Courts  below  are 

fanciful or based on misreading or 

non-reading of the evidence". The 

 
 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

same  view  has  also  been  taken  in  a 

case  titled  as “Sadruddin VS Aslam 

Madad Ali and others” (PLD 2008 

Karachi 2005). 

17. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is 

only  available  to  quash  a  decision  for 

an error of law. It will also be issued for 

correcting errors of jurisdiction when an 

inferior Court or a tribunal acts without 

jurisdiction  or 

in  excess  of 

its 

jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise  its 

jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its 

undoubted  jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of 

natural  justice.  The  High  Court  while 

issuing  a  writ  of  certiorari  acts  in 

exercise  of 

supervisory  and  not 

appellate jurisdiction. The High Court in 

exercise  of  its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not 

review  the  findings  of  facts  reached  by 

the inferior Court or a tribunal. Reliance 

may  be  made  to  the  following  case 

laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan VS Muhammad Irshad 

 
 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

(Deceased)  through  LRs” 

(2020 SCMR 2155), it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

"It is by now a settled 

principle of law that the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the  discretion  exercised 

by  lower  courts  unless 

the  same  suffers  from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words, such interference 

would  be  justified  in 

cases  where 

the 

impugned order has been 

passed 

without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading  or  non-

reading of evidence, or is 

not  in  accordance  with 

the law. If none of these 

errors  is  present,  the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings of lower courts 

merely  because 

it 

reached  a  different 

conclusion  as  to  the 

 
 
11 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

controversy  than  the 

latter.  In  this  regard, 

reference can be made to 

a  collective  reading  of 

Mst.  Mobin  Fatima  v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad  (1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"President  All  Pakistan 

Women 

Association, 

Peshawar 

Cantt 

VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and 

others” (2020 SCMR 260),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It  is  settled  law  that 

when  the  Statute  does 

not provide the right of 

appeal  against  certain 

orders, the same cannot 

be 

challenged  by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High 

Court in order to gain a 

similar objective. Where 

a Statute has expressly 

barred a remedy which is 

not available to a party 

under  the  Statute,  it 

 
12 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

cannot  be 

sought 

indirectly  by  resort  to 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High 

Court.  The  High  Courts 

exercising constitutional 

jurisdiction must be fully 

cognizant and conscious 

of this Rule and strictly 

adhere  to  the  same  in 

the interest of advancing 

the  policy  of  law  and 

delivering  expeditious 

justice  in  accordance 

with  the  law  and  the 

Constitution. 

Even 

otherwise, constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and  discretionary  in 

nature and should not be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass the purpose of a 

validly enacted statutory 

provision."  

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"Where the Court or the 

Tribunal has jurisdiction 

and 

it  determines 

 
 
 
 
13 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

specific question of fact 

or  even  of  law,  unless 

patent  legal  defect  or 

material  irregularity  is 

pointed  out, 

such 

determination  cannot 

ordinarily  be  interfered 

with by the High Court 

while 

exercising 

jurisdiction under Article 

199 of the Constitution." 

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"The powers of judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 

of the Constitution is no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the  Judge's  hands 

however, the same shall 

not  be  exercised  in  a 

case where discretion is 

exercised  by 

the 

subordinate  court  / 

Tribunal  in  a  fair  and 

just  manner  without 

violating or disregarding 

statutory  provision  of 

law,  likely  to  occasion 

 
 
14 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

the  failure  of  justice. 

Ordinarily 

such 

extraordinary 

jurisdiction shall not be 

exercised at random and 

in routine manner”. The 

following  case  law  is 

reproduced  for  the 

guidance of the learned 

Judges of the High Court 

for  future  course  of 

action:  

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmed 

v. Government of Pakistan, 

through  Secretary,  Interior 

Division,  Islamabad  (1994 

SCMR 2142). 

(ii) Shahnaz  Begum  v.The 

Hon’ble Judges of the High 

Court  of  Sindh  and 

Balochistan(PLD  1971  SC 

677). 

(iii) Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar 

v.  GhulamQasim  Khan 

Khakwani  (PLD  1994  SC 

281). 

(v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam  VS  Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 

2007 SC 45),  it  is  held  by  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The  High  Court  in 

exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional 

 
15 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

jurisdiction 

is  not 

supposed to interfere in 

the  findings  on  the 

controversial  question 

of  facts  based  on 

evidence  even  if  such 

finding  is  erroneous. 

The scope of the judicial 

review of the High Court 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution  in  such 

cases, is limited to the 

extent of misreading or 

non-reading of evidence 

or if the finding is based 

on  no  evidence  which 

may  cause  miscarriage 

of justice but it is not 

proper  for  the  High 

Court  to  disturb  the 

finding of fact through 

reappraisal of evidence 

in  writ  jurisdiction  or 

exercise this jurisdiction 

as  a  substitute  of 

revision or appeal”. 

18. 

For  what  has  been  discussed 

above,  both  the  learned  counsel  have 

failed  to  point  out  as  to  how  the 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  dated 

01.07.2021  and  27.04.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West-

Islamabad  and  learned  Judge  Family 

 
 
 
16 

Writ Petitions Nos. 2782/2021 & 2911/2021 

Court,  West-Islamabad,  respectively  are 

the consequence of error law or without 

jurisdiction  and  excess  of  jurisdiction, 

hence both the impugned judgments and 

decrees  do  not  require  interference  by 

this Court. Both the writ petitions are not 

maintainable,  hence  dismissed  being 

meritless with no order as to costs.
