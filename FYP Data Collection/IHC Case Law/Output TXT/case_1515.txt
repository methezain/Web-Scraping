LUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ, J. 

Petitioner 

has 

invoked 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  by  way  of  filing  instant  writ 

petitioner  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of 

Pakistan, 1973, with the following prayer:- 

“It  is  most  respectfully  prayed  that  the  instant  Writ  Petition  may 
very  graciously  be  accepted  by  setting-aside  the  impugned  order 
dated  12-02-2020  passed  by  respondent  No.3  in  execution 
proceedings  and  it  is  further  prayed  that  an  order  may  kindly  be 
passed  by  directing  the  respondent  No.2  to  deposit  an  amount  of 
Rs.  92,00,000/-  as  per  statement  recorded  vide  dated  28.01.2020 
before respondent No.3 by way to adopt all modes of executing as 
per provision of law.  

Any other relief which this Honorable Court deems fit and 

proper may also be awarded to the petitioner”.  

2. 

Necessary facts for disposal of instant petition are that  the petitioners 

filed a suit for maintenance against Respondent No.1, which was decreed by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Chakwal,  vide  judgment  &  decree  dated 

25.06.2011  and  maintenance  was  awarded  to  petitioners  No.  2  to  5    @  

Rs.  4,000/-  per  month  per  child  w.e.f  28.01.2007  with  annual  increase  of 

15%.  Said  judgment  and  decree  dated  25.06.2011,  was  assailed  before  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Chakwal,  but  the  same  was  upheld  vide 

judgment and decree dated 05.01.2012. The judgment passed by the learned 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P a g e  | 2 
W.P.No. 2425/2020 

Additional District  Judge was further challenged before the Hon’ble Lahore 

High Court through W.P. No. 969/2012 and the Hon’ble High Court upheld 

the judgment but with slight modification in annual increase  by reducing it 

from 15% to 10% per annum,  vide judgment dated 18.10.2016. Thereafter, 

petitioners  filed  execution  petition  which  was  transferred  from  District 

Chakwal  to  Islamabad,  where  the  Respondent  No.1  opted  not  to  appear 

before  the  learned  Executing  Court  and,  therefore,  after  issuance  of 

notices/summons, the court issued bailable and then non bailable warrant of 

his arrest on 20.12.2016 & 07.02.2017, respectively.  He was finally arrested 

and  sent  to  the  Civil  Prison  vide  order  dated  09.12.2017,  which  order  was 

assailed by Respondent No.1/Judgment Debtor before the learned Executing 

Court, Appellate Court and finally before this High Court through W.P.No. 

2342/2018  for  his  release  from  civil  prison.  His  request  was  declined, 

however, this Court vide judgment dated 19.07.2018, directed the Executing 

Curt  to  summon  the  petitioner  from  Civil  prison  in  person  and  ask  him  to 

deposit  sufficient  surety  for  his  conditional  release.  In  compliance, 

Respondent  No.1 was called by the learned executing Court from the civil 

prison,  but  he  still  failed  to  do  the  needful.  On  13.03.2019,  petitioners’ 

counsel  recorded  her  statement  that  decree  holder  did  not  know  about 

properties  of  Respondent  No.1,  to  be  attached  for  satisfaction  of  judgment 

and  decree  dated  25.06.2011,  hence,  the  file  of  execution  proceedings  was 

consigned  to  the  record  room.  Later,  on  25.01.2020  petitioner  moved  an 

application for  appropriate order to  execute the  judgment and decree dated 

25.06.2011 and on the same day Respondent No.2 appeared and recorded his 

statement  before  the  Court  whereby  he  admitted  that  he  has  to  return  an 

amount  to  Rs.  92,00,000/-  on  account  of  business  transactions,  to  the 

judgment  debtor/Respondent  No.1  and  is  ready  to  deposit  the  same  in  the 

Court  on his  behalf. The learned  Executing  Court  in view of  his  statement 

vide  order  dated  12.02.2020  ordered  for  attachment  of  moveable  assets  of 

Respondent  No.2  amounting  to  Rs.  92,00,000/-,  whereas,  according  to 

P a g e  | 3 
W.P.No. 2425/2020 

petitioner, she does not know about the assets of the Respondent No.2, and 

has filed instant petition for setting aside order dated 12.02.2020. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  inter-alia,  submitted  that  the 

impugned  order  has  been  passed  without  application  of  judicial  mind,  as 

such, is not sustainable in the eye of law; that the impugned order has been 

passed without hearing the petitioner which is against the settled principle of 

audi  alterm  partem.  Learned  counsel  lastly  contended  that  the  learned 

Executing Court instead of passing order for attachment of moveable assets 

of creditor of the Judgment Debtor it should have directed Respondent No.2 

to  deposit  the  amount  of  Rs.  92,00,000/-  in  the  Court  till  disposal  of 

petitioners’  application  and  requested  to  modify  the  impugned  order, 

accordingly. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.1  while 

supporting the impugned order submitted that same is just and lawful which 

has been passed after proper application of judicial mind keeping in view the 

facts and circumstances of the case as well as relevant law. She prayed for 

dismissal of instant writ petition.  

5. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

6. 

Perusal of the order sheet attached with execution petition shows that 

during proceedings on the petitioners’ application for appropriate orders for 

execution  of  decree,  the  creditor/Respondent  No.2  of  the  judgment 

debtor/Respondent No.1 appeared in person and voluntarily got recorded his 

statement on 25.01.2020, admitting therein that he had to pay an amount of 

Rs. 92,00,000/- to Respondent No.1 and gave consent to deposit the same in 

the  court.  Thereafter,  on  12.02.2020,  in  the  light  of  the  statement  of  the 

creditor  of  the  judgment  debtor  earlier  recorded,  order  for  attachment  of 

moveable  property  amounting  to  Rs.  92,00,000/-  till  further  orders,  was 

passed. Now, the petitioners seek modification in the said order to the extent 

P a g e  | 4 
W.P.No. 2425/2020 

that  instead  of  attachment  of  moveable  assets  of  the  creditor,  he  may  be 

ordered for deposit of amount of Rs. 92,00,000/- in the court.  

7. 

It is apparent from the order sheets of the learned Executing Court that 

the  Creditor  of  the  judgment  debtor  has  voluntarily  recorded  his  statement 

before the Court regarding deposit of an amount of Rs. 92,00,000.0 which he 

has  to  pay  to  the  judgment  debtor,  therefore,  the  petitioners’  prayer 

regarding issuance of directions to him in this regard seems justified.  

8. 

In view of background and litigation history of the case, which clearly 

reveals  that  due  to  apathetic  attitude  of  Respondent  No.1  towards  his  real 

children (Petitioner Nos. 2 to 5), the judgment and decree dated 25.06.2011 

has  been  executed  till  date,  hence,  the  titled  petition  is  allowed  and  order 

dated 12.02.2020, passed by the learned Judge Family Court is modified to 

the  extent  that  the  creditor  /  Respondent  No.2  is  directed  to  deposit  the 

amount  of  Rs.  92,00,000/-  before  the  learned  Executing  Court,  at  the 

earliest, for the satisfaction of the decree.
