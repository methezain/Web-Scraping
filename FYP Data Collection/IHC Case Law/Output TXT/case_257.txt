Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

25.11.2022. 

Rana Imran Farooq Advocate for the Petitioner. 
Nemo, for the Respondents. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  seeks 

further time to satisfy this Court that the Petitioner 

has paid arrears of maintenance allowance and that 

he  is  up-to-date  in  such  payments.  It  is  important 

to summarize that vide Order dated 29.09.2021 the 

Impugned Judge and Decree was suspended to the 

extent  of  payment  of  dower  amount  i.e.  one 

million  and  no  suspension  order  was  passed  for 

maintenance  allowance. 

In  any  event, 

the 

suspension  order  in  respect  of  the  dower  amount 

was  recalled  on  23.05.2022  as  it  was  admitted  on 

such  date  that  arrears  of  maintenance  allowance 

have not been paid. 

2. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  writ  jurisdiction 

cannot be exercised in favour of the Petitioner till 

he  establishes  his  bonafide  conduct  as  he  who 

seeks equity must do equity.  

3.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  has 

stated  that  the  Executing  Court  has  allowed  the 

Petitioner 

to  make  payment  of  arrears 

in 

installments  which  the  Petitioner  is  abiding  by. 

The  learned  counsel is directed to substantiate his 

submission by producing such order passed by the 

 
 
 
 
 
learned  Executing  Court  and 

the 

relevant 

documents to show that all arrears of maintenance 

have been cleared.  It is made clear that this is the 

last  and  final  opportunity  for  the  Petitioner  to 

satisfy this Court that arrears of maintenance have 

been  cleared  and  that  he  is  up-to-date  in  this 

regard.  

4.  Relist on 06.12.2022.
