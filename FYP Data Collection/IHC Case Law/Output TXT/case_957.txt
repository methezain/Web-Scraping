03.12.2021.  M/s  Mian  Tahir  Iqbal  and  Shakir  Javaid, 

Advocates for the petitioner.   

The  petitioner  has  impugned  judgment 

and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court dated 19.04.2021 and judgment 

and  decree  dated  16.09.2021  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  pursuant  to 

which  appeal  filed  against  the  judgment  and 

decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court was dismissed.  

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

contended  that  the  maintenance  granted  for 

each  minor  child  of  the  petitioner  in  the 

amount  of  Rs.50,000/-  and  maintenance 

granted 

to  petitioner’s 

former  spouse/ 

respondent  No.1 

in 

the 

amount 

of 

Rs.50,000/-  per  month  for  Iddat  period  was 

excessive  and  beyond  the  means  of  the 

petitioner.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

submitted  that  the  judgment  and  decree 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2  

                    W.P No. 3962 of 2021 

Judge suffered from infirmity as the income of 

the petitioner was determined on the basis of 

a  visiting  card  of  the  petitioner  produced  by 

respondent  No.1  which  indicated  that  he  was 

working as General Manager Allied Services at 

Shifa  International  Hospital.  He  submitted 

that the learned Family Court and the learned 

Additional  District  Judge  ought  to  have 

decided  the  quantum  of  maintenance  on  the 

basis  of  an  affidavit  sworn  by  the  petitioner 

and  filed  before  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court  dated  22.09.2020  which  was  exhibited 

as Exh.D1, which reflected that the petitioner 

had resigned from Ali Medical Centre and was 

not  drawing  salary  and  other  benefits  as 

claimed by respondent No.1.  

3.  When  asked  by  the  Court  as  to  the 

present  occupation  and  source  of  income  of 

the  petitioner,  the  petitioner  filed  a  break-up 

of his salary as of November 1, 2021 through 

C.M  No.  4918/2021,  Which  reflected  that  his 

gross  salary  per  month  was  Rs.470,000/-. 

The  petitioner  has  also  placed  on  record  an 

appointment  letter  dated  21.09.2020  titled 

“Change  of 

responsibilities  &  Contract 

Extension”  which  states  that  the  title  of  the 

petitioner  has  been  changed  from  Hospital 

Director,  Shifa  City  Hospital  (Sialkot)  to 

 
 
3  

                    W.P No. 3962 of 2021 

“General  Manager-Allied  Services”  and  that 

his  contract  period  stood  extended  to  June, 

2021  with  a  salary  of  Rs.400,000/-.  The 

petitioner further submitted that he joined Ali 

Medical  Centre  on  07.08.2017  and  resigned 

on  15.10.2019.  He  subsequently  joined  Shifa 

Sialkot  Project  on  01.11.2019,  which  was  a 

project  of  Shifa  International  Hospital  and 

was formally employed by Shifa International 

Islamabad 

through 

aforementioned 

employment 

letter 

(titled 

“Change  of 

responsibilities and contract extension”) dated 

21.09.2020. 

In  view  of 

the  continued 

employment of the petitioner with Ali Medical 

Centre  and  subsequently  with  a  project  of 

Shifa  International,  the  learned  counsel  has 

failed to make out a case that the amount of 

maintenance  ordered  by  the  learned  Family 

Court  and  upheld  by  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge  is  beyond  the  means  of  the 

petitioner.  The 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner  has  also  failed  to  point  out  any 

legal infirmity in the impugned judgments and 

decrees  that  calls  for  intervention  by  this 

Court 

in 

its  extraordinary  constitutional 

jurisdiction.   

4.  While  exercising  its  discretionary  and 

equitable  jurisdiction  a  key  consideration  for 

 
 
4  

                    W.P No. 3962 of 2021 

this  Court  is  that  the  petitioner  comes  to  the 

court with clean hands. In view of the conduct 

of the petitioner, it appears that the petitioner 

has  not  been  truthful.  The  affidavit  sworn  by 

the petitioner before the learned Family Court 

dated  22.09.2020  in  relevant  part  at  para.5 

states the following:  

“Now  I  am  no  more  serving  at  Ali  Medical 

as  Plaintiff  No.1  along  with  her  brother 

namely Bilal Taj created problems in job of 

Defendant  as  well  and  he  had  to  resign 

(Relevant  record  available  with  the  Hon’ble 

Court)  and  Defendant  nor  drawing  the 

claimed  salary  or  other  benefits.  At 

present,  Defendant 

is 

earning 

just 

Rs.25,000/-  per  month  which  comes  as  a 

rental  amount  of  one  bed  room  flat  owned 

by Defendant in Bahria Town. Defendant is 

residing  with  his  father  in  his  house  as  he 

cannot afford to live independently, running 

his  day  to  day  expenses  by  taking  money 

from 

father,  wife  and  piece  meal 

compensation received from Advisories.”    

5. 

Thus,  what  the  petitioner  swore  before 

the learned  Family  Court was that  he  did not 

have  a  job  and  his  only  source  of  regular 

income  was  Rs.25,000/-  which  came  in  the 

form  of  rental  income  of  one  bed  room  flat 

owned by the petitioner. And that in order to 

meet  his  day  to  day  expenses  he  was 

dependent  on  his  father  who  supported  him 

financially.  The  petitioner  presented  a 

 
 
5  

                    W.P No. 3962 of 2021 

different  story  before  the  learned  appellate 

Court, which recorded the following regarding 

the income of the petitioner:  

“The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant 

contended 

that 

the  appellant 

is  non 

practicing  MBBS  Doctor  and  at  the  present 

he  is  engaged  as  consultant  in  a  private 

organization  and  drawing 

salary  of 

Rs.70,000/-“  

6. 

Thus  the  representation  made  to  the 

learned Family Court was that the petitioner’s 

means were Rs.25,000/- in rental income, the 

representation 

to 

the 

learned  Additional 

District Judge at the time of hearing of appeal 

was  that  the  petitioner  was  earning  an 

amount  of  Rs.70,000/-  per  month.  In  the 

statement filed before this Court through C.M 

No.  4918/2021,  the  petitioner  submitted  that 

his  gross  salary  is  Rs.470,000/-  per  month 

and  in  the  list  of  expenses  he  has  listed 

Rs.50,000/-  attributable  to  the  care  of  his 

father  even 

though  his  affidavit  dated 

22.09.2020  stated  that  he  was  financially 

dependent  of  his  father  from  whom  he  took 

money to meet his day to day expense.                                               

7. 

In  view  of  the  record  produced  before 

this  Court  by  the  petitioner,  he  was  never 

unemployed  and  was  earning  a  salary  of 

Rs.400,000/-  as  reflected  in  the  letter  issued 

 
 
 
6  

                    W.P No. 3962 of 2021 

by  Shifa 

International  Hospital  dated 

21.09.2020,  at  the  time  when  he  swore  the 

affidavit  dated  22.09.2020  produced  before 

the  learned  Family  Court  as  part  of  his  own 

testimony  to  establish  that  his  only  income 

was 

rental 

income 

in 

the  amount  of 

Rs.25,000/-. 

From 

the 

aforementioned 

account  it  seems  that  not  only  did  the 

petitioner  come  to  this  Court  with  unclean 

hands,  he  may  prima  facie  have  rendered 

himself  liable  for  perjury  and  for  giving  and 

fabricating false evidence in terms of sections 

191 and 192 of PPC punishable under section 

193 of PPC.  

8. 

In  view  of  the  above,  this  petition  is 

dismissed  for  being  without  merit.  Let  a 

copy  of  this  order  be  sent  to  the  learned 

District  and  Sessions  Judge,  West  Islamabad 

for  initiating  appropriate  proceedings  against 

the  petitioner  to  determine  if  he  is  liable  for 

giving and fabricating false evidence.
