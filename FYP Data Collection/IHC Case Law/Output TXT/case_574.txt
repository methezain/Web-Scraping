Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

                              14.03.2022.  Mr.  Sajid  Mehmood  Choudhary,  Advocate  for 

the Petitioner.  
Mr. Dawood iqbal, State Counsel.  
Mr.  Muhammad    Ali,  Advocate  for  Respondent 
No. 3.  

Learned  counsel  for  Petitioner  submits 

that 

through 

the 

Impugned  order  dated 

04.10.2021 

the  Deputy  Commissioner/ 

Commissioner 

(Rev), 

ICT, 

Islamabad  has 

erroneously failed to exercise jurisdiction which 

is  exclusively  vested 

therein  pursuant 

to 

Section  6(4)  of 

the  Muslim  Family  Law 

Ordinance, 1961 and has erroneously held that 

the learned Family Court has jurisdiction based 

on  wrongful  interpretation  of  Judgment  dated 

13.09.2021 passed by  Honourable Lahore High 

Court in Criminal Revision No. 168/2019.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2. 

Learned  State  Counsel  has  candidly 

conceded that such assertion of the Petitioner is 

correct  and 

in  respect  of  application 

for 

contracting  2nd  marriage  revision  would  indeed 

lie to Deputy Commissioner, ICT, Islamabad. In 

so  far  as  the  Judgment  relied  upon  by  the 

Deputy Commissioner is concerned, the same is 

regarding  offences  under  Section  6(5)(b)  of  the 

Muslim Family law Ordinance, 1961 whereas in 

the instant case no offence has been committed.  

3. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  matter  is 

remanded 

to  Deputy  Commissioner  with 

direction to hear the revision application of the 

Petitioner  and  to  decide  it  in  accordance  with 

law within a period of two months from the date 

of receipt of certified copy of this order.  

4. 

Petition stands disposed of.
