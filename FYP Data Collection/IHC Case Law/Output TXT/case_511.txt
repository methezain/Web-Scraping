C. M. No.435/2022 

The main writ petition was dismissed  for 

non-prosecution on 07.02.2022. Consequently 

the instant application was filed for restoration 

of  the  petition.  On  the  last  date  of  hearing, 

the  learned  counsel  for  the  applicant  did  not 

appear  before  this  Court  as  he  was  stated  to 

be  busy  before  another  Bench  of  this  Court. 

He  has  not  appeared  before  this  Court  once 

again  today.  The  applicant  has  also  not 

appeared  before  this  Court.  Therefore,  the 

instant  C.M.  also  stands  dismissed  for  

non-prosecution.
