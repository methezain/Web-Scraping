In 
Writ Petition No.1876 of 2021 

Zahid Mehmood. 
VS
The Additional District Judge (East), Islamabad and 05 others. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
03. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
13.07.2021  Nemo. 

Case  was  called  in  the  earlier 

Court 

hours 

but 

neither 

the 

applicant/petitioner  nor  his  counsel  has  put 

an  appearance.  The  case  was  kept  pending 

and  was  again  called  in  the  late  hours  but 

situation  is  same.  The  name  of  the  counsel 

for the applicant/petitioner is reflected in the 

cause  list.  There  is  no  application  for  an 

adjournment,  therefore,  instant  application 

for  restoration  of  the  petition  is  dismissed 

for non-prosecution.
