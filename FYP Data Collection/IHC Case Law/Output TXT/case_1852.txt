increase, 

The petitioner agitated the matter before the learned Additional District 

Judge  through  an  appeal,  which  was  dismissed  vide  impugned 

judgment and decree dated 22.10.2018. Hence, the instant writ petition. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  contends  that  petitioner  and 

respondent  No.1 got married  on 25.12.2007 under  Hanfi Law, who  are 

blessed with  Shaeel Haider Syed (son) and  Anaya Syed (daughter) on 

06.12.2009 and 24.06.2013, respectively; that respondent No.1 has left the 

house of petitioner without his knowledge on 04.10.2013 to stay with her 

brother  at  Sector  G-11, Islamabad,  but  instead  of  returning  home, 

respondent  No.1 filed complaint in 1-8 Police Station for recovery of her 

son  Shaeel  Haider  from  petitioner;  that  respondent  No.1  also  filed 

habeas corpus  petition before this Court, whereby  the said  minor was 

handed  over  to  respondent  No.1  vide  order  dated  21.10.2013; that 

respondent  No.1 was  Professor at  HBC University  of  Baluchistan on 

deputation  basis and  petitioner was  Professor at  International  Islamic 

University Islamabad at the time of filing of the cases; that  respondent 

No.1  filed  suit  for  dissolution  of  marriage  along  with  other  claims, 

which was decided by the learned Trial Court without  considering the 

evidence available on record as the findings on Issues No.2 and 4  were 

not given in a proper  manner despite the fact that  petitioner has taken 

the stance that  he is jobless and  maintenance has been fixed on higher 

W.P.  No.4668/2018 

Page  I  3 

side; that respondent No.1 has failed to substantiate on record regarding 

the financial sources of petitioner and fixation of maintenance on higher 

side is factually beyond the financial status of petitioner, which is harsh, 

excessive, exorbitant  and  inflated;  that  both  the  Courts  below  have 

ignored the principle of disobedience at  the part  of wife as she herself 

left the  house,  therefore, she  is not  entitled  for  any  maintenance; that 

respondent No.1 was bound to prove the claim of gold ornaments in her 

list  at  Serial  Nos.22  to  29,  but  she  did  not  produce  any  evidence 

regarding purchase of gold ornaments from her pocket; that the learned 

Trial Court  has not considered that  personal belongings of the spouses 

were  stolen,  against  which  case  FIR No.112, dated  10.04.2012, under 

Section 381/343 PPC, P.S.  Ramna, Islamabad was  registered, but  even 

then by discarding all these facts the1learned Trial Court has imposed an 

amount  of  Rs.520,000/- upon  the  petitioner;  that  due  to  financial 

conditions of petitioner, he is looking after his ailing father, therefore, he 

is unable to pay  maintenance more than  Rs.15,000/- for minors, hence, 

the claim of respondent  No.1 may be modified to that  extent, which is 

otherwise on higher side at the rate of .Rs.40,000/- per month. 

4. 

Conversely, learned  counsel for  respondent  No.1 contends  that 

the  overwhelming evidence submitted  by respondent  No.1 has rightly 

been appreciated by both the Courts below and  it is the duty  of father 

i.e.  petitioner  to  provide  maintenance  including  school  fee,  daily 

expense, clothing, medical, shelter and  security  to  the  minors  and  he 

cannot wriggle out from his responsibilities; that concurrent findings of 

W.P.  No.4668/2018 

Page  I  4 

the  Courts  below  could  not  be  interfered  with 

in  constitutional 

jurisdiction  and  any other view could not be taken on factual side. 

5. 

I  have  heard  the  arguments  advanced  by learned  counsel for the 

parties  and  perused  the record. 

6. 

The perusal  of record  reveals that  petitioner  and respondent  No.1 

entered  into marriage  under  the Hanfi Law and  have  been blessed  with 

two children  namely  Shaeel and  Anaya. On 04.10.2013, respondent  No.l 

left the  house  of petitioner,  lodged  a complaint  against  him  and  sought 

custody  of  minor  son  before  this  Court,  which  was  given  to  her  vide 

order  dated  21.10.2013, whereafter  she  filed  separate  two  suits  for 

dissolution  of marriage,  recovery of articles, personal  belongings  as well 

as  recovery  of  past,  present  and  future  maintenance  allowance. 

Accordingly,  consolidated  issues  were  framed  and  respondent  No.l 

submitted  her  affidavit  of evidence  (Exh.Pl) with  her  complete  claim of 

delivery  charges  and  maintenance  allowance.  During  the  course  of 

cross-examination  of  Respondent  No.l, 

she  acknowledged 

that 

petitioner  is  a  Canadian  citizen,  who  was  employed  in  International 

Islamic University  Islamabad  and  in  the  early  days,  he  has  two  cars  in 

his  house  and  marriage  was  dissolved  on  03.06.2014 by  way  of Khula, 

whereas  she lastly denied  the suggestion  that petitioner  was jobless. 

7. 

Similarly,  petitioner  appeared  as  DW-1  and  submitted  his 

affidavit  as  Exh.Dl,  in  which  he  has  given  a  detailed  account  of  his 

entire  life and  contends  that  respondent  No.l  did  not  allow him  to visit 

the  minors  and  after  order  of visitation  by the learned  Guardian  Court, 

he  has  withdrawn  his  custody  petition.  He  also  acknowledged  that  he 

W.P. No.4668/2018 

Page  I  5 

deposited  maintenance  of Rs.20,000/- in the account of respondent  No.1, 

whereas  he also tried  to sort all things out with respondent  No.1, but she 

remained  adamant.  He  also  acknowledged 

that  all  gold  jewelries 

claimed by respondent  No.1 were already  kept by mother  of respondent 

No.1  and  not  a  single  article  of respondent  No.1  was  retained  by  him. 

Petitioner  has taken  a specific stance that  he was removed  from  HEC on 

31.01.2014  and  he  is  regularly  paying  the  maintenance  allowance  @ 

Rs.16,000/- per month  despite  the fact that  he was jobless, whereas  he is 

now  unable  to pay  maintenance  due  to ailment  of his father.  During  the 

course  of  cross-examination,  petitioner  has  acknowledged 

that 

in 

November,  2015, he  attended  meeting  on  behalf  of College  of Applied 

Sciences, Ashakria  University,  Sultanate  of Oman  in Athens,  Greece; he 

also  acknowledged 

that  he  is  external  supervisor  and  working  on 

honorary  basis  and  he  attended  the  University  of  Oman  on  different 

occasions. He also acknowledged  that  he remained  in Bahria University, 

in  which  he  was  getting  salary  of Rs.130,000/-. He  also  acknowledged 

that  from 03.06.2014 till 20.04.2015, he has not paid  any maintenance  and 

he  has  started  paying  interim  maintenance  w.e.f.  20.04.2015. He  also 

acknowledged  that  in  his  affidavit  (Exh. Dl)  he  has  not  referred  the 

amount  of Rs.520,000/- which was stolen from the house. 

8. 

The  petitioner  in  his  favour  produced  his  cousins  namely  Syed 

Arif Hussain  Zaidi and  Munawra  Begum as witnesses,  who  appeared  as 

DW-2 and  DW-3, while  DW-2 acknowledged  during  the course of cross  

examination  that  the  parties  were  living  jointly  in  house  situated  in 

Sector G-7, Islamabad  and  their  household  articles  were  stolen  against 

W.P. No.4668/2018 

Page  I  6 

which  FIR  was  registered,  however  the  police  recovered  the  gold 

jewelries  and  cash  to  the  tune  of  Rs.400,000/-  or  Rs.450,000/-, which 

were then handed  over to petitioner. 

9. 

I have  gone through  the findings  given by the learned  Trial Court 

and  in full agreement  with the same as no discrepancy  has been noted  in 

the above referred  evidence, even otherwise,  the petitioner  has taken the 

stance that  he is jobless, but  at the same time he is taking  care of his old 

father and  is presently  paying the maintenance  at old rate. In my humble 

view, it is the duty  and responsibility  of the father to provide  all kinds of 

facilities  to  his  children  and  he  cannot  wriggle  out  from  his 

responsibilities  being a father. From the perusal  of record,  it reflects that 

respondent  No.1  is  properly  managing  the  affairs  of  minors  and  the 

claim submitted  by respondent  No.l  being  mother  is not  denied  by the 

petitioner,  rather  he  has  only  taken  the  plea  that  he  is jobless, which  is 

unjustified  plea for the reason  that it is not the responsibility  of a mother 

to manage  the affairs of minors  on financial side. Petitioner  being father 

has  to  earn  for  his  own  livelihood  as  well  as  for  the  minors  and  he 

cannot take a shield behind  his plea of being a jobless. 

10. 

Besides  the  above  referred  position,  the  petitioner  failed  to 

demonstrate  through  any  documentary  evidence  that  from  the  filing of 

the  suit  he  ever  applied  for  any  job  and  he  was  rejected  by  the 

department,  company,  university  or  any  other  educational  institutions. 

When no such evidence  was brought  on record  by petitioner,  his simple 

plea as of being jobless could not be accepted. 

W.P.  No.4668/2018 

Page  I  7 

11. 

Even  otherwise,  the  maintenance  granted  by  both  the  Courts 

below  is  on  minimum  side  as  respondent  No.1  submitted  detailed 

account through  documentary evidence started from Exh.P2 to Exh.P9, 

therefore, the maintenance claim of respondent  No.1 is upheld  and  no 

illegality has been pointed out by petitioner except of his plea that the 

maintenance  is  on  higher  side.  The  other  claim  has  also  been 

acknowledged by DW-2 in his cross-examination and  the learned Trial 

Court has rightly granted the decree in favour of respondent No.1 as the 

petitioner has failed to point out any illegality and he remained unable 

to demonstrate any valid justification to avoid the maintenance as well 

as  the  claims of  respondent  No.l,  therefore, the  instant  writ  petition 

merits  dismissal  without  having  any  interference by  this  Court  as 

maintenance  could  not  be  reduced  in  constitutional  jurisdiction, 

which has otherwise been rightly appreciated by both the Courts below 

on factual side. 

12. 

In  view  of  above  discussion,  the  instant  writ  petition  is 

hereby DISMISSED.
