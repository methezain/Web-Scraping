Ch. Muhammad  Javed  Gujjar, Advocate for respondent No.2.
Naveed,  S.I, P.S Lohi Bher,Islamabad  alongwith  record.

Through  instant criminal  miscellaneous  petition,  the

petitioner  has prayed  for post arrest bail in case FIR No.309/19,

dated  24.09.2019,  U/S 3241452, 337-A(i),  337-A(ii), 337-F(i)

PPC,  P.S Lohi Bher,Islamabad.

2.  Brief  facts are that Ashraf Baig/complainant/respondent

No.2  got registered the above  mentioned  FIR with  the allegations

that on 24.09.2019, at about 12:30 a.m, when  he alongwith his

family  members  was sleeping in House No.14,  Street  No.5,

Block-B, Sawan  Garden,  Islamabad,  Mfuza Abdul  Rehman

(present petitioner)  his ex-son  in law after breaking the door

entered in the house and when he tried to go to the room  of his

daughter  and granddaughter  he stopped him, upon  which  he said

that he will not spare  anyone.  On hearing hue  and  cry his elder

son in law Major Mohsin came  out from the room and  asked the

petitioner to leave  the house, in the meanwhile the petitioner

attacked  upon the complainant  and Major Mohsin with dagger,

injured  them  and  fled away from the scene.  The entire  incident

was witnessed by younger  brother of the complaint  and  other

family  members.

3.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends  that the

petitioner  is innocent  and has falsely been implicated  in this case;

2

Crl. Misc. No.754-Bl2019.

that  the FIR has been  lodged  in order  to deprive  the petitioner

from his custody right of the minor; that challan  has  been

submitted  in the Court  and  the petitioner  is no more  required for

the purpose of further  investigation;  that the injuries  attributed  to

the petitioner  are not grievous in nature,  hence, the petitioner  is

entitled for concession  of post arrest  bail.

4.  Conversely,  learned counsel for respondent No.2  and

learned  State Counsel  contend that  the petitioner  is nominated  in

the FIR with specific allegations  and  even  weapon of offence  has

been  recovered from  him, therefore,  he is not entitled  for

concession  ofpost  arrest  bail.

5.  I have  heard  the arguments and perused  the record.

6.  Tentative assessment of record  reveals that  the petitioner  is

ex-son in law of complainant/respondent No.2 and has been

nominated in case FIR No.309/19, dated 24.09.2019,  U/S

3241452, 337-A(i), 337-A(ii), 337-F(i)  PPC, P.S Lohi  Bher,

Islamabad  with the allegation that he after breaking  the door

entered  in the house of complainant/respondent  No.2 and

attacked upon  respondent No.2  and  his son in law Major Mohsin

through dagger and caused  injuries  to both of them.  The  conduct

of the petitioner prima facie discloses his desperate  character,

who at odd  hours  of the night after scaling  the wall of the house

breaking inside  wooden  door attacked upon  respondent No.2 and

his son in law, which  shows  his intention to commit the crime,

even the weapon  of offlence  has been recovered  on pointation  of

the petitioner.

7.  Cursory glimpse of record further  reflects that similar  type

of incident had taken  place earlier and FIR No.478l2018 was

lodged  with P.S Lohi Bher, Islamabad,  in which the petitioner  is

facing trial and  as such  he has violated  the earlier bail order.  The

offence  with which the petitioner  has been  charged  falls within

3

Crl.  Misc. No.754-Bl2019.

prohibitory  clause  of section 497, CI.P.C  although  it has  been

argued by learned  counsel  for the petitioner  that  injuries  caused

by the petitioner  are simple  in nature.

8.  While considering  the above contention, sufficient  material

is available  on record to connect  the petitioner  with the crime and

ingredients  of section  324, PPC are fully attracted in case in

hand. Even  otherwise  offences  U/S 337-A(ii) is non-bailable and

prima facie  the petitioner has committed  offence  of trespass in

odd  hours of night  and injured respondent  No.2  and his son in

law, which is also non-bailable  and  as such there is no material

ground to extend benefit of further inquiry to the petitioner at this

stage.  The Court  while dealing with  bail matter has only to see

whether the accused is connected with the commission of offence

or not and for such  purpose only tentative  assessment  of

evidence  is to be made and deeper  appreciation is not called for.

The petitioner  was  armed  with deadly weapon  as such he is not

entitled for concession  of bail due to his conduct  and previous

history  and granting  bail at this stage would further  trivialize  the

matter, therefore, while  relying upon 2W

dismissed.  However, learned  Trial Court seized  with the matter is
