ORDER SHEET 
IN THE ISLAMABAD HIGH COURT, ISLAMABAD. 
JUDICIAL DEARTMENT. 

Writ Petition No.1876 of 2021 

Zahid Mehmood 

VS

The Additional District Judge, (East) Islamabad and 05 others. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
proceedings 
28.05.2021  Nemo. 

Case  was  called  in  the  earlier  Court 

hours but  neither the petitioner nor his counsel 

has  put  an  appearance.  The  case  was  kept 

pending  and  was  again  called  in  the  late  hours 

but  situation  is  same.  The  name  of  the  counsel 

for  the  petitioner  is  reflected  in  the  cause  list. 

There  is  no  application  for  an  adjournment, 

therefore,  the  instant  writ  petition  is  dismissed 

for non-prosecution.   

M. Zaheer Janjua.
