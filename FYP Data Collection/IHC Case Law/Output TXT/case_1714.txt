MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KA YANI, J:  Through  the  instant  criminal  revision 

petition,  the  petitioners  have  called in question  order  dated  31.01.2015, whereby

Judicial  Magistrate  was  further  maintained  by  the  learned  Additional  Sessions 

Judge vide impugned  order  dated  30.03.2015. 

2. 

Brief facts referred  in the instant  criminal revision  petition  are that  on the 

complainant  of Muhammad  Ashraf Qureshi/respondent No.1, the  aforesaid  FIR 

No.415/2009  was  registered  against  two  unknown  persons  along  with  two 

co-accused  ladies  for  committing  robbery  with  the  complainant's  family  by 

taking  away  gold  ornaments,  mobile  phones,  cash,  etc.  The  petitioners  were 

implicated  in the  instant  case on the  basis of supplementary  statement  recorded

31.01.2015. Feeling aggrieved  thereof, the  petitioners  preferred  their  appeals, 

which were dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide impugned 

judgment dated 30.03.2015. Hence, the instant criminal revision petition. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  petitioners  contended  that  both  the  Courts  below 

have  erred  in  law  and  convicted  the  petitioners  on  the  basis  of  insufficient 

prosecution evidence; that the impugned judgments of both the Courts below are 

the result  of non-reading  and  mis-reading of the  evidence as  both  the  Courts 

below  have  ignored  the  ingredients  of  the  alleged  offences, regarding  which 

there  is  no  proof  available on  record  against  the  petitioners; that  the  case as 

established by the prosecution is full of doubts but both the Courts below have 

misread the same and  unlawfully convicted the petitioners, therefore, the same 

are liable to be set-aside and petitioners may be acquitted of the charge. 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel  as  well  as  learned  counsel  for 

complainant/respondent  No.1 opposed the instant criminal revision petition and 

contended that  both  the Courts below have rightly appreciated the facts of the 

case and evidence produced by the prosecution; that the recovery of looted gold 

ornaments as well as weapon of offence from the petitioners connects them with 

the commission of offence; that  there is sufficient evidence available on record 

against the petitioners, including the account of eyewitnesses, who  corroborate 

the case as established by the prosecution, on the basis of which both the Courts 

below  have  rightly  convicted  and  sentenced  the  petitioners  vide  impugned 

judgments, therefore, the instant criminal revision petition may be dismissed.

Waris have been convicted in case FIR No.415, dated  28.08.2009, under  Sections

Muhammad  Ashraf Qureshi/ respondent  No.2 being complainant of the 

instant  case has  appeared  as  PW-1 before the  Trial Court  and  stated  that  on 

28.08.2009, at about 8:30 a.m., he left his home for Mardan on his official vehicle 

leaving his two housemaids namely Mst. Shumaila and Mst. Sumaira as well as 

Tasawar Abbas/Chowkidar  in the house and  during  the journey he received a 

telephonic call  from  his  home  informing  him  about  commission  of  robbery, 

whereafter  he  informed  theÂ·  police and  came  back  to  Islamabad  whereby  he 

learnt  that  the  said  two  housemaids  in  connivance  with  two  other  accused 

persons namely Muhammad Waris and Tasawar had tied up his wife as well as 

his children and  snatched away gold ornaments, two mobile phones (Nokia and 

Sony Ericson) as well as cash amounting to Rs.50,000/-, and five star watches on 

gun point. The complaint was converted into FIR Exh.P A.  After the occurrence, 

PW-1 Muhammad  Ashraf  Qureshi/ complainant  while  going  to  Sector G-11, 

Islamabad  with  his  family  saw  both  the  housemaids  along  with  present 

petitioners,  who  were  recognized  and  identified  by  his  family  members, 

whereafter  he  by  informing  the  police has  nominated  those  accused  persons 

through  supplementary  statement.  During  the  course  of  cross-examination, 

PW-1 Muhammad Ashraf Qureshi acknowledged that the accused persons were 

identified by his wife and daughter in Police Station and has also verified the fact 

that accused Munir Ahmad/ petitioner got recovered two gold Karha  (IJS),  three 

chains and  three  rings along with  some other items comprising of earring tops 

and 

cash

side,  whereby  he  admitted  that  the  accused  persons  were  not  known  to  his 

family members earlier, rather they had seen them during the incident. 

8. 

The prosecution  has  produced  the wife of complainant namely Naeema 

Ashraf as PW-2, who  stated  that  on 28.08.2009, the two housemaids called two 

persons in the house, one of whom was armed with pistol, and all four of them 

collectively robbed jewelry, clothes, mobile phones, watches and cash amounting 

to Rs.50,000/- from her while they had  locked her and  her  daughter  in a room 

and fled away while extending life threats. She further stated that they had seen 

the accused persons in Sector G-11 (Kachi Abadi)  after 04  weeks of the incident, 

upon  which the  police arrested  them.  During the  course of cross-examination, 

PW-2 Naeema Ashraf acknowledged that the accused persons were identified in 

jail by her  and  her  daughter  as well. She also identified the recovered jewelry 

articles, however she reiterated that the female accused persons had snatched the 

jewelry while the petitioners being male accused persons had extended threats.

Sadia  Ashraf  i.e.  daughter  of  complainant  appeared  as  PW-3  and 

reiterated  the  stance  of  her  mother  and  father  while  maintaining  that  she 

identified both the housemaids together with the petitioners and contended that 

accused persons had  snatched their mobile phones, cash and jewelry as well as 

they  extended  life  threats.  She further  confirmed that  she  identified  accused 

persons  near  Kachi  Abadi  in  Sector  G-11  after  3 / 4  weeks  of  the  incident, 

whereupon the accused persons were arrested. 

10.

Bibi from her house through Exh.PC. 

11.

12. 

The last witness produced  by the prosecution is PW-6 Jamshed Khan i.e.

14. 

I have minutely attended to the entire evidence and observed that the two 

eyewitnesses namely  PW-2 Naeema Ashraf and  PW-3 Sadia Ashraf remained 

consistent upon the following facts. 

a) 

The  manner  and  mode  in  which  the  incident  took  place  on 

28.08.2009, both the housemaids namely Munaza and Sania as well 

as petitioners namely Munir Ahmad and  Muhammad Waris were 

identified. 

b) 

Both the  eyewitnesses namely  PW-2 Naeema  Ashraf  and  PW-3 

Sadia  Ashraf  verified  the  fact  that  their  jewelry  articles, mobile 

phones, cash amounting to Rs.50,000/- and watches were snatched, 

whereas the petitioners extended life threats on gun point. 

c) 

The  recovered  jewelry  articles  have  been  identified  by  PW-2 

Naeema Ashraf. 

d) 

Both the  eyewitnesses i.e. PW-2 Naeema Ashraf and  PW-3 Sadia 

Ashraf on seeing all the accused persons after 04 weeks of incident 

near Kachi Abadi, Sector G-11, Islamabad had informed the police, 

whereafter the accused persons were arrested. 

e) 

The  accused persons  have  been  identified through  identification 

parade  proceedings  in  jail,  but  no  such  record  is  available  on 

record,  whereas  the  eyewitnesses  have  identified  the  accused 

persons before the Trial Court. 

15.  Keeping in view the  above position, the  star witnesses, who  are natural 

and  having  no  animosity against the  petitioners, have  properly  identified the 

petitioners after the incident and on their information the accused persons were 

arrested by the police, whereafter they led to recovery of gold jewelry, .30 bore 

pistol  and  cash  amount,  which  has  been  placed  on  record  through  Exh.PB, 

Exh.PC,  Exh.PD,  Exh.PE  and  Exh.PF.  The  recovery  proceedings  have 

independently  been  proved 

through 

the 

testimony  of  PW-4  Asima 

Crl.  Revision  No.50/2015 

Page  I  7 

Bibi/Constable,  PW-5  Kifayat  Ullah/HC  and  PW-6  Jamshed  Akhtar/LO., 

wherein  no discrepancy  has been noted, who remained  consistent  on all scores. 

16. 

I  have  taken  into  account  the  defence  plea  of  the  petitioners,  which  is 

silent qua  any justified  reason.  Both the courts below have  given  detailed  stance 

while  appreciating  evidence  available  on  record  in  which  the  alleged  incident 

dated  28.08.2009 was  proved  to  be  committed  by  petitioners  as  well  as  by  the 

housemaids,  who  have  absconded  during  the  course  of  trial.  Both  the  Courts 

below have rightly  appreciated  the evidence produced  by the prosecution,  which 

also fulfills the  requirements  of Article 40 of the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984 

and  as such,  the  defence  has  failed  to justify  any  previous  animosity,  motive  or 

false  implication,  on  the  basis  of  which  the  petitioners  have  rightly  been 

convicted by the learned  Trial Court,  even otherwise,  the findings  are concurrent 

and no illegality has been observed. 

17. 

The  requirements  of  offence  under  Section  392  PPC  are  visible  from 

record,  whereby 

the  petitioners  have  carried  away 

the  property  of  the 

complainant,  PW-2 Naeema  Ashraf  and  PW-3 Sadia Ashraf  by way  of extortion 

on gun  point,  which  was  later  on also recovered  on the pointation  of petitioners, 

therefore, nothing  is to be presumed  in favour  of petitioners,  who have also been 

declared  guilty by two courts below. 

18. 

Keeping  in  view  the  above  position,  the  captioned  criminal  revision 

petition  filed  by  petitioners  is hereby  DISMISSED.  Both the  petitioners  are  on 

bail, they be taken  into custody  to serve their remaining  sentence.
