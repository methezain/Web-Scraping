l2l

complainanfs wife called 15 Rescue Police  and FIR has been

lodged.

3. 

Learned counsel for  petitioner  contends  that

petitioner  has falsely  been  implicated in this case as he was

not involved in the alleged  incident  and the case has been

registered with malafide intention;  that petitioner is also

owner  of the land  and matter in dispute is of civil nature; that

all the offences  are bailable except Section  452 PPC, which

does not attract  in the circumstances  of the case.

4. 

Conversely, learned counsel  for complainant  as well

as State Counsel contends  that petitioner is a habitual

criminal  as 09 other  FIRs have also been lodged  against  him

in P.S. Ramna,  Islamabad on similar  charges  of interference

and possession  as well as fraud qua the land and as such, he

is a land  grabber. Leamed  counsel for complainant further

contends that the evidence  collected  by brvestigation  Officer

in this case  demonstrates  that petitioner  along with his

co-accused  persons demolished  the walls and one of the

accused namely Nasir Shah is still absconder in this  matter.

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard,  record  perused.

Perusal of record reveals that petitioner  is nominated

accused  in case  FIR No.85,  dated  13.07.2019, under  Section

506(ii),  511,,  452, M7, 1.47, '1'49  PPC, P.S. Shams  Colony,

Islamabad and has been charged with offence  of trespassing

into a 06 marla plot owned  by complainant. The tentative

assessment of record  reveals  that petitioner along-with 04

others, armed  with weapons  and iron rods, demolished  the

compound  walls of plot and broken  the gate by use of force

and tried to grab the land in question.

7. 

As per record placed before  this Court,09 other  cases

of similar nature are registered  against  petitioner in P.S.

Ramna,  Islamabad. The petitioner  has failed to demonstrate

the malafide  intention on the part of complainant  and police,

even no question of further inquiry  has been brought  on

record and as such, the petitioner  is directly charged  with the

offence  of house  trespassing  by putting the complainant  and

his family  members in fear, whereas no case  of mal#ide  is

visible  at this stage.

8. 

In view of above circumstances,  the instant pre-arrest

bail application is DISMISSED.  The interim pre-arrest

bail granted to petitioner  vide order dated 02.08.2019 is

herebv REC,ILLED.
