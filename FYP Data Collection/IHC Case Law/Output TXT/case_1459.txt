GhulamAzamQambrani,J:    Through  this  petition,  the 

petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 

of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  with  the 

following prayer:- 

“It 

is,  therefore,  humbly  prayed  that  on 
acceptance of this writ petition, the impugned divorce 
certificate  dated  28.11.2018  issued  by  the  Chairman 
Arbitration  Council, 
Islamabad,  may  please  be 
cancelled and set-aside. 

Any  other  appropriate  remedy,  which  this 
Hon’ble  Court  deems

petitioner.”  

fit  and  proper

2. 

Briefly stated, facts of the instant petition are that the petitioner 

had  announced  divorce  to  the  respondent  No.2  vide  divorce  deed 

dated  28.08.2018.  After  execution  of  said  divorce  deed,  the 

petitioner  applied  to  the  respondent  No.1  for  issuance  of  certificate 

of effectiveness of divorce according to provisions of Muslim Family 

Laws  Ordinance,  1961  through  application  dated  30.08.2018.  The 

petitioner  also  engaged  a  counsel  to  proceed  with  the  pending 

proceeding.  On  26.09.2018,  statement  of 

the  petitioner  was 

recorded before the respondent No.1. Petitioner revoked his divorce 

deed  vide  revocation  deed  dated  17.10.2018  and  reconciled  with 

respondent  No.2  on  the  interference  of  elders  of  both  the  families 

well  before  the  next  date  of  hearing  before  respondent  No.1.  The 

petitioner  accordingly 

informed  his  counsel  about 

the  same 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

“W.P No.3360 of 2020” 

revocation  deed  and  reconciliation  with  respondent  No.2  in  a 

meeting  and  asked  him  to  withdraw  the  application  filed  under 

Section  7,ibid,  much  earlier  than  the  expiry  of  90  days  period.After 

execution  of  above  mentioned  revocation  deed  and  reconciliation, 

petitioner started living with respondent No.2 happily. Surprisingly, in 

the  month  of  June,  2020,  the  petitioner  came  to  know  that  the 

respondent  No.1  issued  a  divorce  certificate  dated  28.11.2018  and 

his learned counsel had forgotten qua the case of petitioner pending 

with  respondent  No.1  due  to  rush  of  work.  The  petitioner  at  the 

earliest  applied  to  respondent  No.1  for  the  cancellation  of  divorce 

deed  vide  application  dated  19.06.2020,  however  the  office  of 

respondent  No.1  straight  away  refused  by  saying  that  there  is  no 

provision of cancellation of divorce certificate, hence this petition.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  contended  that  the 

impugned  action  of  respondent  No.1  is  without  lawful  authority  and 

against the principles of natural justice; that the respondent No.1 has 

failed to appreciate the points involved in case in its real perspective 

while  refusing  to  entertain  the  application  of  petitioner;  that  the 

petitioner  already  revoked  the  divorce  deed  dated  17.10.2018  well 

within prescribed period of ninety days; that the impugned action of 

respondent No.1 for refusing to entertain the application of petitioner 

without  any  written  findings  is  tenable.  Further  contended  that  the 

petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  is  ready  to  appear  before  this 

Hon‟ble  Court  for  recording  their  respective  statements  regarding 

their  re-conciliation  and  revocation  of  divorce  deed.  Lastly,  prayed 

for acceptance of instant petition. 

4. 

Conversely, 

learned  counsel 

for 

respondent  No.1  has 

opposed the contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioner 

by contending that the petitioner submittedapplication for issuance of 

divorce  effectiveness  certificate;  that  he  appointed  a  “Salis”  for  him 

as  required  under  the  Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961;  that 

after  adopting  due  process,  proclamation 

in  newspaper  was 

published  for  appearance  of  respondent  No.2;that  the  petitioner 

appeared  on  26.09.2018  before  the  respondent  No.1  and  recorded 

his  statement  that  the  reconciliation  between  the  parties  has  been 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3 

“W.P No.3360 of 2020” 

failed;  that  the  petitioner  did  not  intimate  the  respondent  about  the 

revocation of divorce deed dated 17.10.2018; that the petitioner did 

not  pursue  the  matter  and  finally  after  expiry  of  ninety  days,  the 

divorce  effectiveness  certificate  was  issued  on  30.11.2018.  Lastly, 

he urged for dismissal of petition. 

5. 

I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties 

and  have  perused  the  material  available  on  record  with  their  able 

assistance. 

6. 

Perusal of the petition reveals that the petitioner was married 

to  the  respondent  No.2  Mst.  SundalHammad.  On  28.08.2018,  the 

petitioner  pronounced  “Talaq”  to  her.On  30.08.2018,  thepetitioner 

filed  an  application  to  the  respondent  No.1  (Chairman  Arbitration 

Council-ICT,  Islamabad)  for  issuance  of  certificate  of  effectiveness 

of  divorce  under  the  provisions  of  Muslim  Family  Laws  Ordinance, 

1961, who declared divorce effective vide order dated 28.11.2018. It 

is the case of petitioner that he engaged a counsel to proceed with 

the  matter  before  the  respondent  No.1  and  executed  wakalatnama 

and authority letter to his counsel. The respondent No.1 proceeded 

with  the  matter  and  on  26.09.2018,  recorded  his  statement  and 

thereafter  issued  notice  for  appearance  of  respondent  No.2  for 

24.10.2018. 

In 

the  meantime,  petitioner  revoked 

the  above 

mentioned  divorce-deed  vide revocation  deed dated 17.10.2018 on 

the  intervention  of  elders  of  both  families  and  reconciled  with 

respondent  No.2.  It  was  also  contended  by  the  petitioner  that  he 

informed  his  counsel  about  reconciliation  with  the  respondent  No.2 

and execution of revocation deed with a request to learned counsel 

to  withdraw  the  application  under  Section  7,  ibid,filed  before  the 

respondent  No.1  and  before  expiry  of  ninety  days,  he  revoked  the 

divorce  deed.  After  execution  of  revocation  deed,  he  started  living 

with respondent No.2.In the month of June, 2020, he came to know 

that  respondent  No.1  had  issued  a  divorce  effectiveness  certificate 

on  28.11.2018,  as  the  counsel  for  petitioner  did  not  pursue  the 

matter  before  the  respondent  No.1  and  did  not  inform  about  the 

revocation-deed,  which 

resulted 

into 

issuance  of  divorce 

effectiveness  certificate.  The  petitioner  on  19.06.2020,  after  having 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

“W.P No.3360 of 2020” 

knowledge  of  issuance  of  the  certificate  filed  an  application  before 

the  respondent  No.1  for  cancellation  of  the  above  certificate  which 

was  not  entertained,  which  necessitated  him 

to 

invoke 

the 

constitutional jurisdiction of this court.  

7. 

Perusal of record shows that the respondent No.2 was issued 

notice  by  the  respondent  No.1  and  the  matter  was  fixed  for 

24.10.2018.  On  the  said  date,  counsel  for  the  petitioner  was  in 

attendance  while  respondent  No.2  was  absent  and  the  matter  was 

adjourned for 14.11.2018. On the said date, none of the parties was 

in  attendance  and  proclamation  published  in  the  newspaper  was 

received  and  the  matter  was  adjourned  for  22.11.2018.  Then  on 

22.11.2018, none of the parties put in appearance, hence the matter 

was  postponed  to  28.11.2018.  Perusal  of  order  dated  28.11.2018 

shows that after publication and failure of reconciliation proceedings, 

divorce effectiveness certificate was issued.  

8. 

 The  petitioner  filed  application  for  cancellation  of  Talaq 

certificate dated 30.11.2018 on the ground that divorce had already 

been revoked vide revocation deed dated 17.10.2018, but the same 

was not entertained. According to Section 7 of Muslim Family Laws 

Ordinance,  1961  a  man  ,  who  wishes  to  divorce  his  wife  shall,  as 

soon  as,  may  be  after  pronouncement  of  talaq  in  any  form 

whatsoever,  give  the  Chairman  notice in  writing  of his  having  done 

so, and shall supply copy thereof to his wife. A talaq unless revoked 

earlier shall  not  be effective until the  expiration of ninety  days  from 

the  day  on  which  notice  is  delivered  to  the  Chairman.  Section  7  is 

reproduced herein below:-

9. 

In  the  case  in  hand,  the  petitioner  revoked  the  divorce  vide 

revocation deed dated 17.10.2018, but same was not placed before 

the  respondent  No.1  well  in  time  and  it  was  not  brought  into  the 

knowledge  of 

the  Council,  which 

issued 

the 

impugned 

order/certificate. The petitioner placed on record a „fatwa‟ issued by 

Shuhuba-e-  Istafsarat,  International  Islamic  University,  Islamabad. 

After pronouncement of one talaq, the petitioner has made “Rajooh” 

to respondent No.2, which is in accordance with shariah. 

10.  From the language employed in subsection (3) of Section 7 of 

1961  Ordinance,  it  is  abundantly  clear that a  Talaq  unless  revoked 

earlier expressly or otherwise, shall not be effective, until expiration 

of 90 days from the day on which notice under sub-section (1) was 

delivered  to  the  Chairman  Arbitration  Council  or  Chairman  Union 

Council,  as  the  case  may  be.  Thus  the  provision  of  law  supra 

provides a room by using the word expressly or otherwise, that even 

Talaq can be revoked by  way of a written instrument  or orally  or in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

“W.P No.3360 of 2020” 

any  other  mode.  The  case  of 

the  petitioner 

is 

that 

the 

Talaqpronounced  by  himhad  already  been  revoked  vide  aDeed  of 

Revocation dated 17.10.2018 which fact was communicated by him 

to  his  counsel 

instructing  him 

to  withdraw 

the  notice  of 

Talaqsubjudice  before  theArbitration  Council/respondent  No.1,  but 

his  counsel  failed  todo  the  needful  within  the  prescribed  limitation, 

per  in-curium  statedly  owing  to  his  pre-professional  engagement 

resulting 

intoissuance  of 

the 

impugned  divorce  effectiveness 

certificate. Thus, obviously it is negligence on the part of the counsel 

and  not  the  party/husband,  which  culminated  into  creation  of  an 

unwanted  situation  thereby  necessitating  them  to  invoke  the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  court.There  is  no  denial  to  the  fact 

that according to the injunctions of Islam, if husbandmakes “Rajooh” 

to  his  wife  before  expiry  of  90  days,  the  divorce  proceedings  will 

stand  annulled.In  the  case  in  hand,  revocation  deed  was  executed 

by  the petitioner much before expiry of the 90 days and the couple 

started  residing 

together  as  husband  and  wife  within 

limits 

prescribed  byAllah  Almighty  and  are  apparentlyleading  a  happy 

matrimonial life, consequent whereof, the divorce proceedings stood 

abated and are no more in existence. 

11.  There  is  no  dispute  qua  revocation  of  divorce  by  the 

petitioner.The  only  proposition  involved  in  this  case  is  that  whether 

non-communication  of  factum  of  revocation  of  divorce  to  the 

Arbitration  Council/respondent  No.1,  has  rendered  the  revocation 

process invalid or redundant or not?The law on the subject isthat in 

case  of  clash  between  an  existing  law  and  the  injunctions  of  Islam 

with regard  to  validity  of  marriage, injunctions  of  Islam  shall  prevail 

for the purpose of 1961 Ordinance. I am fortified in my view from the 

law 

enunciated 

in 

1997 

P.Cr.L.J 

1655 

Federal 

ShariatCourt(Muhammad  Siddique  and  another  VS  the  State).This 

being  the  legal  situation,  I  am  of  the  irresistible  viewthat  since  the 

divorce  notice  was  revoked  before  expiry  of  90  days  by  the 

petitioner/husband  with  his  free  will  and  consent  and  he  was  very 

much competent to do so according to Shariah as well as the law of 

land, 

therefore,mere  non-communication  of 

the  same 

to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

“W.P No.3360 of 2020” 

theArbitration  Council  do  not  invalidate  the  revocation  process  nor 

break the marriage bond. 

12.  For  what  has  been  observed  hereinabove,  this  petition  is 

allowed, 

resultantly, 

the 

impugneddivorce 

effectiveness 

certificatedated 28.11.2018 issued by respondent No.1 is set-aside.
