21.09.2022.  Mis  Rakshanda  Azhar  and  Akseer  Ahmed 

Abbasi,  Advocates  for Petitioner. 
Mr.  Mazhar  UI  Haq  Hashmi,  Advocate  for 
Respondent  No.2. 

Through 

the 

instant 

petition, 

the 

Petitioner  [Mst.  Afshan  Qazi]  has  assailed  the 

Order  dated  13.07.2016  ("Impugned  Order  I") 

and  Order  dated  15.11.2016 

("Impugned 

Order  JI")  passed  by  the  Respondent  No.1 

[Judge  Family  Court,  (West)  Islamabad]. 

2.  The  learned  counsel 

for  the  Petitioner 

submits  that  the  Petitioner  had  ft led  suit  for 

recovery 

of  maintenance 

allowance 

on 

17.07.2012  against 

the  Respondent  No.  2, 

which  was  decided  on  31.03.2016.  Thereafter 

Respondent  No.  2  filed  an  application  under 

Section  476  Cr.P.C  against 

the  Petitioner, 

wherein 

the 

two 

Impugned  Orders  dated 

13.07.2016  and  15.11.2016  were  passed. 

3..  The  learned  counsel 

for  the  Petitioner 

submits  that  an  application  was  moved  by  the 

Respondent  No.2  for provision  of bank  record 

of  the  Petitioner  which  was  irrelevant  to  the 

proceedings 

under  Section 

476  Cr.P.C. 

2 

W.P.  No.34412017 

Despite 

the  foregoing, 

the  Impugned  Order  I 

was  passed  wherein 

the  concerned  bank  was 

directed 

to  provide 

the  requisite 

record  of  the 

Petitioner  in  court. 

In  so  far  as  the  Impugned 

Order 

II  dated  15 .1  1.2016 

is  concerned, 

the 

learned  counsel 

for  the  Petitioner  argued 

that 

the  bank  record  could  have  been  submitted  by 

the  Respondent  No.  2  himself  and  even 

otherwise  has  no  nexus  with  the  proceedings 

pursuant 

to  the  application  under  Section  4 76 

Cr.P.C. 

4.  On  the  other  hand  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  Respondent  No.2 

submits 

that 

the  suit 

filed  by  the  Petitioner  was  disposed  of  and  the 

Respondent  No.2 

rs  paying  maintenance 

regularly 

therefore 

the 

instant  writ  may  be 

dismissed. 

5. 

I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel 

for  the 

parties  and  as  noted  above, 

the  issue  pertains 

to 

the  orders 

passed 

in 

respect 

of 

the 

proceedings 

initiated 

pursuant 

to 

the 

application  under  Section  476  Cr.P.C.,  which 

was  filed  after  disposal  of the  suit  for  recovery 

of maintenance 

filed  by  the  Petitioner. 

6. 

Be  that  as  it  may,  the  Impugned  Order 

I 

dated  13.07.2016  whereby 

the  concerned  bank 

was  directed 

to  provide 

the  requisite  record  of 

the  Petitioner  has  already  been  complied  with 

and  such  report  was  received  by  the  learned 

Family  Court 

as  noted 

in  order 

dated 

06.10.2016, 

whereas 

the 

instant 

writ 

3 

W.P.  No.3./412017 

challenging 

the  Impugned  Order  I  was  filed  in 

January,  2017  as  such  it  was  infructuous 

to  the 

extent  of Impugned  Order 

r  dated  13 .07.2016. 

7. 

In  so  far  as  the  Impugned  Order  II  dated 

15.11.2016 

is  concerned,  perusal  of  the  same 

shows 

that  by  way  of  such  order  Respondent 

No.2  was  directed 

to  bring  documents 

to  the 

concerned  bank  whereas  bank  was  directed 

to 

verify 

the 

same 

and 

submit 

its 

report 

regarding 

genumeness 

of 

the  documents 

thereafter.  Be  that  as  it  may,  summoning  of 

bank  record  of  Respondent  No.2  and  seeking 

verification 

thereof  from  such  bank  does  not 

prejudice 

of  the  Petitioner 

in  any  manner 

whatsoever 

and 

as 

such 

she 

is  not  an 

aggrieved  party. 

8. 

In  view  of  the  above 

the  writ  petition 

is 

dismissed.
