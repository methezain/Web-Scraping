15.09.2020  at  about  05:00  a.m. 

the 

respondent  No.  1  along  with  his  companions 

while  armed  with  lethal  weapons  broke  into 

 
 
3 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

the  property  of  the  complainant  and  while 

holding  the  caretaker  of  the  complainant  on 

the  basis of  lethal weapons  constrained  them 

from  one  built  room  of  the  complainant  and 

occupied  half  of 

the 

land 

illegally  and 

unlawfully  with  the 

intention 

to 

illegally 

disposes  the  complainant  for  the  purpose  of 

illegal 

occupation 

and 

two 

of 

the 

representatives  of  the  complainant  forcibly 

ousted  from  the  land.  Complaint  was  filed 

against  the  respondent  No.  1  /  Syed  Mati 

Ullah  to  SHO,  Police  Station  Shahzad  Town, 

Islamabad  but  no  action  was 

taken. 

Thereafter,  the  petitioner  filed  a  complaint 

under  Section  3  &  4  of 

the 

Illegal 

Dispossession  Act, 

2005 

against 

the 

respondent  No.  1,  whereby  the  impugned 

order  dated  30.04.2021  was  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District  &  Sessions  Judge-

III, East-Islamabad.  

03.  Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia,  contends  that  the  impugned  order  has 

been  passed  in  a  slipshod  &  hasty  manner 

without  considering  the  facts  and  merits 

available  on  record,  hence  is  liable  to  be  set 

 
 
4 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

aside  &  remanded  back  for  decision  afresh;  

learned  Additional  District  &  Sessions  Judge 

has  exercised  his  jurisdiction  with  material 

irregularity, whereby he failed to consider the 

fact  that  petitioner  has  not  only  mentioned 

specific date and time of the dispossession by 

the  respondent  No.  1  from  the  subject 

property  but  also  failed  to  consider  the 

question  of  title  of  the  petitioner  over  the 

subject  land,  nor  afforded  an  opportunity  to 

the  petitioner  to  further  corroborate  his  case 

by  producing  oral  as  well  as  documentary 

evidence. 

04.  Learned  Additional  District  &  Sessions 

Judge has failed to consider the provisions of 

the  Illegal  Dispossession  Act,  2015,  which 

were  especially  applicable  to  the  case  of 

respondent  No.  1,  as  it  is  settled  law  that 

provisions  of  said  Act  not  only  apply  to  the 

land grabbers, Qabza groups or other persons 

habitually  indulging  in  such  activities  but  also 

to  all  persons 

illegally  occupying  or 

in 

possession  of  any  premises;  the  learned 

Additional  District  &  Sessions  Judge  erred  in 

law  while  dismissing  the  complaint  on  the 

 
 
5 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

touch  stone  of  pendency  of  Civil  disputes 

without  considering  &  appreciating  the  Illegal 

Dispossession  Act,  2005  which  was  specially 

aimed  to  provide  remedy  for  grievance  of 

Illegal  Possession  and  forcible  /  wrongful 

dispossession, 

therefore, 

such 

complaint 

would be maintainable regardless of pendency 

of  any  civil litigation;  the  Additional  District  & 

Sessions  Judge  has  erred  in  law  while  not 

adopting due  legal  procedure in  its  true  spirit 

and  perspective  and  has  committed  material 

irregularity and illegality, therefore, impugned 

order, in circumstances could not be sustained 

as  legal  or  speaking  order  on  merits  and  has 

prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the  impugned 

order dated 30.04.2021. 

05.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

respondent  No.  1  has  contended  that  the 

impugned order has rightly been passed; it is 

admitted by the petitioner that he is co-sharer 

in  disputed  property  with  respondent  No.  1; 

miscellaneous litigation between the parties is 

pending;  no  legal  and  cogent  evidence  was 

produced by the petitioner and has prayed for 

dismissal of the instant revision petition. 

 
 
6 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

06.  Learned  counsel 

for 

the  applicant, 

Sheikh  Adnan  Ahmed  has  contended that  the 

petitioner  has  concealed  the  actual  material 

facts,  as  the  civil  litigation  in  different  civil 

Courts is pending between the parties and the 

petitioner  with  malafide  intention  did  not 

implead  Sheikh  Adnan  Ahmed  as  respondent. 

The  petitioner  is  co-owner  of  the  compact 

block of land mentioned in the complaint, the 

plot has also been sold to different parties and 

has stated that just in order to settle score of 

civil  litigation  the  complaint  was  filed  which 

has  rightly  been  dismissed  by  the  learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge-III,  Islamabad  vide 

impugned judgment dated 30.04.2021.  

07.  Arguments advanced by learned counsel 

for  the  petitioner,  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondent  and 

learned  counsel 

for  the 

applicant  /  Sheikh  Adnan  Ahmed  have  been 

heard, and record has been perused with their 

able assistance. 

08.  Complaint was filed on 18.12.2020, it is 

mentioned in Para 4 of the complaint that on 

15.09.2020  at  about  05:00  a.m.  respondent 

No.  1  allegedly  with  unknown  accused 

 
 
7 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

persons  armed  with  lethal  weapons  entered 

upon the subject land and unlawfully confined 

the caretaker / guard alongwith his family in a 

built  room  on  the  subject  land.  Subsequently 

half of land of the petitioner was illegally and 

unlawfully  occupied,  with  the  intention  to 

dispossess the petitioner from subject land.  

09.  Cursory  statement of  the  petitioner  was 

recorded on 19.12.2020, the complainant has 

also  mentioned  the  date  of  occurrence  in  his 

statement  before 

the  Court  of 

learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge-III,  East-Islamabad 

as  15.09.2020  but  surprisingly 

filed  an 

application  in  the  month  of  January,  2021 

wherein  it  is  mentioned  that  in  the  complaint 

due  to  some  clerical  mistakes  wrong  date  of 

occurrence  i.e.  15.11.2020  was  mentioned 

rather  correct  date  of  occurrence  was 

15.09.2020  and  has  requested  for  correction 

of  date  of  occurrence  from  15.11.2020  to 

15.09.2020.  The  reason  for  mentioning  of 

wrong  date  of  occurrence  was  mentioned  as 

inadvertent 

/  clerical  mistake  but 

the 

petitioner  has  not  given  any  explanation  that 

why  he  has  stated  the  wrong  date  of 

 
 
8 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

occurrence  in  his  statement  recorded  by  the 

learned  Trial  Court  on  19.12.2020.  The 

learned  trial  Court  has  directed  vide  order 

dated  19.12.2020  to  the  SHO  for  submission 

of report on the following points: 

“i.  Whether  complainant  was  in 

possession of the suit property at or before 

time of occurrence ? 

ii.  Whether the alleged occurrence took 

place  on  or  prior  as  narrated  in  the 

complaint ? 

iii.  Whether  the  respondent  No.  1  is 

occupying the suit property in consequence 

of the above said occurrence, if so, then in 

what capacity ?” 

10.  The  petitioner  has  shown  his  no 

confidence  on  the  SHO  vide  his  application 

dated 04.01.2021 and has prayed for issuance 

of  direction  to  some  honest  senior  police 

officer  of  the  area,  subsequently  DSP  of  the 

area  being  senior  police  officer  was  assigned 

the task to submit report on the points stated 

above. The petitioner again has shown his no 

confidence  on  DSP  of  the  area  /  Shahzad 

Town,  vide  his  application  dated  26.01.2021 

 
 
9 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

and  has  prayed  for  assigning  the  task  to  an 

officer not below the rank of SP. 

11.  The DSP Sihala, Circle was assigned the 

task  for  the  third  time  for  submitting  report 

regarding the above mentioned direction, who 

after  recording  the  statements  has  not  given 

clear  report  regarding  the  land  grabbing  etc. 

rather  shows  his  suspicion  regarding  the 

occurrence  and  stated  that  even  police  could 

not understand the stance of the parties. 

12.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

verbally 

stated 

that 

the  matter  was 

immediately reported to Rescue 15 but neither 

any  such  record  has  been  annexed  with  the 

instant petition nor produced before the court 

during  recording  of  cursory  evidence.  The 

petitioner  in  his  cursory  statement  has  not 

even  mentioned  the  name  of  respondent  No. 

1, that he took forcible possession rather only 

stated  at 

the  end  of  statement 

that 

respondent  along  with  his  companions  has 

taken  the  possession  forcibly.  The  petitioner 

has  not  stated  in  his  cursory  statement  that 

respondent  No.  1  was  a  land  grabber  or 

having any other criminal history.  

 
 
10 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

13.  The  petitioner  has admitted  in  Para  No. 

9  of  his  complaint  filed  before  the  Court  of 

learned Additional Sessions Judge that “in fact 

a  suit  for  declaration  and  permanent 

injunction  was  filed  by  one  Sheik  Adnan 

Ahmed, wherein he opted that possession of 

the land is with him, the suit is pending 

adjudication before Mr. Rizwan-ud-Din learned 

Civil Judge, Islamabad and on the contrary a 

suit for cancellation of the sale deed, filed by 

the petitioner is also pending in the Court of 

Mr.  Hafeez  Ahmed,  learned  Civil  Judge, 

Islamabad which is fixed for 07.01.2021. As 

mentioned  above,  in  fact  he  had  no 

occupation of 01 cm land and there was 

probability  of  filing  of  application  for 

transmission of local commission to report for 

possession of either party hence Shiekh Adnan 

managed agreement dated 03.01.2020 with 

the respondent of the case to maneuver and 

knit the story of possession over the plot 

hence the land is illegally occupied by the 

respondent on the basis of lethal weapons for 

which they have no right whatsoever and are 

liable to be dealt with iron hands”.   

 
 
11 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

14.  Pendency  of  civil  litigation  between  the 

parties  is  admitted  by  the  petitioner,  if  the 

occurrence  of  forcible  possession  took  place 

on  15.09.2020  then  why  the  petitioner  kept 

silent for more than a period of 3 months and 

filed a complaint on 18.12.2020. 

15.  The petitioner has also not stated in his 

cursory statement that he filed any application 

to  the  concerned  police  station.  In  cursory 

statement  the  petitioner  has  mentioned  that 

he  has  produced  12  documents  which  were 

exhibited from Ex.C-1 to C-11 and Mark-A, but 

the  said  documents  have  not  been  annexed 

with the instant petition, even certified copies 

of  different  petitions  filed  in  the  Court,  order 

dated 

04.01.2021 

passed 

by 

learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge  have  not  been 

enclosed  with  the  petition  rather  photocopies 

of the judicial record / orders with a stamp of 

certified true copy by the learned counsel has 

been  annexed  which  are  not  permissible 

under the law.  

16.  There is no cavil to the proposition  that 

complaint  under  Illegal  Dispossession  Act, 

2005  is  maintainable  against  any  person  who 

 
 
12 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

forcibly  dispossess  the  occupier  or  owner  but 

such  remedy  is  never  meant  to  settle  civil 

dispute  or  substitute  for  civil  dispute  herein 

this case the petitioner has admitted that the 

litigation / civil suits are pending between the 

parties.  

17.  Further  provision  of  Section  3 

is 

applicable  only  to  land  grabbers.  Reliance  is 

placed on the case titled as “Habibullah and 

others  VS  Abdul  Manan  and  others” 

(2012 SCMR 1533),  wherein  it  has  been 

held as under: 

“it is established that the said law is 

applicable  only  to  those  accused 

persons who have the credentials or 

antecedents of Qabza Group and are 

involved  in  illegal  activities  and 

belong to the gang of land grabbers or 

land mafia.”. Reliance is also placed on 

a case titled as “Zahoor Ahmed and 5 

others VS The State and 3 others” 

(PLD 2007 231 [Lahore]). 

18. 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Mumtaz Hussain 

VS Dr. Nasir Khan and others” (2010 

SCMR 1254),  the  Hon’ble  Supreme Court  of 

Pakistan  has  provided  guidelines  for  the 

Courts to examine that: 

“For  the  purposes  of  attracting 

 
 
13 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

provisions  of  S.3  of  Illegal 

Dispossession Act, 2005, court is 

required to examine as to whether 

property  was  an  immovable 

property; secondly that the person 

was owner or the property was in 

his lawful possession; thirdly that 

accused entered into or upon the 

property unlawfully; fourthly that 

such entry was with intention to 

dispossess  i.e.  ouster,  evict  or 

deriving out of possession against 

the  will  of  person  in  actual 

possession or to grab i.e. capture, 

seize  suddenly,  take  greedily  or 

unfairly,  or  to  control  i.e.  to 

exercise power or influence over 

regulate  or  govern  or  relates  to 

authority over what is not in one's 

physical possession or to occupy 

i.e. holding possession, reside in or 

something”. 

19. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of Pakistan  in  a  case titled  as 

“Bashir Ahmed VS Additional Sessions 

Judge, Faisalabad and 4 others” (PLD 

2010 SC 661), that: 

“It has been conceded before us by 

the learned counsel for the petitioner 

that no material is available with the 

petitioner 

to  establish 

that 

respondents Nos. 2 to 4 belonged to 

 
 
14 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

any Qabza group or land mafia or 

that  they  had  the  credentials  or 

antecedents  of  being  property 

grabbers. In view of the discussion 

made above the impugned acquittal 

or respondents Nos. 2 to 4 recorded 

by  the  learned  Additional  Sessions 

Judge, Faisalabad upon acceptance of 

their  application  submitted  under 

section  265-K,  Cr.  P.  C.  has  been 

found by us to be entirely justified 

and dismissal of the petitioner's writ 

petition by the learned Judge of the 

Lahore high Court, Lahore has also 

been  found  by  us  to  be 

unexceptionable. 

In 

the 

circumstances of this case mentioned 

above  we  have  entertained  an 

irresistible impression that through 

filing  of  his  complaint  under  the 

Illegal Dispossession Act, 2005 the 

petitioner had tried to transform a 

bona fide civil dispute between the 

parties into a criminal case so as to 

bring the weight of criminal law and 

process  to  bear  upon  respondents 

Nos.  2  to  4  in  order  to  extract 

concessions  from  them.  Such 

utilization of the criminal law and 

process by the petitioner has been 

found by us to be an abuse of the 

process  of  law  which  cannot  be 

allowed to be perpetuated”. 

20.  As  the  petitioner  has  failed  to  produce 

any  legal  and  cogent  evidence  in  support  of 

 
 
15 

Criminal Revision No. 29 of 2021 

his  contention,  mentioned  different  dates  of 

occurrence  and  has  also  not  filed  documents 

with  the  instant  petition  in  accordance  with 

law,  civil  litigation  is  pending  between  the 

parties,  hence  the  instant  Revision  Petition  is 

dismissed being meritless.
