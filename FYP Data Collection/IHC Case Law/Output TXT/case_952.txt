Raja Arshad Abbasi, Advocate for the 
petitioner.  

The  petitioner,  in  the  instant  petition,  has 

assailed order dated 18.10.2014 whereby suit for 

dissolution  of  marriage  through  Khula  filed  by 

respondent  No.1  was  allowed  and  the  marriage 

was accordingly dissolved.   

2. 

At the very outset, learned counsel for the 

petitioner  was 

confronted 

as 

to 

the 

maintainability of the instant petition on the basis 

of  laches  as  the  impugned  order  is  dated 

18.10.2014.  In  response  to  the  same,  learned 

counsel 

for 

the  petitioner  contended 

that 

petitioner’s  father  was 

indisposed  and 

the 

petitioner  had  been  engaged  in  other  litigation 

with respondent No.1 vis-à-vis the custody of the 

children  etc. hence the instant petition could not 

be  filed.  It  was  further  contended  that  the 

impugned  order  is  untenable  inasmuch  as  is  in 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.3879 of 2021

violation of basic provisions of the law.  

3. 

Arguments  advanced  by 

the 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  have  been  heard  and 

the  documents  placed  on  record  examined  with 

his able assistance. 

4. 

As  noted  above,  respondent  No.1  sought 

dissolution of marriage through Khula which suit 

was  allowed  vide  judgment  and  decree  dated 

18.10.2014.  In  this  behalf  the  marriage  was 

dissolved by way of Khula subject to restoration 

of  dower.  Learned counsel for the petitioner has 

not been able to provide any plausible reason for 

condoning  the  delay  in  approaching  this  Court. 

The petition, under Article 199 of Constitution of 

the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, is by way 

of equitable remedy and it is established principle 

that  equity  favours  the  vigilant  rather  than 

indolent.  A  right  has  accrued  in  favour  of 

respondent No.1 by virtue of the impugned order; 

the  vires  of  which  can  only  be  examined  if  the 

petitioner  crosses the  equitable  hurdle  of  laches. 

As  noted  above,  the  reasons  for  delay  have  no 

justification  or  basis.  Reliance  is  placed  on  the 

case  titled  Civil  Aviation  Authority  through 

Director  General  and  3  others  v.  Mir  Zulfiqar 

Ali and another (2016 SCMR 183).

5. 

In view of above, the instant petition is not 

maintainable  due  to  laches  and  is  dismissed  in 

limine. Since the petition is being decided on the 

basis  of  maintainability,  hence  no  finding  is 

required to be rendered on merit.
