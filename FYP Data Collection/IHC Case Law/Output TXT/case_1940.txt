JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT 

W.P.No.662 of 2016  
Khurram Nasser 
VS 
The Judge Family Court (West) & others 

Date of Hearing:  29.02.2016  
Petitioner by: 
______________________________________________________ 

Sayyid Murtaza Ali Pirzada, Advocate  

MIANGUL HASSAN AURANGZEB, J:- Through the 

instant  writ  petition,  the  petitioner  (Khurram  Naseer) 

has  impugned  the  Order  dated  17.11.2015,  passed  by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  (West),  Islamabad, 

whereby  the  marriage  between  the  petitioner  and 

respondent No.2 (Uzma Khurram) was dissolved on the 

basis of khula under Section 10(4) of the West Pakistan 

Family  Courts  Act,  1964  (hereinafter  referred  to  as 

"WP-FCA,  1964").  Furthermore,  respondent  No.2  was 

directed  to  return  the  dower  amount  of  Rs.25,000/-  to 

the petitioner. As far as the rest of the claims made by 

respondent  No.2 in her  suit  for dissolution  of marriage 

on  the  basis  of  cruelty  and  assault,  recovery  of 

maintenance  and  dower  amount,  and  the  claims  made 

by  the petitioner in  his  written  statement,  they  were  to 

be decided after the recording of evidence.  

2. 

The  record  shows 

that 

the  petitioner  and 

respondent No.2 got married on 18.03.2001. During the 

wedlock, four children were born, namely, Abdul Nafeh 

(aged  13),  Ummama  (aged  10),  Ramla  (aged  08)  and 

Hamna (aged 06).  These children are in the custody of 

respondent  No.2.  On  03.10.2014, 

the  petitioner 

contracted  a  second  marriage.  The  strained  relations 

between  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.1  caused 

her  to  leave  her  matrimonial  abode  along  with  her 

children. On 08.04.2015, respondent No.2 instituted the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
2 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

suit for dissolution of marriage etc., before the Court of 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  (West),  Islamabad.  This 

suit was contested by the petitioner by filing a detailed 

written  statement  wherein  the  petitioner  prayed  that  a 

decree for  the dissolution  of marriage  may  be granted 

to respondent No.2 "subject to the payment of advance 

taken at Rs.10,00,000/- or any other sum, collected 

from  Mr.  Chaudhry  Sagheer,  in  connection  with 

Agreement to Sell dated 23.12.2014, entered in to 

unlawfully by committing criminal breach of trust being 

a Muslim wife." Additionally, it was prayed that the suit 

for  the  dissolution  of  the  marriage  on  the  basis  of 

cruelty,  physical  assault  and  non-payment  of 

maintenance, be rejected. 

3.  A  copy  of  the  order  sheet  of  the  learned  Trial 

Court appended to this petition reveals that  vide order 

dated  07.10.2015,  the  learned  Trial  Court  adjourned 

the  matter  for  pre-trial  reconciliation  proceedings 

between  the  parties  to  20.10.2015.  As  the  learned 

Presiding  Officer  was  on  leave  on  20.10.2015,  the 

matter  was  adjourned  to  05.11.2015.  On  05.11.2015, 

both  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  were  present 

before  the  learned  Trial  Court,  and  they  were  given 

time  in  the  Court  to  reconcile  their  differences,  but  to 

no  avail.  During  these  proceedings,  respondent  No.2 

asked for the dissolution of the marriage on the basis of 

khula  and  expressed  her  readiness  to  forego  her  right 

to  the  dower  amount.  The  learned  Trial  Court  duly 

recorded the statements of the contesting parties.  

4. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner,  in  the 

proceedings  before  the  learned  Trial  Court,  had  taken 

the position that the marriage could not be dissolved as 

the  matter  involved  monetary  claims  of  the  petitioner, 

which  he  was  entitled  to  get  prior  to  the  dissolution  of 

the marriage. The learned Trial Court, vide order dated 

 
 
 
3 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

05.11.2015, fixed an amount of Rs.5,000/- per month for 

each  minor  child  as  interim  maintenance,  which  was 

payable  on  or  before  the  14th  of  each  calendar  month 

with effect from November, 2015. The matter was then 

adjourned to 17.11.2015. After hearing the parties, the 

learned  Trial  Court,  vide  order  dated  17.11.2015, 

dissolved  the  marriage  between  the  petitioner  and 

respondent  No.2  on  the  basis  of  khula  under  Section 

10(4) of the WP-FCA, 1964.  

5. 

Learned  counsel for  the  petitioner  submitted  that 

the 

learned  Trial  Court  erred  by  dissolving  the 

marriage  between  the  contesting  parties  as  it  was 

obligatory  upon  the  learned  Trial  Court  to  wait  until 

evidence  was  led  establishing  cruelty  at  the  hands  of 

the  petitioner  and  until 

the  amount  due 

from 

respondent  No.2  was  recovered  by  the  petitioner.  He 

further  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial  Court  had 

violated  the  procedure prescribed  in  Section  10  of  the 

WP-FCA,  1964,  by  not  affording  a  meaningful 

opportunity  to  the  contesting  parties  to  reconcile  their 

differences.  He  also  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial 

Court  could  not  dissolve  the  marriage  on  the  basis  of 

khula  when  the suit  instituted  by  respondent No.2 was 

for  the  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the  basis  of  cruelty 

etc.  He  also  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial  Court 

erred  by  dissolving  the  marriage  at  the  stage  of  pre-

trial  reconciliation  proceedings  without  requiring 

respondent  No.2  to  either  amend  the  existing  plaint  or 

to file a fresh plaint seeking the dissolution of marriage 

on  the  basis  of  khula.  In  making  his  submissions,  the 

learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the cases of 

Fakkhar  ud  Din  VS  Kousar  Taqreem  reported  as  PLD 

2009  Peshawar  92,  Muhammad  Faisal  Khan  VS  Sadia 

reported  as  PLD  2013  Peshawar  12,  Sajid  Abbas  Rizvi 

VS  Noureen  reported  as  PLD  2013  Sindh  348,

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

Muhammad  Ashraf  Butt  VS  Muhammad  Asif  Bhatti 

reported as PLD 2011 SC 905, and  Muhammad Anwar 

VS Illyas Begum reported as PLD 2013 SC 255. 

6. 

I have heard  the arguments advanced by learned 

counsel for the petitioner and perused the record with 

his able assistance.  

7. 

I cannot bring myself to agree with the contention 

made  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  that  in 

dissolving  the  marriage  on  the  basis  of  khula,  the 

learned  Trial  Court  violated  the  mandatory  provisions 

of  Section  10  of 

the  WP-FCA,  1964,  which 

is 

reproduced herein below:-   

"10.  Pre-trial  proceeding.  --  (1)  [When  the 
written  statement  is  filed,  the  Court  shall  fix  an 
early date for a pre-trial hearing of the case.]  

(2)  On  the  date  so  fixed,  the  Court  shall 
examine  the  plaint,  the  written  statement  (if  any) 
and  the  precise  of  evidence  and  documents  filed 
by the parties and shall also, if it so deems fit, hear 
the parties, and their counsel.  

(3) 

At  the  pre-trial,  the  Court  shall  ascertain 
the  points  at 
issue  between  the  parties  and 
attempt  to  effect  a  compromise  or  reconciliation 
between the parties, if this be possible.  

(4) 

If  no  compromise  or  reconciliation 

is 
possible  the  Court  shall  frame  the  issues  in  the 
case  and  fix  a  date  for  [the  recording  of  the] 
evidence.  

for  dissolution  of  marriage, 
fails,  shall  pass  decree 

[Provided  that  notwithstanding  any  decision  or 
judgment of any Court or tribunal, the Family Court 
in  a  suit 
if 
reconciliation 
for 
dissolution  of  marriage  forthwith  and  also  restore 
the husband the Haq Mehr  received by the wife in 
consideration  of  marriage  at 
time  of 
marriage.]"  

the 

8.  Now  the  record  reveals  that  on  05.11.2015,  the 

learned  Trial  Court,  in  accordance  with  Section  10  (3) 

of the WP-FCA, 1964, gave an adequate opportunity to 

the  contesting  parties  to  reconcile  their  differences. 

These  pre-trial  reconciliation  proceedings  could  not 

result in curing the differences between the contesting 

parties,  who  also  happened  to  be  cousins.  Therefore, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

after  recording  the  statements  of  the  contesting 

parties,  the  learned  Trial  Court  proceeded  further  and 

dissolved  the  marriage  in  accordance  with  Section 

10(4) of the WP-FCA, 1964, and the proviso thereto.  

9. 

It  is  settled  law  that  for  a  dissolution  of  marriage 

on the basis of khula the statement of the wife alone is a 

determinative  factor.  Sections  10(3)  &  (4)  of  the  WP-

FCA,  1964,  place  an  obligation  on  the  Family  Court  to 

effect  a  compromise  or  reconciliation  between  the 

parties.  It  is  only  after  the  Family  Court  considers  that 

no  compromise or reconciliation is  possible that  it can 

proceed to dissolve the marriage and pass a decree for 

the  dissolution  of  marriage.  As  mentioned  above,  the 

learned  Trial  Court  in  the  instant  case  has  satisfied 

these prerequisites. 

10. 

It  is  by  now  well  settled  that  the  proviso  to  Sub- 

Section 4 of Section 10 (requiring the wife to restore to 

the  husband  the  Haq  Mehr  received  by  her 

in 

consideration of marriage at the time of marriage) shall 

be  applicable  only  to  those  cases  in  which  a  Family 

Court  grants  a  decree  on  the  ground  of  khula.  The 

learned  Trial  Court  was  correct  in  dissolving  the 

marriage  between  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2 

on the basis of khula because respondent No.2, had on 

05.11.2015  claimed  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the 

basis  of  khula  and  had  expressed  her  readiness  to 

forego  her  right  to  the  dower  amount.  Consequently, 

vide the impugned order dated 17.11.2015, the learned 

Judge  Family  Court  not  just  dissolved  the  marriage  on 

the basis of khula, but also directed respondent No.2 to 

return 

the  dower  amount  of  Rs.25,000/- 

to 

the 

petitioner. 

11.  The  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  that  learned  Trial  Court  could  not  have 

dissolved  the  marriage  on  the  basis  of  khula  without 

 
 
 
 
6 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

requiring  respondent  No.2  either  to  amend  her  suit  or 

file  a  fresh  one,  is  hyper  technical  in  nature  and  goes 

against 

the  essential  requirement  of  expeditious 

disposal of such cases. True, respondent No.2 had filed 

a suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of cruelty, 

etc.,  but  the  record  reveals  that  on  05.11.2015  she 

asked for the dissolution of the marriage on the basis of 

khula and expressed her readiness to forgo her right to 

the  dower  amount.  This  is  duly  recorded  in  the  order 

dated  05.11.2015,  passed  by  the  learned  Trial  Court. 

Hence, it was not incumbent for the learned Trial Court 

to  establish  cruelty  or  non-payment  of  maintenance 

before dissolving a marriage on the basis of khula. 

12.  The  case  law  relied  upon  by  the  learned  counsel 

for the petitioner does not come to his aid.  There is no 

cavil  with  the  law  laid  down  in  the  case  of  Muhammad 

Anwar  VS  Illyas  Begum  reported  as  PLD  2013  SC  255 

that 

individuals  have  a  right 

to  be 

treated 

in 

accordance  with  the  law.  The  case  of  Muhammad 

Ashraf Butt VS Muhammad Asif Bhatti reported as PLD 

2011  SC  905  relates  to  the  doctrine  of lis pendens  as 

enshrined in Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, 

1882.  In  this  case,  it  was  held  that if a revisional court 

passes  an  order  which  does  not  qualify  the  test  of 

Article  4  of  the  Constitution  and  suffers  from  a  patent 

error  such  as  non-reading  and  misreading  of  the  facts 

on  the record,  it  can  be corrected  and  rectified  by  the 

High  Court  in  exercise  of  its  constitutional  jurisdiction 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution.  In  the  case  of 

Fakkhar  ud  Din  VS  Kousar  Taqreem  reported  as  PLD 

2009  Peshawar  92,  the  Hon'ble  Peshawar  High  Court 

dilated  upon  the  amendments  made  in  inter alia  the 

West  Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  through  the 

Family  Courts 

(Amendment)  Ordinance,  2002. 

In 

paragraph  30  of  the  said  Judgment,  guidelines  have 

 
 
7 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

been provided by the Hon'ble High Court, which can be 

taken  into  consideration  by  the  Family  Courts  while 

deciding  a  petition  for  dissolution  of  marriage  on  the 

ground of khula. Some of these guidelines come to the 

aid  of  respondent  No.2,  viz  the  husband  having 

contracted  a  second  marriage.    In  the  cases  of  Sajid 

Abbas  Rizvi  VS  Noureen  reported  as  PLD  2013  Sindh 

348 and Muhammad Faisal Khan VS Sadia reported as 

PLD  2013  Peshawar  12,  Section  10  of  the  WP-FCA, 

1964, has been interpreted and emphasis has been laid 

on 

the 

requirement 

to  conduct 

the  pre-trial 

reconciliation  process.  As  mentioned  above,  the  case 

law  relied  upon  by  the 

learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  does  not  come  to  his  aid.  The  learned  Trial 

Court  has  strictly  adhered  to  the  procedure  set  out  in 

Section 10 of the WP-FCA, 1964, by conducting pre-trial 

reconciliation proceedings after the petitioner filed the 

written  statement  and  before 

the  marriage  was 

dissolved on the basis of khula.  

13.  The  powers  that  this  Court  is  to  exercise  in  its 

constitutional  jurisdiction  enshrined  in  Article  199  of 

the Constitution in a challenge to an order passed by a 

Family  Court  dissolving  a  marriage  on  the  ground  of 

khula  have  been  elaborately  set  out  by  the  Division 

Bench of the Hon'ble Peshawar High Court in the case 

of Hadyat Ullah VS Amna Bibi reported as 2005 CLC 54 

Peshawar, in the following terms:- 

"Powers  of  High  Court  in  constitutional  jurisdiction 
are  not  analogous  to  those  of  an  Appellate  Court. 
Constitutional  jurisdiction  can  only  be  exercised,  if 
the lower Court has exceeded its jurisdiction or acted 
without  jurisdiction.  Finding  of  fact  recorded  by  a 
Court  possessing  jurisdiction  cannot  be  disturbed 
merely on the ground that another view is possible on 
the same evidence, unless that finding is based on no 
evidence, is fanciful or arbitrary. The object of taking 
away  right  of  appeal 
is 
meaningful. If the constitutional jurisdiction takes the 
place  of  appeal,  then  the  intent  and  purpose  of 

in  the  family  matters 

 
 
 
 
8 

W.P.No.622 of 2016  

Legislature would be frustrated. Impugned judgment, 
if passed with competence and jurisdiction conferred 
on  the  Court  of  law,  then  it  cannot  be  adjudged  in 
Constitutional jurisdiction of High Court."  

14. 

In  view  of  the  above,  I  find  the  order  dated 

17.11.2015  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court 

to  be  strictly  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  not 

suffering  from  any  jurisdictional  infirmity.  The  instant 

writ  petition  having  been  bereft  of  substance 

is 

dismissed in limine.
