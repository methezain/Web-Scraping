Chaudhry Imran Ali 

VS 

Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  etc. 

Petitioner by: 

Mr. Muhammad Ashfaq Shahid, 
Advocate. 

Respondents 3  to 6 by: 

Sardar Taimoor Aslam, Advocate. 

Date  of Decision: 

20.02.2020. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI.  J:- Through  this  writ petition,  the petitioner 

has assailed the  order  dated 28.12.2017, passed by learned Additional  District Judge-IX 

(West), Islamabad, whereby appeal filed by the petitioner has been dismissed against the 

order  dated  26.10.2017,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court  (West)  Islamabad, 

whereby application for setting aside ex-parte judgment  & decree was dismissed. 

2.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contends that the petitioner filed an application for 

setting  aside  ex-parte  judgment  &  decree  dated  21.02.2015,  passed  by  learned  Judge 

Family Court mainly on the ground that the petitioner has not been served as he was out 

of country and  respondents  No.3 to 4 obtained ex-parte judgment  and  decree  in suit for 

dissolution of marriage  on the basis of cruelty, recovery of gold ornaments, dower, gifts 

and maintenance;  that  respondent  No.3  after  obtaining  ex-parte judgment  and decree  in 

her  favour  herself  stated  in  Crl.  Misc.  No.2450-H/2015  and  acknowledged  that  the 

petitioner was out of country in Kuwait referred in Para-6 of the petition and on the basis 

of her Crl. Misc.  Petition, Lahore High Court handed over custody of one of the minors 

in  terms  of  section  491,  Cr.P.C  vide  order  dated  30.11.2015  and  as  such  judicial 

proceedings  confirms  stance  of the petitioner,  which  was  not  appreciated  by the  Courts 

below; that the petitioner  has paid entire due maintenance to respondents  and two of the 

minors  are  still  living  with  the  petitioner  but  these  facts  have  not  been  appreciated  in 

proper manner. 

3. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for respondents No.3  to  6  contends that  respondent 

No.3 married to the petitioner and she filed suit for dissolution of marriage on the basis of 

W.P.  No.505/2018.

cruelty,  recovery  of  gold  ornaments,  dower,  gifts  and  maintenance  on  31.05.2014, 

whereby the said suit was contested by the petitioner, who filed his written statement and 

thereafter the matter was decided in his presence to the extent of dissolution of marriage 

as well as maintenance  due to non-payment of interim maintenance and as such ex-parte 

judgment  & decree  was not passed  at the back of the petitioner,  who was fully aware of 

each and every date of the proceedings. 

4. 

5. 

I have heard the arguments and perused the record. 

Perusal of the record reveals that the petitioner is mainly aggrieved with the order 

dated  26.10.2017,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad,  whereby  his 

application for setting aside ex-parte judgment  &  decree dated 26.02.2015 was dismissed. 

As  per  record  the  petitioner  and  respondent  No.3  married  to  each  other  on  08.04.2000 

and three children were borne froni the said wedlock, however, respondent No.3 filed suit 

for dissolution  of marriage  on the  basis  of cruelty,  recovery  of gold  ornaments,  dower, 

gifts and maintenance  on 31.05.2014. The suit was contested by the petitioner by way of 

filing written statement on 02.10.2014. Learned Judge Family Court passed the order for 

interim maintenance in terms of section  17-A of Family Court Act,  1964 vide order dated 

22.09.2014  at  the  rate  of  Rs.30,000/-  per  month  for  each  minor.  The  petitioner 

approached  this  Court  against  the  order  of interim  maintenance,  which  was reduced  to 

Rs. I 0.,000/- per  month  per  child but  despite that  the  petitioner  failed to  deposit  the  said 

maintenance,  therefore,  his  right  was  struck  off  vide  order  dated  24.02.2015.  The 

petitioner  remained  on  watching  brief  and  intentionally  avoided  Trial  Court  and  as  a 

result  whereof  Trial  Court  proceeded  against  ex-parte  against  the  petitioner  on 

21.05.2015 and finally ex-parte judgment  & decree was passed to the extent of remaining 

claims of respondent No.3 on 20.06.2015. 

6. 

Keeping in view above background, I have also gone through the application filed 

by  the  petitioner  on  02.06.2017  for  setting  aside  ex-parte  judgment  &  decree,  which 

reveals following ground:- 

"that the applicant has no knowledge of the captioned judgment 
and  decree due  to the fact  that the  applicant was abroad and 
summons were not served upon him." 

W.P. No.505/2018.

7. 

The  above  mentioned  ground has  been  denied  by  the  respondents  side, who 

contested  the  application  and  as  such the  ground taken  by  the  petitioner  is  contrary to 

record,  who  was  fully  aware  of the  proceedings  of  the  learned  Family  Court,  even  the 

decree  for  dissolution  of marriage  on the  basis  of Khula  was passed  in his presence  on 

24.01.2015 when  his  clerk  counsel was present.  The entire record  speaks volume  about 

the  conduct  of  the  petitioner,  who  has  not  paid  a  single  penny  in  previous  orders  as 

maintenance  of the respondents  rather frustrated the decree although at this  stage he has 

deposited  certain  amount  and  also  contends that  two  of the  minors  are  still  living with 

him. 

8. 

Keeping  in  view  above  background,  the  plea  raised  by  the  petitioner  in  the 

application is misconceived  and is contrary to record,  as a result  whereof learned Judge 

Family  Court  as  well  as  Appellate  Court have  rightly  appreciated  the  entire record  and 

dismissed  the  claim  of  the  petitioner  without  any  legal  and  jurisdictional  defect.  The 

entire  record  reflects  the  contemptuous  conduct  of  the  petitioner,  who  has  not  even 

satisfied  the  decree  at  first  instance  nor  complied  with  the  orders  passed  by  learned 

Family Court in terms of section  17-A of Family Court Act,  1964, his defense was struck 

off and has been  proceeded  against  ex-parte, when  he was on  watching brief, therefore, 

his plea for non-service is not justified. 

9. 

In view  of  above  discussion,  the  instant  writ  petition  bears  no  merits,  therefore, 

the same is hereby dismissed.
