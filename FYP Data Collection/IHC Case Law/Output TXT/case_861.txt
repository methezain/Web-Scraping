co-accused  has  shared  her  objectionable  /  nude 

and  naked  pictures  /  videos  to  her  husband  and 

other  relatives. 

10. 

As  far  as  the  argument  regarding  the  grant 

of  bail  in  the  cases  not falling  under the  prohibitory 

clause is  concerned. It  is  clarified,  that  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court of  Pakistan has  held in  a  case  titled 

as  "Shameel  Ahmed  VS  The State"  (2009 

SCMR 174), that: 

"with  regard to  the  contention that 

the bail should always be granted in 

cases not  falling  within  the  domain 

of  prohibition  clause of  proviso  to 

section 497,  Cr.P.C it  is  observed 

that  it  is  not  a  rule  of  universal 

application. Each case has to  been 

seen  through  its  own  facts  and 

ctrcumstsnces"; 

The  same  principle  has  been  laid  down  in  a  case 

titled  as 

''Afzaal Ahmed  VS  The State'~  2003 

6 

Cr/.  Misc. 1280-B 0(2021 

SCMR 573which  states that: 

"The mere fact  that  an offence did 

not fall  within  the prohibitory  clause 

of  section 497(1)  of  the  Cr.P.C did 

not  mean that  such an offence had 

become  a  bailable  offence.  The 

discretion still  remained  with  the 

competent  Court 

to 

consider 

whether a person accused of such an 

offence did  or  did  not  deserve the 

grant  of  bail  in  accordance with 

established norms  governing  the 

exercise of such a power. 

It  has  also  been  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled  as 

''Muhammad 

Siddique  VS 

Imtiaz  Begum  and  others'~ 

2002 SCMR 442that: 

"none can claim bail  as of  right  in 

non-bailable offences even though 

the  same  do  not  fall  under  the 

prohibitory  clause 497 Cr.P.C'. 

On  the  same  subject  the  guidance  has  also  been 

taken  from  the  law  laid  down  in  a  case  titled  as 

"Haji  Muhammad  Nazir  and  others  VS  The 

State'~  2008  SCMR 807  wherein,  it  has  been 

held  that: 

"It  is  true  that  offences for  which 

petitioners  have  been  charged 

entails  punishment  not  more than 

five years, which also falls within the 

category  of  non-bailable  offence, 

therefore, they are not  entitled  as a 

7 

Cr/.  Misc. 1280-B 0(2021 

matter  of  right  for  release on bail, 

notwithstanding  the  fact  that  their 

case  is  covered  under  the  non  

prohibitory  clause as defined under 

section 497, Cr.P.C as it  has been 

held  in 

the  case  of  Muhammad 

Siddique (ibid). As far as principle of 

law being relied upon by the learned 

counsel from  the  judgment  in  the 

case of  Tariq Bashir (ibid)  that  the 

grant  of  bail  in  offence punishable 

with  imprisonment for  less than ten 

years  is  a  rule  and  refusal  is 

exception would  not  help  to  the 

petitioners  in  view  of  exceptional 

and  extraordinary  circumstances of 

the case'. 

In  different  cases  under 

the  Prevention  of 

Electronic Crimes Act,  2016 where the  offences not 

falling  under  prohibitory  clause  of  section  497 

Cr.P.C,  the  bail  after  arrest  has  been  rejected  by 

this  Court vide judgment  reported  as  2020  PCr.LJ 

1652 as  well as  by the  Hon'ble Lahore High Court, 

Lahore vide  cases reported  as  2018  PCr.LJ 408 

and  2018  PCr.LJ 1667  and  the  Hon'ble  Sindh 

High Court vide case reported as 2018  YLR 329. 

11.  Offence  committed  by 

the  petitioner 

/ 

accused is  a  heinous crime which  is  harmful for  the 

society as  the  child  pornographic  videos  have also 

been  retrieved  from  the  mobile  phone  of  the 

petitioner  and  was  also  found  sharing  the  same. 

8 

Cr/.  Misc. 1280-B 0(2021 

The  impact  of  child  pornography  on  the  society  is 

remarkable and enforces the  normalization of  child 

exploitation  by  way  of  providing  them  safety  and 

protection  and  by awarding severe punishments to 

the accused. 

12. 

As  the  sufficient  evidence is  available against 

the  petitioner 

/  accused;  challan  has  been 

submitted  in  the  learned  trial  Court.  It  has  also 

been  laid  down  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme Court  of 

Pakistan  in  a  case  titled  as  "Rehmat Ullah  VS 

State"  (2011  SCMR  1332),  that 

the  Courts 

should not  grant  or  cancel  bail  when  the  trial  is  in 

progress. 

13.  Considering 

the 

above 

facts 

and 

circumstances,  I  am  clear  in  my  mind  that  the 

petitioner  has  failed  to  make out  his  case  for  grant 

of  bail  on 

the  ground  of 

further 

inquiry  as 

envisaged 

under 

section 

497(2) 

Cr.P.C, 

consequently, 

the 

instant  bail  petition  stands 

dismissed. 

14. 

Needless  to  mention  that,  this  is  a  tentative 

assessment which  shall  not  affect  the  trial  of  case 

in  any manner.
