LUBNA SALEEM  PERVEZ,  J. 

Through  this  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

invoked  the  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan seeking following prayer.- 

it 

"In  view  of  the  above  mentioned  circumstances, 
is  therefore, 
respectfully prayed  that  the  instant  writ petition  may  kindly  be  allowed 
and  the  impugned  order  dated  04.12.2019 passed  by  Mr.  Nasir  Javed 
Rana, Learned Additional District Judge, Islamabad-West may very kindly 
be set  aside and the appeal of the petitioner  may very kindly be allowed I 
decreed as per prayer  by declaring  the order dated 29.07.2019 passed  by 
the  Court  of Miss  Ayesha  Shabbir,  Learned  Guardian Judge,  Islamabad 
and  order  dated  21.11.2019  passed  by  the  Court  of Miss  Saira  !rum, 
Learned  Guardian Judge,  Islamabad  as  illegal,  unlawful,  void  ab-initio, 
ineffective and inoperative, against the rights of the petitioners,  in the best 
interest of justice.  ". 

2. 

Brief facts of the case are that the marriage between parties were solemnized 

on  11.11.2007, and from the wedlock two children namely Fatima Arif (now aged 

11)  and Muhammad  Saadain (now aged 05), were born. Due to domestic disputes 

and  bitter  relation  the  parties  initially  got  separated  and  then  Respondent  No.2 

pronounced divorce to the Petitioner No.  1  on 28.01.2016. The Respondent No. 2 

filed  petition  u/s  25  of  the  Act,  1890,  for  custody  of  minors,  wherein  with  the 

consent of the parties  it was decided that the  custody of minors  be  retained  with 

Petitioner  No.  1  and  Respondent  No.  2  was  allowed visitation  right/meeting  the 

minors as per  schedule given by the  Court. The petition  u/s 25  was thus disposed 

of with consent on 27.05.2019. The Petitioner No.  1,  when violated the Court order 

dated 27.05.2019, the learned Guardian Judge, after allowing several opportunities 

.sind  issuing  show  cause  notice,  handed  over  minors'  permanent  custody  to 

12 

respondent  No.2,  vide  order  dated  29.07.2019.  This  order  was  challenged  by 

Petitioner  No.1  in  appeal  before  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West  

Islamabad, who vide order dated 04.12.2019, dismissed the appeal holding it to be 

hopelessly time barred. Hence present petition. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the  learned  Additional 

District Judge, West-Islamabad,  has not  considered the  merits of the  case and has 

summarily  disposed  of the  appeal  solely  on  the  point  of  limitation;  that  in  the 

present case the  future of two  minor children is involved who  do not want to live 

with their Father/Respondent No. 2;  that the  second wife  of Respondent No. 2  ill  

treats  the  minors;  that  Respondent  No.  2  has  stopped  the  maintenance  of  the 

minors;  that  the  learned  Guardian  Judge  as  well  as  learned  Additional  District 

Judge have  ignored the  order  dated 27.07.2019, passed  in the transfer  application 

filed by the petitioner before the learned District Judge, West-Islamabad, whereby 

the order of the  same date  i.e. 27.07.2019, passed by  learned Guardian Judge was 

suspended; that the  appeal before the learned Additional District Judge was not hit 

by limitation as the  order dated 29.07.2019, was an ex-parte order and as soon  as 

the said order came into the knowledge of the petitioner the appeal was filed. The 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  setting  aside  the  orders  dated 

29.07.2019 & 04.12.2019. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.  2  vehemently  controverted  the 

arguments  made  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner  and  submitted  that  father  of  the 

minors/Respondent  No.2  has  every  right  to  meet  his  children,  whereas,  the 

petitioner is trying her level best to restrain him from meeting the children by filing 

frivolous  applications;  that  the  petitioner  has  not  come  to  the  Court  with  clean 

hands; that the petitioner  has deliberately concealed the  facts from the  Court; that 

for violation of order of the learned Guardian Judge by removing the children from 

the jurisdiction  of Court,  the  cost  of Rs.  10,000/- has  also  been  imposed  on  her; 

that due to contemptuous behavior before the Court, deliberate violations of court's 

order and not bringing the minor children as per  meeting schedule, the permanent 

custody of the minors children has been handed over to Respondent No. 2; that it is 

not correct that the children were ill-treated at their father's  house; that even today 

the  children  are  residing  with  the  Petitioner  No.  1;  that  Petitioner  No.  1  has 

misstated  regarding  stoppage  of maintenance  as  Respondent  No.  2  is  regularly 

.depositing the  maintenance  before  the  Court;  that  the  appeal  against  order  dated 

13 

29.07.2019, is  badly time barred as copy of the order was applied on 01.08.2019, 

which  was  prepared  and  received  on  the  same  date  and  the  appeal  was  filed  on 

23.11.2019; that the time for filing appeal is 30 days; that even if the argument of 

the  petitioner  regarding  knowledge  of  the  order  on  12.10.2019 is  believed  to  be 

true even then the  appeal is barred by more than 40 days; he, therefore,  submitted 

that  the  impugned  order  dated  04.12.2019,  is  in  accordance  with  law  and prayed 

for dismissal of the instant petition. 

5. 

Heard  learned  counsel  for the  parties  at  length  and  perused  the  documents 

appended with the case file and subsequently filed through various C.Ms. 

6. 

Though the Petitioner No.  1  in the present petition has challenged the orders 

dated  29.07.2019  &  21.11.2019  of  the  learned  Guardian  Judge  as  well  as  order 

dated  04.12.2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West  

Islamabad,  on  merits  of  the  case,  and  prayed  for  setting  aside  of  the  same, 

however,  the  issue  of  limitation  is  also  involved  as  in  the  last  order  dated 

04.12.2019, merits  of  the  case  have  not  been  discussed  and  the  appeal  has  been 

dismissed only on  the  point  of  limitation. Hence,  before  going  into the  details of 

the  controversy  between  the  parties  it  is  to  be  seen  that  the  appeal  against  the 

impugned  order  has  been  filed  by  the  petitioner  within  the  period  of  30  days  as 

prescribed under the law or not. 

7. 

Learned  counsel  for Respondent  No.  2  referred  to  the  attestation  stamp on 

the order dated 29.07.2019, according to which copy of the order was obtained on 

01.08.2019  and  from  that  date,  the  period  for  filing  of  appeal  expired  on 

30.08.2019. Perusal of the order dated 29.07.2019 showed that no one on behalf of 

the petitioner  was  in attendance  despite having knowledge  of the  fixation of case 

on the  said date,  therefore,  the  argument of the  learned  counsel  for the petitioner 

that  on  12.10.2019, she  was  informed  about  the  passing  of  the  said  order  where 

after she challenged the  same through filing of appeal. This argument on behalf of 

the  Petitioner No.  1  is  not  convincing that  she was  not  aware  of the  order  dated 

29.07.2019,  as  record  reveals  that  she  was  constantly  filing  applications  before 

various  courts  seeking  different  orders,  in violation  of the  consented  order  dated 

27.05.2019,  passed  by  the  learned  Guardian  Judge  regarding  visitation  right  of 

Respondent No.2.  Perusal  of the  order  sheets  further reveals  that  on  27.07.2019, 

court proceedings  were  duly  attended  by the  learned  counsel  for Petitioner No.  1 

when  she  was  issued  show  cause  notice  for  removmg 

the  mmors  from  the 

jurisdiction  of  the  Court  and  notice  for  proceedings  u/s  39  of  the  Act,  1890,  for 

filing  reply  on  29.07.2019.  Perusal  of the  said  order  revealed  that  the  learned  Judge 

has  kept  the  case  till  the  last  hours  of the  Court  and  consequently  on  failure  of the 

petitioner  to  submit  reply  of the  show  cause  notice,  and  dye  to  intentional  absence 

from  the  proceedings, 

the  learned  Judge  has  passed  the  order  of  removing  the 

guardianship  of  the  minor  children  from  Petitioner  No.  1  and  handed  over  the 

custody 

to  Respondent  No.  2.  Thus, 

I  am  convinced 

that  Petitioner  No.I 

deliberately  avoided  her  attendance  during  Court  proceedings  before  the  learned 

Guardian  Judge  on  29.07.2019  and  her  argument  of  having  no  knowledge  about 

order  dated  29.07.2019,  till  12.10.2019,  is not  persuasive. 

8. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  I  am  of  the  considered  view  that  the 

impugned  order  dated  04.12.2019,  passed  by the  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

West-Islamabad, 

is  legally  correct  as  it has now been established principle  of law 

that  issue  of  limitation  when  raised  is  to  be  decided  first  before  taking  into 

consideration the  dispute and other merits of the  case rather the Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court of Pakistan has further held in its judgment passed in case re: Commissioner 

of  Income-Tax,  Companies  Zone-IV,  Karachi  VS Hakim  Ali  Zardari 

(2006  SCMR  170)  that  "Matter  of limitation  would  not  be  left  to pleadings  of 

parties  but  a  duty  was  imposed  on  the  Court  itself  to  decide  whether  the 

proceedings  had been flied  within the period  of limitation". 

9. 

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  impugned  order  dated  04.12.2019  is  held  to  be 

just  and legal which does not call for any interference. Resultantly, present petition 

stands dismissed accordingly.
