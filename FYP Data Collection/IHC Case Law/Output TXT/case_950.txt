Proceedings 
06.12.2021  Malik  Shahid  Mehmood  Kandwal,  Advocate  for 

the petitioner.  
Mr.  Zahid  Ayub  Rathore,  Advocate  for  the 
respondent.  

The  petitioner  has  impugned  the  order 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Court 

dated  14.09.2021,  pursuant  to  which  the  appeal 

filed  by  the  petitioner  was  dismissed  on  the 

ground of limitation.  

2.  

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contended  that  this  Court  had  issued  Notification 

No.  F.(01)/Genl/IHC/9770  dated  30.09.2021, 

pursuant  to  which  it  was  clarified  that  limitation 

period  for  purposes  of  Section  12  of  Limitation 

Act,  1908  (”Act”)  would  not  apply 

from 

24.03.2020  to  30.09.2021  for  purposes  of  filing 

any  suit,  petition  and  appeal  etc.,  in  view  of  the 

emergency  situation  that  had  emerged  due  to 

Covid-19.  He  further  submitted  that  the  appeal

ought  to  have  been  heard  and  decided  on  its 

merits, which was not done.  

3. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

respondent 

submitted  that  there  was  no  infirmity  in  the 

impugned  judgment  dated  14.09.2021,  whereby 

the 

learned  Additional  District 

Judge  had 

dismissed 

the  appeal 

for  being  barred  by 

limitation.  

4. 

In  view  of  the  emergency  situation  that 

had  arisen  amid  Covid-19  pandemic,  this  Court 

had  issued  notification  dated  30.09.2021.  It 

appears  that  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties 

were  unable  to  draw  the  attention  of  the  learned 

Additional  District  Judge  to  the  aforementioned 

notification  and consequently  the said notification 

had  not  been  discussed  in  the  impugned  order. 

The  notification  dated  30.09.2021  states  the 

following:  

        “Whereas,  due  to  pandemic  Corona-

virus  (COVID-19)  coupled  with  lock-down 

policy  of  the  Federal  government,  this 

court  vide  Office  Order  No.  181/IHC/2020  

dated  24.03.2020,  was  pleased  to  direct 

that  owing  to  the  prevailing  emergency 

situation  in  the  country,  the  period  of 

limitation  prescribed  by  laws  in  filing 

appeals/petitions  etc  in  this  court  as  well 

as 

in 

the  Civil  and  District  Courts, 

Islamabad,  till  the  time  the  situation 

returns to normalcy, shall be deemed to be 

condoned  and 

the  courts  shall  be 

 
 - 3-                        W.P No.3443/2021. 

presumed to be closed during the period in 

the  public  interest,  within  the  meaning 

Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1908.   

2. 

Now  the  Federal  Government  has 

lifted  certain  restrictions  earlier  imposed 

by it, therefore, keeping in view the policy 

of  the  Government,  the  Hon’ble  Authority 

has  been  pleased  to  direct  that  the  above 

said Office Order shall cease to have effect 

from  30.09.2021  and  the  period  from 

24.03.2020 

to  30.09.2021 

shall  be 

excluded for the purpose of computing the 

limitation  in  terms  of  Section  12  of  the 

Limitation  Act  1908,  for  filing  any  suit, 

petition and appeal, etc.  

5. 

The object of issuing the notification was to 

take  cognizance  of  the  hardship  that  litigating 

parties were facing in seeking access to justice. 

6. 

Given  that  this  aspect  of  the  matter  has 

not  been  addressed  in  the  impugned  order,  the 

instant  petition  is  allowed  and  consequently  the 

impugned  order  is  set-aside.  The  appeal  of  the 

appellant  shall  be  deemed  pending  before  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge.  The  parties  are 

directed  to  appear  before  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge  on  11.01.2022  to  enable  the 

learned court to adjudicate the appeal.  

Saeed.
