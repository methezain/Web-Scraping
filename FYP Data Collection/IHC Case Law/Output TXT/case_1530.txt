Jahanzeb Shah 

VS

The Additional  District Judge (West), Islamabad,  etc. 

Petitioner: 

In Person. 

Respondents  by: 

Mr.  Mushtaq  Hussain,  Advocate  along  with 
Respondent  No.3 

Date of Decision: 

01.10.2020. 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KA YANI,  I:  Through  this  Writ  Petition,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed  the  order  dated  11.04.2019, passed  by learned  Additional 

District Judge (West), Islamabad, whereby  appeal  filed by respondent  No.3/Mst. 

Saba was allowed  and  custody  of two minors  namely  Muhammad  Waleed Shah 

alias  Abdul  Samad  (Respondent  No.4)  and  Muhammad  Adeen  Shah  alias 

Muhammad  Musa  (Respondent  No.5)  has  been  handed  over  to  respondent 

No.3/mother. 

2. 

Petitioner  in  person  states  that  Muhammad  Waleed  Shah  alias  Abdul 

Samad born on 28.01.2007, aged about 13-1/2 years and Muhammad  Adeen Shah 

alias Muhammad  Musa,  born  on 27.04.2011, aged  about  9-1/2  years  are  his real 

sons who were born during  subsistence of marriage  with respondent  No.3/Saba; 

that  respondent  No.3  got  khulla  which  was  decreed  on  11.12.2012 and  she 

secretly  contracted  second  marriage,  which  has  also  been  dissolved  by  way  of 

khulla  and  now  she  intends  to  contract  third  marriage  with  another  person 

namely  Muhammad  Azam  and  due  to  conduct  of  respondent  No.3/mother, 

minors  could  not  be looked  after  in a proper  manner;  that  he  is highly  qualified 

W.P.  No.1814/2019 

2 

being  PhD and  working  as Scientist with  Atomic Energy  Commission  and  even 

not  entered  into  second  marriage  after  dissolution  of marriage  with  respondent 

No.3 for the sake of minors  but  first appellate  court  has  reversed  the findings  of 

learned  trial Court without  considering the law on the subject and as such decree 

of appellate court  is liable to set aside. 

3. 

Conversely, learned  counsel alongwith  respondent  No.3/mother  contends 

that  respondent  No.3 is working  as teacher  in  the  Islamabad  Model School and 

minors  are  studying  in  class  9th  and  4th  respectively  who  are  properly  looked 

after  by  respondent/  mother  at  her  own,  although  decree  for  maintenance  has 

been  passed  against  the  petitioner  who  has  not  paid  a  single  penny  w.e.f. 

February  2019;  that  minors  are  not  willing  to  join  their  father  in  any 

circumstances;  that  in  this  petition,  petitioner/father  has  leveled  false  and 

frivolous  allegations  and  resorted  to character  assassination,  whereas  during  the 

course  of  cross-examination  he  has  acknowledged  that  respondent/  mother  is 

living  a  pious  life and  as such  appellate  Court  has  rightly  passed  the  decree  in 

favour  of  respondent/  mother;  that  father  may  be  directed  to  deposit  monthly 

expenses  in  the  account  No.0274393831002704, (titled  Saba Sadiq),  MCB, F-10/ 4 

Markaz  Branch, Islamabad  and  if he can  achieve love  and  affection of two  sons 

for overnight  stay  or for vacations, minors  are allowed  to see their  father  for the 

purpose  of  visitation  but  this  opportunity  is  conditional  if  father  is  able  to 

demonstrate  his  love  and  affection towards  the  minors  who  are  looked  after  by 

respondent/  mother  since 2012 all alone. 

4. 

5. 

Arguments  heard,  record perused. 

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  petitioner/father 

filed  application  for 

custody  of minors  namely  Muhammad  Waleed Shah alias Abdul  Samad born  on 

28.01.2007, aged  about  13-1/2  years  and  Muhammad  Adeen  Shah  alias 

Muhammad  Musa, born  on 27.04.2011, aged about 9-1/2  years, who  are studying 

W.P.  No.1814/2019 

3 

in class 9th  and  4th  respectively  at  IMCB, Islamabad,  whereby  he  has  prayed  for 

custody  mainly  on the  ground  that respondent  No.3/mother  after getting khulla 

on 11.12.2012 entered  into  second marriage  which  was  also  dissolved  by way  of 

khulla  and  she  now  intends  to  contract  third  marriage  with  another  person 

Muhammad  Azam and  as such she is not looking after minors  properly.  Learned 

trial  Court  after  recording  of  evidence  allowed  the  custody  in  favour  of 

petitioner.  Feeling  aggrieved  with  the  said  order,  respondent/  mother  assailed 

the  same  which  was  decided  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge  (West), 

Islamabad  vide  order  &  decree  dated  11.04.2019,  whereby  judgment  &  decree 

passed  by learned  trial  Court  was set aside  and  minors  custody  was  declared  to 

be in favour of mother/  respondent. 

6. 

I  have  gone  through  the  evidence  of petitioner  who  appeared  before  the 

Guardian  Court  as  AW-1 and  submitted  his  evidence  through  Ex.A-1 in  which 

he  has  reiterated  his  stance  qua  the  conduct  of respondent  No.3, which  reveals 

that certain  instances  were  referred  which  amounts  to character  assassination  of 

respondent  No.3/mother  though  during  the  course  of cross-examination  it was 

acknowledged  by  the  petitioner  himself  that  he  has  no  proof  to  justify  that 

respondent  No.3/mother  has some relation with  third  person,  such admission  on 

his  part  clarify the  entire  position  that  petitioner  in  order  to  settle  his  personal 

vendetta  leveled  false allegations  though  he is a PhD doctor  and  Scientist in the 

Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, on the other  hand  respondent  No.3 is also 

a school teacher  who  is managing  the  affairs of minors  w.e.f. the  date  of khulla 

i.e.  11.12.2012 single  handedly. 

It  is  important  to  mention  here  that  the 

petitioner/father  is not  paying  maintenance  w.e.f February,  2019 till date,  which 

is  approximately  one  year  and  seven  months,  such  aspect  suggest  that 

petitioner/ father  is negligent  in performance  of his  duties  qua  the  minors.  Both 

the  minors  are  studying  under  the  supervision  of their  mother,  even  this  Court 

W.P.  No.1814/2019 

4 

called  the  minors  and  interviewed  on  09.01.2020 and  their  preference  has  been 

considered  who  have  volunteered  to live with  their  mother,  hence  the  preference 

of two  minors  who  are  13-1/2  &  9-1/2  years  respectively  could  not  be  brushed 

aside.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2017  MLD  1116  (Muhammad  Afzal  VS  Parveen 

Bibi). 

7. 

I  have  also  gone  through  the  judgment  rendered  by  first  appellate  Court 

who  has  thoroughly  scanned  the  evidence  and  has  rightly  appreciated 

the 

evidence  and  allowed 

the  appeal 

in  favour  of  respondent/  mother,  even 

preference  of  two  minors  have  also  been  recorded  by  the  appellate  Court, 

therefore,  at  this  stage,  petitioner  has  failed  to  justify  any  valid  reasons  for 

interference  in  the  impugned  judgment,  which  has  been  passed  in  accordance 

with  law  as  the  minors  have  developed  their  secured  environment,  law  and 

affection  with  the  real  mother/respondent  No.3,  who  is  presently  looking  after 

the  minors  from  last  eight  years  all  alone  in  comparison 

to  the  role  of  the 

petitioner,  who  has  not  paid  the  maintenance  for  about  19  months,  therefore, 

instant  writ  petition  merits  dismissal.  Be  that  as it may,  petitioner/father  is duty 

bound  to deposit  the  due  maintenance  w.e.f. February,  2019 till October,  2020 in 

the 

above  mentioned 

account 

number 

of 

respondent  No.3 

i.e. 

No.0274393831002704,  (titled  Saba  Sadiq),  MCB,  F-10/ 4  Markaz  Branch, 

Islamabad  after  its  confirmation  by  the  Bank.  The  petitioner/father  has  been 

confronted  qua  his  stance  for non  deposit  of maintenance  whereby  he conceded 

that  he  is  ready 

to  deposit  said  amount 

in  the  account  of  Respondent 

No.3/ mother. 

8. 

Instant  writ petition  stands  dismissed.
