TARIQ  MEHMOOD  JAHANGIRI,  J: 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed  under 

Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic 

Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed  the  legality  and  validity  of  judgment 

and  decree  dated  22.04.2019  passed  by  the 

learned  Civil  Judge  /  Judge  Family  Court  West-

Islamabad  as  well  as  judgment  and  decree 

dated  04.11.2019  passed  by 

the 

learned 

Additional District Judge, West-Islamabad.  

02.  Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the 

respondents  Nos.  1  and  2  filed  a  suit  for

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

recovery  of  maintenance,  dowry  articles  and 

gold  ornaments  in  the  Court  of  learned  Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad  against 

the 

petitioner. The suit was contested / defended by 

the  petitioner,  issues  were  framed,  evidence  of 

parties  was  recorded  and  the  suit  filed  by  the 

respondents  No.  1  and  2  was  decreed  vide 

impugned 

judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

22.04.2019,  by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  /  Judge 

Family  Court,  West-Islamabad,  whereby  the 

respondent No. 2 (Rida Rehan) minor was found 

entitled  for  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance 

@  Rs.  15,000/-  per  month  from  June  2014  till 

October  2018,  and  was  also  found  entitled  for 

recovery  of  maintenance  allowance  @  Rs. 

30,000/- per month from November 2018 till her 

legal  entitlement.  Maintenance  allowance  from 

June  2015,  was  also  subject  to  10%  annual 

increase.  Being  aggrieved  by  the  impugned 

judgment  and  decree,  the  petitioner  filed  an 

appeal  which  was  dismissed  vide  ex-parte 

judgment  and  decree  dated  04.11.2019  passed 

by  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West-

Islamabad, hence the instant writ petition.

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

03. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  inter 

alia contends that the impugned judgments and 

decrees  suffer  from  grave  illegality  hence  not 

tenable  in  the  eyes  of  law  and  are  liable  to  be 

set aside; the impugned judgments and decrees 

are  perverse,  illegal,  unlawful  and  against  law 

and facts of the case; learned lower Courts have 

failed  to  appreciate  the  real  facts  of  the  case 

and  passed  the 

impugned 

judgments  and 

decrees  in  a  hasty  manner  and  has  prayed  for 

setting aside of concurrent findings rendered by 

both the lower Courts.  

04.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for 

the  contesting  respondents  No.  1  and  2  has 

controverted  the  arguments  raised  by  the 

learned counsel for the petitioner and has stated 

that both the impugned judgments and decrees 

have  been  passed  in  accordance  with  law;  that 

impugned 

judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

04.11.2019  passed  by  the  learned  Additional 

District  &  Sessions  Judge,  West-Islamabad  and 

judgment  and  decree  dated  22.04.2019  passed 

by  Civil  Judge  /  Judge  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad  have  been  challenged  through  the 

instant  writ  petition  filed  on  10.02.2021,  which 

 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

is  badly  hit  by  the  principle  of  latches.  He 

further contends that the maintenance has been 

awarded  to  the  minor  /  respondent  No.  2, 

strictly  in  accordance  with  law  and  as  well  as 

according  to  the  evidence  produced  by  the 

parties during the course of trial and has prayed 

for dismissal of instant writ petition.  

05.  Arguments  advanced  by  learned  Counsel 

for the parties have been heard and record has 

been perused with their able assistance. 

06. 

It  is  admitted  that  impugned  judgment 

and decree was passed by the appellate Court / 

Additional  District  Judge,  West-Islamabad  on 

04.11.2019  whereby  instant  writ  petition  has 

been  filed  on  10.02.2021  i.e.  after  the  delay  of 

more than 01 year and 3 months which is badly 

barred by time and hit by principle of latches. 

07.  As  this  Court  is  the  Court  of  equity  and 

Petitioner  for  equitable  relief  was  supposed  to 

put-forth  some  convincing  materials  which 

would  have  justified  the  filing  of  this  petition 

after  considerable  delay.  As  it  is  well  settled 

principle  of  equity  that  only  vigilant  not  the 

indolent is to get the relief from Court of equity 

or  law  respecting  his  right  which  has  been 

 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

violated or infringed. Petitioner could not satisfy 

this  Court  as  to  why  he  remained  in  deep 

slumber for such a long period for realization of 

his  legal  rights  before  this  Court  which  he 

alleges to have been violated by the respondent 

/ plaintiff. 

08. 

In  a  case  titled  as  "Ahmed and 25 

others VS Ghama and 5 others” (2005 

SCMR 119), it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court of Pakistan that: 

"There is no cavil with the proposition 

that existence of laches is sufficient 

for dismissal in limine of petition".  It 

is further held that: 

"We have absolutely no hesitation in 

our mind that the petitioners failed to 

pursue their case vigilantly, vigorously 

and woke up from the deep slumber 

after  108  days  which  cannot  be 

ignored without sufficient justification 

which is badly lacking in this case”. 

The  same  principle  is  followed  in  cases 

reported  as  "2016 SCMR 183, PLD 

2016 SC 872, 2019 SCMR 1720 and 

PLD 2016 SC 514". 

 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

09.  Further,  there  are  concurrent  findings  of 

both  the  learned  Courts  below  against  the 

petitioner.  In  case  of  concurrent  finding  of  the 

courts  below,  the  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  any  misreading  or  non-

reading of the evidence. It has been laid down 

in  case  titled  as  “Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS 

Abdul Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others” 

(2008 YLR 2309)” that: 

"when there is concurrent findings 

of Courts below, the scope of the 

constitutional 

petition 

for 

interference is very limited and it 

can  only  be  interfered  when  the 

orders  of  the  Courts  below  are 

fanciful or based on misreading or 

non-reading of the evidence".  The 

same view has also been taken in a case 

titled as “Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad 

Ali and others” (PLD 2008 Karachi 

2005). 

10. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is  only 

available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of 

law. It will also be issued for correcting errors 

 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

of  jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in  excess 

of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise  its 

jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a  tribunal 

acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction and it decides a matter in violation 

of  the  principle  of  natural  justice.  The  High 

Court  while  issuing  a  writ  of  certiorari  acts  in 

exercise  of  supervisory  and  not  appellate 

jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in  exercise  of  its 

writ jurisdiction will not review the findings of 

facts  reached  by  the  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal.  Reliance  may  be  made  to  the 

following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad Khan 

VS Muhammad Irshad (Deceased) 

through LRs, (2020 SCMR 2155)", 

it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"It is by now a settled principle 

of law that the High Courts must 

not exercise their constitutional 

jurisdiction in order to interfere 

with the discretion exercised by 

lower  courts  unless  the  same 

suffers  from  jurisdictional, 

factual or legal errors. In other 

 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

words, such interference would 

be justified in cases where the 

impugned  order  has  been 

passed without jurisdiction or is 

based  on  misreading  or  non-

reading of evidence, or is not in 

accordance  with  the  law.  If 

none of these errors is present, 

the  High  Courts  must  not 

exercise  their  constitutional 

jurisdiction to interfere with the 

findings of lower courts merely 

because it reached a different 

conclusion as to the controversy 

than the latter. In this regard, 

reference  can  be  made  to  a 

collective reading of Mst. Mobin 

Fatima  v.  Muhammad  Yamin 

(PLD 2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir  Ahmad 

(1995 SCMR 1419)."  

(ii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "President All 

Pakistan  Women  Association, 

Peshawar  Cantt  VS  Muhammad 

Akbar  Awan  and  others  (2020 

SCMR 260)",  it  is  held by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court that: 

"It is settled law that when the 

Statute  does  not  provide  the 

right of appeal against certain 

orders,  the  same  cannot  be 

challenged  by  invoking  the 

constitutional jurisdiction of the 

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

High Court in order to gain a 

similar  objective.  Where  a 

Statute has expressly barred a 

remedy which is not available to 

a  party  under  the  Statute,  it 

cannot be sought indirectly by 

resort  to  the  constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High Court. 

The  High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional jurisdiction must 

be fully cognizant and conscious 

of this Rule and strictly adhere 

to the same in the interest of 

advancing the policy of law and 

delivering expeditious justice in 

accordance with the law and the 

Constitution.  Even  otherwise, 

constitutional  jurisdiction  is 

equitable  and  discretionary  in 

nature  and  should  not  be 

exercised  to  defeat  or  bypass 

the purpose of a validly enacted 

statutory provision."  

(iii) 

In  a  case 

titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others  VS 

Muhammad Fazil and others (2019 

SCMR 919)",  it  is  held by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court that: 

"Where the Court or the Tribunal 

has 

jurisdiction  and 

it 

determines specific question of 

fact or even of law, unless patent 

legal  defect  or  material 

 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

irregularity is pointed out, such 

determination  cannot  ordinarily 

be interfered with by the High 

Court 

while 

exercising 

jurisdiction under Article 199 of 

the Constitution."  

(iv) In a case titled as "Chairman, NAB 

VS Muhammad Usman and others 

(PLD 2018 SC 28)",  it  is  held  by  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The powers of judicial review 

vested  in  High  Court  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution is 

no doubt a great weapon in the 

Judge's  hands  however,  the 

same shall not be exercised in a 

case  where  discretion  is 

exercised  by  the  subordinate 

court/Tribunal in a fair and just 

manner  without  violating  or 

disregarding statutory provision 

of  law,  likely  to  occasion  the 

failure of justice. Ordinarily such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction  shall 

not be exercised at random and 

in  routine  manner”. 

The 

following  case  law  is  reproduced 

for  the  guidance  of  the  learned 

Judges  of  the  High  Court  for 

future  course  of  action:  (i)  Brig. 

(Rtd.) 

Imtiaz 

Ahmed 

v. 

Government  of  Pakistan,  through 

Secretary, 

Interior 

Division, 

 
 
11 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

Islamabad (1994 SCMR 2142), (ii) 

Shahnaz  Begum  v.  The  Hon'ble 

Judges of the High Court of Sindh 

and  Balochistan  (PLD  1971  SC 

677),  

(iii)  Malik  Shaukat  Ali 

Dogar  v.  Ghulam  Qasim  Khan 

Khakwani (PLD 1994 SC 281)"  

(v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar Islam 

VS  Muhammad  Siddique  and  2 

others (PLD 2007 SC 45)",  it  is  held 

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The High Court in exercise of 

its constitutional jurisdiction is 

not supposed to interfere in the 

findings  on  the  controversial 

question  of  facts  based  on 

evidence even if such finding is 

erroneous.  The  scope  of  the 

judicial review of the High Court 

under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution  in  such  cases,  is 

limited  to  the  extent  of 

misreading  or  non-reading  of 

evidence  or  if  the  finding  is 

based  on  no  evidence  which 

may cause miscarriage of justice 

but it is not proper for the High 

Court to disturb the finding of 

fact  through  reappraisal  of 

evidence in writ jurisdiction or 

exercise  this  jurisdiction  as  a 

substitute  of  revision  or 

appeal”. 

 
 
12 

Writ Petition No. 550 of 2021 

11.  For what has been discussed above, 

the judgments and decrees passed by the 

learned  courts  below  are  in  accordance 

with  law  and  facts  of  the  matter  and  do 

not  require  interference  by  this  Court. 

The  writ  petition  is  dismissed  with  no 

order as to costs.
