of parties or counsel where necessary. 

Date of 
order/ 
proceeding 
25.10.2021  Mr.  Khurram  Manzoor  Ch.,  Advocate  for  the 

Petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

assailed 

order 

dated 

28.07.2021,  passed  by  learned  Judge  Family 

Court,  East-Islamabad,  whereby 

interim 

maintenance @ 3000/- per month each minor 

was fixed by the learned Family Court.  

02.  Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the 

marriage  between 

the  petitioner 

and 

respondent  No.  1  was  solemnized  according 

to Shariat-e-Mohammadi on 21.08.2005, from 

the wedlock of the parties, three children i.e. 

respondent  No.  2,  3  &  4  namely  Maryam, 

Muhammad  Ahmed  and  Muhammad  Zakkria 

were  born  on  05.12.2006,  23.09.2011  and 

16.03.2009, respectively.

03.  Thereafter,  the  relations  between  the 

parties  became  strain,  respondent  No.  1  was 

thrown  out  from  house  of  the  petitioner  and 

she  is  residing  along  with  minors  at  her 

parent’s  house.  That  respondents  No.  1  to  4 

filed suit for maintenance allowance, whereby 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  vide  order  dated 

29.03.2019  fixed  the  interim  maintenance  @ 

3000/- per month to be paid to the minors.  

04.  Lateron,  respondent  No.  1  moved  an 

application  to  clarify  order  dated  29.03.2019, 

which  was  clarified  in  a  manner  that  Rs. 

3000/-  per  month  each  minor  was  fixed  by 

Court,  which  comes  to  Rs.  9000/-  as  total 

maintenance of the three minors. 

05.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner inter 

alia  contends  that  the  monthly  salary  of  the 

petitioner is Rs. 10,000/- and he is unable to 

pay  such  an  exorbitant  maintenance  to  the 

minors;  the  maintenance  has  not  been  fixed 

according  to  the  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner, as he is Imam Masjid and has very 

limited source of income; petitioner is unable 

to pay such a huge amount to the minors and

has  prayed  for  setting  aside  the  impugned 

order dated 28.07.2021.  

06.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

07. 

It is mentioned in Section 14(3) of the 

West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 

an interim order passed by a Family 

Court.” 

08. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 

“President  All  Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020 SCMR 260)”, that: 

“It  is  settled  law  that  when  the 

Statute does not provide the right of 

appeal  against  certain  orders,  the 

same  cannot  be  challenged  by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction of the High Court in order 

to gain a similar objective. Where a 

Statute  has  expressly  barred  a 

remedy which is not available to a 

party under the Statute, it cannot be 

sought  indirectly  by  resort  to  the 

constitutional jurisdiction of the High 

Court.  The  High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction  must  be 

fully cognizant and conscious of this 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 3776/2021 

Rule and strictly adhere to the same 

in the interest of advancing the policy 

of  law  and  delivering  expeditious 

justice in accordance with the law 

and the Constitution. Even otherwise, 

constitutional jurisdiction is equitable 

and  discretionary  in  nature  and 

should not be exercised to defeat or 

bypass  the  purpose  of  a  validly 

enacted 

statutory 

provision.” 

(Emphasis supplied) 

09. 

In  another  case 

titled  as  “Chief 

Executive  MEPCO  and  others  VS 

Muhammad  Fazil  and  others  (2019 

SCMR 919)”,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 

Pakistan has held that:  

“Where the Court or the Tribunal has 

jurisdiction and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of law, unless 

patent  legal  defect  or  material 

irregularity  is  pointed  out,  such 

determination  cannot  ordinarily  be 

interfered  with  by  the  High  Court 

while  exercising  jurisdiction  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution.” 

10. 

It  has  been  held  by 

the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case  titled  as 

“Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad Usman and 

others (PLD 2018 SC 28)”, that: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 3776/2021 

“The powers of judicial review vested 

in High Court under Article 199 of the 

Constitution  is  no  doubt  a  great 

weapon  in  the  Judge’s  hands 

however,  the  same  shall  not  be 

exercised in a case where discretion 

is  exercised  by  the  subordinate 

court/Tribunal  in  a  fair  and  just 

manner  without  violating  or 

disregarding  statutory  provision  of 

law, likely to occasion the failure of 

justice. Ordinarily such extraordinary 

jurisdiction shall not be exercised at 

random and in routine manner. The 

following case law is reproduced for 

the guidance of the learned Judges 

of the High Court for future course of 

action:   

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz Ahmed 

v.  Government 

of 

Pakistan, 

through 

Secretary, 

Interior 

Division, Islamabad (1994 

SCMR 2142). 

(ii)  Shahnaz  Begum  v.  The 

Hon’ble  Judges  of  the 

High Court of Sindh and 

Balochistan (PLD 1971 SC 

677). 

(iii)  Malik Shaukat Ali Dogar v. 

GhulamQasim 

Khan 

Khakwani(PLD  1994  SC 

281).  

11.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  also  be 

 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 3776/2021 

made to the following case laws:  

(i) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan in a  case  titled 

as  “Syed  Saghir  Ahmad  Naqvi  VS 

Province of Sindh (1996 SCMR 1165), 

that: 

“The  statute  excluding  a 

right  of  appeal  from  the 

interim  order  cannot  be 

passed  by  bringing  under 

attack such interim orders in 

Constitutional  jurisdiction. 

The  party  affected  has  to 

wait  till  it  matures  into  a 

final order and then to attack 

it  in  the  proper  exclusive 

forum  created  for  the 

purpose  of  examining  such 

orders.” 

(ii) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan in  a  case  titled 

as  “Mumtaz Hussain alias Butta VS 

Chief Administrator of Auqaf, Punjab” 

(1976 SCMR 450), that: 

“As the said Ordinance has 

taken  away  the  right  of 

petitioner  to  interim  relief, 

learned  counsel  sulbmitted 

that this was a ground which 

entitle  dthe  petitioner  to 

prosecute  a  writ  petitioner 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 3776/2021 

despite the pendency of the 

proceedings on the District 

Court.  The  argument  is 

misconceived  because  the 

writ  jurisdiction  of  the 

superior  Courts  cannot  be 

invoked  in  aid  of  injustice 

and in order to defeat the 

express  provisions  of  the 

statutory law.” 

12.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed 

to  point  out  as 

to  how 

the 

impugned/interim  order  passed  by 

the 

learned 

Judge  Family  Court  was 

the 

consequence  of  an  error  of  law  or  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.  

13. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
