08.10.2020  Ch. Waseem Bahadur, Advocate for the petitioners 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessary. 

Through the instant writ petition, the petitioners 

impugn  the  judgment  and  decree  dated  27.11.2019 

passed  by  the  Court  of  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge-I  (East),  Islamabad,  whereby  petitioner  No.1's 

appeal  against  the  consolidated  judgment and  decree 

dated 07.10.2019 passed by the learned Judge Family 

Court  was  dismissed.  Vide  the  said  consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated  07.10.2019,  the  learned 

Family  Court  decreed  respondent  No.1‟s  suit  for 

recovery  of  maintenance,  dower  and  dowry  articles 

while  the  suit  filed  by  petitioner  No.1  for  restitution  of 

conjugal rights was conditionally decreed.  

2. 

The 

record  shows 

that  on  05.12.2016, 

respondent  No.1  instituted  the  suit  for  recovery  of 

maintenance,  dower  and  dowry  articles  against  the 

petitioners.  Due  to  the  petitioners‟  absence,  initially 

they  were  proceeded  against  ex-parte  vide  order 

dated  31.01.2017.  Later  on  vide  consent  order  dated 

08.03.2017,  the ex-parte proceedings  were  set-aside. 

Thereafter, 

the  petitioners 

filed  a 

joint  written 

statement  while  petitioner  No.1  instituted  a  counter 

suit 

for 

restitution  of  conjugal 

rights  against 

respondent  No.1.  On  26.04.2017  and  29.05.2017,  the 

learned  Family  Court  framed  following  consolidated 

issues:- 

“1.   Whether  the  plaintiff  is  entitled  for  recovery  of 
maintenance if yes at what rate for which period? 
OPP 

 
                
 
 
 
 
  
 
2 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

1-A   Whether  the  plaintiff  went  abroad/Dubai  without 
permission or consent of the defendant and lived 
abroad at her own will and wish? OPD 

2.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover the dower 
in the shape of 15 tolas gold ornament, half ½ portion 
of house as per nikahnama? OPP 

3.  Whether the plaintiff is entitled to receive the dowry 
articles and gold ornaments as per list attached? 
OPP 

4.  Whether  the  defendant  is  entitled  for  decree  of 
restitution of conjugal rights as prayed for? OPD 
5.  Whether the suit of the plaintiff is  not maintainable 

and liable to be dismissed? OPD 

6.  Relief ?” 

3. 

Respondent  No.1  appeared  as  PW-1  in  support 

of  her  claim  and  also  produced  her  father  Aurangzeb 

Khan  as  PW-2.  The  said  witnesses  were  not  cross-

examined as the learned Family Court vide order dated 

09.01.2018  closed  the  petitioners‟  right  of  cross- 

examination. Petitioner No.1 assailed the said order in 

writ  petition  No.302/2018  which  was  dismissed  vide 

order  dated  01.07.2019  passed  by 

this  Court. 

Respondent  No.1  also  produced  documentary 

evidence  comprising  of  nikahnama dated  25.04.2009 

(Exh.P/3)  and  even  dated 

list  of  dowry  articles 

(Exh.P/4).  

4. 

Petitioner  No.1  appeared  as  DW-1  and 

produced  Amir  Shabbir  as  DW-2.  On  14.11.2018 

petitioners  moved  an  application  for  submission  of 

additional  evidence  inter  alia  consisting  of  rent 

documents  and  salary  slip.  The  said  application  was 

contested  by  respondent  No.1.  Vide  order  dated 

11.02.2019,  the  learned  Family  Court  dismissed  the 

petitioners‟ said application.  

5. 

The 

trial  culminated 

in 

the  consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated  07.10.2019  whereby  the 

learned  Family Court decreed  respondent No. 1‟s suit 

for  recovery  of  maintenance,  dower  and  dowry 

articles  to  the  extent  that  respondent  No.1  was  held 

entitled  to  (i)  maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/- 

per month from the date of the institution of the suit till 

 
 
3 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

subsistence  of  the  marriage;  (ii)  15  tolas  gold 

ornaments  and  half  portion  of  the  house  mentioned  in 

nikahnama  as  dower,  and; 

(iii)  dowry  articles 

according to respondent No.1‟s list (Exh.P/4). Through 

the  same  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated 

07.10.2019, the learned Family Court also decreed the 

suit  filed  by  petitioner  No.1  for  restitution  of  conjugal 

rights  subject  to  the  condition  that  he  pays  dower  to 

respondent No.1 as per nikahnama and maintains her. 

6. 

Petitioner  No.1  preferred  an  appeal  against  the 

said  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  to  the  extent 

of decreeing the suit filed by respondent No.1. During 

pendency  of  the  said  appeal,  petitioner  No.2,  on 

23.11.2019, filed an application under Order I, Rule 10 

C.P.C.  for  becoming  a  party  to  the  said  appeal.  Vide 

order  dated  27.11.2019,  the  said  application  was 

dismissed  for  having  been  filed  after  the  expiry  of  the 

limitation  period  for  filing  an  appeal.  The  learned 

Appellate  Court  dismissed  petitioner  No.1‟s  appeal 

vide 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.11.2019. Hence this petition. 

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  submitted 

that the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by 

the learned Courts below are against the documentary 

and  oral  evidence  produced  by  the  petitioners;  that 

the  learned  trial  Court  dismissed  the  petitioners‟ 

application 

for  additional  documents  on  hyper-

technical grounds causing miscarriage of justice; that 

the 

learned 

trial  Court  unlawfully  closed 

the 

petitioners‟  right  to  cross-examine  respondent  No.1‟s 

witnesses  vide  order  dated  09.01.2018;  that  while 

deciding  writ  petition  No.302/2018  filed  by  petitioner 

No.1  against  the  said  order  dated  09.01.2018,  this 

Court  had  held  that  the  petitioners  can  challenge  the 

said  order  at  the  time  of  filing  an  appeal  against  the 

final  order;  that  the  learned  appellate  Court,  in  its 

 
4 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

impugned  judgment  dated  27.11.2019,  did  not  return 

any  finding  on  this  important  aspect  of  the  case;  that 

by  not  allowing  the  petitioners  to  cross-examine  the 

witnesses of respondent No.1, they were deprived of a 

proper  opportunity  of  defence;  that  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are  based  on  respondent 

No.1‟s  evidence  which  was  not  allowed 

to  be 

subjected  to  cross-examination;  that  due  weightage 

was  not  given  to  the  evidence  of  the  petitioners;  that 

the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  suffer  from 

misreading  and  non-reading  of  the  evidence;  that  the 

half  portion  of  house  was  decreed 

in  favour  of 

respondent  No.1 without  considering  that the same  is 

not  owned  by  petitioner  No.1  and  is  a  mortgaged 

property  against  a  loan  given  by  House  Building 

Finance  Corporation 

to  petitioner  No.2; 

that 

respondent  No.1‟s  suit  pertaining  to  matrimonial 

obligations  against  petitioner  No.1  could  not  have 

included  petitioner  No.2  as  a  party;  that  the  learned 

Courts  below  passed  the  judgments  and  decrees 

against petitioner No.2 without having jurisdiction; that 

the  gold  ornaments  had  been  decreed  in  respondent 

No.1‟s  favour  despite  the  fact  that  the  same  were  in 

possession of the said respondent; that the impugned 

judgments and decrees are against the law and facts; 

and  that  the  same  have  been  passed  arbitrarily 

without  proper  application  of  judicial  mind.  Learned 

counsel for the petitioners prayed for the writ petition 

to be allowed in terms of the relief sought therein.  

8. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioners  and  have  perused  the 

record  with  his  able  assistance.  The  facts  leading  to 

the  filing  of  the  instant  petition  have  been  set  out  in 

sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  2  to  6  above  and  need 

not be recapitulated.

W.P.No.2316/2020 

9. 

  The  petitioners‟  grievance  with  regard  to  the 

order  dated  09.01.2018,  whereby  their  right  of  cross-

examination was closed is that the said order was not 

passed  in  accordance  with  law.  Now,  the  record 

shows 

that  on  15.06.2017  after  submission  of 

affidavits-in-evidence by respondent No.1, the learned 

Family  Court  adjourned  the  case  to  11.07.2017  inter 

alia 

for  cross-examination  on  respondent  No.1‟s 

witnesses.  Thereafter, 

the  proceedings  were 

adjourned  on  four  occasions  (i.e.  on  11.07.2017, 

23.09.2017,  04.11.2017  and  18.12.2017)  either 

because the petitioners‟ counsel was absent or he was 

not prepared to conduct cross- examination. The order 

sheet  shows  that  the  learned  Family  Court  on  three 

occasions  gave  last  and  final  opportunities  to  the 

petitioners to conduct the cross-examination. Even on 

09.01.2018,  before  closing  the  petitioners‟  right  of 

cross-examination,  the  learned  Family  Court  took  up 

the  case  thrice  after  the  first  call.  Therefore,  I  am  of 

the view that sufficient opportunities had been given to 

the  petitioners  to  conduct  cross-examination.  Due  to 

the  petitioners‟  persistent  default,  the  learned  Family 

Court  was  correct 

to  have 

invoked 

the  penal 

provisions  of  the  special  law.  The  petitioners  are  to 

blame for the consequences of their default in ignoring 

the repeated directions of the learned Family Court.   

10. 

The  petitioners‟  contention  that  respondent 

No.1‟s  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance,  dower  and 

dowry articles was not maintainable against petitioner 

No.2  (i.e. father  of  her  husband/petitioner  No.1)  does 

not  inspire  confidence.    Under  Section  2(d)  of  the 

Family Court Act,  1964 (“the 1964 Act”), a suit can be 

filed  against 

„any  person‟  whose  presence 

is 

considered  necessary  for  proper  decision  of  dispute. 

Now,  since  nikahnama  (Exh.P/3)  is  an  admitted 

document  and  half  share  in  the  house  owned  by 

 
6 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

petitioner  No.2  was  alienated  against  dower  of 

respondent  No.1  in  columns  No.  14,  15  and  16  of  the 

said  document  and  since  petitioner  No.2  had  signed 

the  said  Exh.P/3,  his  presence  was  definitely 

necessary  for  proper  decision  of  the  dispute  qua 

recovery of dower.  

11. 

Furthermore,  nikahnama  (Exh.P/3)  is 

a 

registered  document  and 

it  was  also  signed  by 

petitioner  No.2.  Petitioner  No.2  was  thus  not  only 

aware but conscious of the transfer of half share in the 

house  mentioned  in  Exh.P/3.  As  such  it  was  rightly 

decreed  by  the  learned  Courts  below  in  favour  of 

respondent No.1. In the case of Mst. Shumaila Bibi VS 

Zahir  Khan  (PLD  2015  Peshawar  182),  the  petitioner 

before  the  Hon‟ble  Peshawar  High  Court  challenged 

the  appellate  judgment  and  decree  whereby  dower  in 

the shape of husband‟s share in the house of his father 

was excluded from the decree. The learned High Court 

returned  its  findings  on  this  crucial  question  in  the 

following terms:- 

“14.  It is established rule that the husband could 
not give any property in dower to his wife that did 
not belong to him but belong to some one else, but if 
the father of bridegroom consented and agreed to 
do so. Admittedly there is no rule that the father has 
the liability to give the debts of his son, but in such 
like situation when a father consented to give his 
daughter in law the specific property or portion of 
the property as her share in lieu of dower, hence the 
father assumed the direct liability and stood surety, 
when his presence at the time of scribing of Nikah 
Nama during Nikah ceremony, is not denied and 
proved during course of trial as in the instant case. 
This view was further fortified in the case of Maj. 
Rifat Nawaz and 5 others v. Mst. Tahira and 2 others 
(2008 CLC 803) by holding that; 

"That father in law could give a dower of movable as 
well as immovable property on the eve of his son's 
marriage particularly when Nikah Nama contained 
the  stipulation  regarding  the  dower  with  full 
particular in shape of boundaries of the said house.-
Said Nikah Nama had also been thumb impressed by 
the father of the defendant---Document in question 
had been fully proved in the record of the case." 

 
 
 
 
7 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

15.  In the instant case, the Nikah deed Exh.PW-2/l 
has been signed by the respondent No.2 and it is 
also admitted that he was present at the time of 
Nikah which fact has further been supported from 
his  own  statement  (respondent  No.2)  who  had 
deposed  before  the  trial  Court  in,  his  cross-
examinations DW-2 that he was present at the time 
of Nikah between the petitioner and respondent 
No.1.  Admitted  that  the  respondent  No.2  was 
present at the time of Nikah ceremony and it is also 
proved that he was in full knowledge of the terms 
and conditions of the Nikah Nama being written in 
his  presence  and  with  his  consent  being  elder 
(father of the respondent No.1). 

16.  As per our customs, thus, an inference can be 
drawn  that  the  respondent  No.  2  was  in  full 
agreement to give his house (to the extent of share 
of respondent No.1) to his daughter-in-law. In this 
regard the case of Mst. Shehnaz Akhtar v. Fida 
Hussain and 2 others (2007 CLC 1517) is worth 
reliance wherein it was held as; 

"Question arose as to whether plaintiff could file suit 
against  father  of  bridegroom  for  completion  of 
contract executed by him for the payment of dower--
-Held, there was no bar or prohibition in the way of 
plaintiff in that regard, so as to impede the way of 
plaintiff  from  claiming  the  implementation  and 
completion of the agreement---Family Court, under 
S.5, West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 had 
exclusive  jurisdiction  to  entertain,  hear  and 
adjudicate upon matters specified in Par-1 of the 
Schedule to the said Act and there was no barring 
provision  that  while  claiming  dower  from  the 
husband  only  bridegroom/husband  could  be 
impleaded in the suit for recovery of dower and 
none else-lf another person had stood surety or had 
guaranteed the payment of dower, he/she could 
lawfully  be  impleaded  in  the  suit-Surety  and 
guarantor to the dower were as much party and 
liable to pay dower as the bridegroom himself." 

17.  It was further held in the case of Muhammad 
Anwar Khan v. Sabia Khanam PLD 2010 Lah. 119 
that; " the house mentioned in the Nikah Nama as 
dower for daughter in law, even though, it did not 
belong to the husband of respondent is liable to be 
transferred to the daughter in law as the father in 
law had given his consent for the same."  

18.  Needless to remark that in spite of having the 
knowledge that his house was being given to the 
petitioner as dower but he did not object/take any 
legal action to exclude the same from the Nikah 
Nama till the filing of the present by the petitioner.” 

12. 

It is pertinent to mention that petitioner No.2 did 

not  file  an  appeal  against  the  judgment  and  decree 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

dated 07.10.2019 passed by the learned Family Court. 

After  the  expiry  of  the  limitation  period  for  filing  an 

appeal  provided  in  the  West  Pakistan  Family  Courts 

Rules,  1965  petitioner  No.2,  on  23.11.2019,  moved  an 

application  for  becoming  party  in  the  appeal  filed  by 

petitioner  No.1.  Petitioner  No.2  was  not  allowed  to 

become a party to  the said appeal and his application 

to  the  said  effect  was  dismissed  vide  order  dated 

27.11.2019  passed  by  the  learned  appellate  Court. 

Consequently,  this  writ  petition  to  the  extent  of 

petitioner  No.2  is  not  maintainable  since  he  failed  to 

avail  remedy  of  appeal  under  Section  14  of  the  1964 

Act.  

13. 

The  petitioners  are  also aggrieved  by  the order 

passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court  dismissing  their 

application  for  additional  evidence.  Section  9  of  the 

1964 Act provides that “where a defendant relies upon 

a document  in his  possession or  power,  he shall 

produce it or copy thereof in the Court alongwith the 

written  statement.”  The  petitioners 

filed 

the 

application  for  additional  evidence  at  a  belated  stage 

(i.e.  on  14.11.2018)  when  their  witnesses  had  already 

been cross-examined and the plaintiff/respondent No.1 

had already exposed lacunae in the defence evidence 

on  crucial  points,  including  petitioner  No.1‟s  income 

and  the  title  of  the  house  (which  was  the  subject 

matter of dower). These were areas where absence of 

defence evidence had been exposed during the cross-

examination  of  defence  witnesses.  Allowing 

the 

application  to  produce  petitioner  No.1‟s  salary  slip  or 

rent  documents  would  have  amounted  to  letting  the 

petitioners  set  up  a  fresh  case.    The  record  further 

shows  that  no  reason  or  justification  whatsoever  was 

given  in  the  petitioners'  application  for  not  filing  the 

said documents along with their written statement. For 

these  reasons,  I  hold  that  the  learned  Family  Court‟s 

 
9 

W.P.No.2316/2020 

order  dated  11.02.2019  dismissing  the  petitioners‟ 

application  for  additional  evidence  was  strictly  in 

accordance with law. 

14.  Besides 

the 

fact 

that 

the  witnesses  of 

respondent  No.1  were  not  cross-examined  and  their 

statement 

remained  unchallenged, 

the 

learned 

appellate  Court  in  the  impugned 

judgment  dated 

27.11.2019,  apart  from  relying  on  the  statement  of 

respondent  No.1‟s  witnesses  has  comprehensively 

appraised the evidence and referred to the admissions 

of  petitioner  No.1/DW-1  on  important  questions  with 

regard  to  the  entitlement  of  respondent  No.1  for 

maintenance,  dower  and  dowry  articles.  The 

petitioners  were  not  able  to  show  that  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  passed  by  the learned  Courts 

below suffered from any misreading or non-reading of 

any material piece of evidence.  

15. 

In  view  of  the  above,  I  find  no  merit  in  this 

petition, which is dismissed in limine.
