GHULAM  AZAM  QAMBBANLT.: The  petitioner  namely  Shahbaz 

Ahmad  seeks  post  arrest  bail  in  case  F.l.R  No.451/2019  dated

Telegraph  Act,1885registered  with  Police  Station  Industrial  Area, 

Islamabad. 

2. 

Briefly, prosecution  case  is  that  on  04.09.2019,  one  Adalat 

Hussain/complainant  moved an application to the  S.H.O  Police Station 

Industrial  Area,  Islamabad,  with  the  averments  that  from  last  two 

days,he is receiving threatening  text  messages  and  calls from mobile 

No.0312-1666156  on  his  own  mobile  No.0345-5899051;  that  on 

29.08.2019  at  about  11:32am,  he  received  a  call  from  said  mobile 

number  without  disclosing his identity, extended threats  for death and 

also threats  for abduction of his son; it has been further alleged that the 

complainant through his own sources confirmed that the same number

Crl.Misc.No.43-B/2020 

is registered  in the name of one Murtaza Ali s/o TasleemAhmed who is 

a stranger  for him and his family members hence, the instant F.l.R. 

3. 

After usual investigation the petitioner  alongwith four other  co  

accused  persons  were  transmitted  to  judicial custody  on  10.09.2019; 

thereafter,  the petitioner  filed bail application before the learned  Court 

of  Special Judge Anti-Terrorism-II, Islamabad,  which  was  dismissed 

vide order  dated  16.12.2019. 

4. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argued  that  there  is 

inordinate  and  unexplained delay of seven days which cast doubts  on 

the  veracity  of the  prosecution  story; that  noting has  been  recovered 

from  the  possession  of  petitioner  and  he  has  no  nexus  with  the 

commission  of the  alleged offence and  lastly, contended  that  the  co  

accused namely Murtaza Ali has been granted  bail, therefore,  principle 

of consistency exists on the basis whereof the petitioner  is entitled for 

the concession of grant of bail. 

5. 

On  the  other  hand, learned  State  counsel vehemently  opposed 

the contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioner  contending 

that  the  petitioner  is  involved in  the  commission of offence and  the 

alleged  offences  are  heinous  one  and  prayed  for  dismissal  of  the 

petition. 

6.  We have  heard  that  arguments  of the  learned  counsel  for the 

parties and have gone through the available record. 

7. 

The  record  transpires  that  on  16.09.2019,  a  mobile  phone 

bearing I.M.E.I No.4496091204513 was recovered on the pointation of 

co-accused  Ibrar  Ahmedand  different  SIM  numbers  have  also  been 

recovered 

from  accused  Murtaza  Ali  and  allegedly  from  the 

3 

Crl.Misc.No.43-B/2020 

petitionerwith  the  allegation that  threatening  calls were  received  for 

the  demand  of "Bhatta",  Section 506 P.P.C  and Section 25-D Telegraph 

Act are  bailable in nature  while punishment  provided  for Section 387 

P.P.C does not fall within the prohibitory clause of 497 Cr.P.C. 

8. 

Perusal  of  the 

record 

reveals 

that 

the  only  piece  of 

evidenceavailable  on  record  is  Call  Data Record. The  messages  have 

been notified which have been conveyed through  an unknown number 

but  it is yet to be determined  as to how and when the  messages were 

conveyed. The petitioner  is  no  more  required  to  the  prosecution  for 

any probe, challan has already been submitted  and the trial is at initial 

stage. Deeper appreciation  at bail stage is not permissible  and we are 

required  to  make  tentative  assessment  of the  evidence  available on 

record.Guilt of the  petitioner  is yet  to  be  determined  by the  learned 

Trial  Court after  recording  of prosecution  evidence. As  such, case  of 

petitioner  falls within ambit of further  inquiry in terms  of Section 497 

(2) Cr.P.C.  The accused, Mumtaz Ali  has  already  been  granted  bail, as 

such, the principle of consistency also exists, therefore, the petitioner is 

entitled  for  the  concession of post  arrest  bail. Resultantly, we  allow 

this petition. The petitioner  is admitted to post arrest  bail subject to his 

furnishing bail bonds in the sum of Rs.2,00,000 /- (Rupees two lac) with 

two  sureties  in  the  like  amount  to  the  satisfaction  of learned  Trial 

Court.
