Mr. Sakhawar Hussain, ASC.

LUBNA SALEEM PERVEZ, J.  

The petitioner, Majid Hafeez, through 

instant writ petition has assailed order dated  20.02.2019, passed by learned 

Judge  Family  Court,  East-Islamabad,  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  Trial 

Court),  whereby  the  learned  Trial  Court  directed  the  petitioner  to  pay 

monthly interim maintenance at the rate of Rs.12,000/- each for two minors  

(total Rs. 24,000/-).  

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that  the  interim 

maintenance  fixed  is  beyond  his  capacity  and  he  cannot  afford  to  pay  Rs. 

24,000/- per month as interim maintenance of the minors on the ground that 

he is a sales man at Al-Moeez Traders on the monthly salary of Rs. 20,000/-. 

He  submitted  that  the  learned  Trial  Court  has  failed  to  appreciate  this  fact 

and  has  passed  the  impugned  order  by  imposing  exorbitant  interim 

maintenance for the minors.  

3. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  Nos.  1  to  3 

submitted  that  the  writ  petition  for  reducing  the  interim  maintenance  fixed 

by  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  is  not  maintainable  and  in  support  of  this 

contention  she  placed  reliance  on  case  laws  reported  as  Mashkoor  Ahmed 

Khokhar  v.  The  Family  Judge  (East),  Islamabad  (2019  CLC  1635),

Waris v. Ibrahim Aqueel Waris (2020 CLC 131). She prayed for dismissal 

of  instant petition on the ground of maintainability.

5. 

Arguments heard. Record perused.  

The  learned  Trial  Court,  vide  impugned  order  dated  20.02.2019  has 

fixed  interim  maintenance  for 2  minor  children  of  the  petitioner,  which  he 

has  assailed  herein  by  invoking  the  constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  court 

under Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution of Pakistan, 1973, as a writ of 

certiorari  and  has  prayed  for  setting-aside  of  the  impugned  interim  order, 

whereby, the learned Trial Court has passed order in terms of section 17-A 

of  the  Family  Court  Act,  1964  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  Act,  1964) 

which  provision  empowers  the  learned  Family  Court  to  fix  a  provisional 

monthly  maintenance  keeping  in  view  the  income  of  the  father  during  the 

proceedings in the suit of maintenance till its decision. The purpose of this 

section  appears  to  be  that  the  minors  who  are  dependent  and  are  the 

responsibility of the father should be saved from facing monetary difficulties 

and may be able to manage the routine necessary expenditures till the trial in 

the  suit  for  maintenance  is  finalized,  as  such,  the  findings  of  the  learned 

Family  Court  in  the  impugned  order  are  only  tentative  in  nature  and  not 

final. Whereas, proper quantum of the maintenance allowance is fixed by the 

learned  Family  Court,  after  recording  of  evidence  as  the  issue  of  final 

maintenance  requires  probe  into  the  facts  regarding  financial  status  and 

source  of  income  and  the  High  Courts  should  refrain  from  involving  in 

determination of facts, being beyond the scope of Article 199 (1)(a)(ii) of the 

Constitution,  1973,  for  the  reason  that  such  jurisdiction  is  exercised  only 

against  the  act  done  or  proceedings  taken  by  the  functionary  which  are 

without lawful authority and of no legal effect.  Guidance in this regard has 

been  sought  from  the  case  law  reported  as  Ghulam  Muhammad  and 

another VSMst. Noor Bibi and others (1980 SCMR 933), Benedict F.D

Souza VSKarachi Building Control Authority and others (1989 SCMR 

918)  and  Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others  VS Major  (Retd.) 

Muhammad Sabir Khan (PLD 1991 SC 476).  

6. 

Section 14 of the Act, 1964, provides for an appeal against the orders 

passed by learned Family Court. Sub-section (3) has been inserted in section 

14 of the Act, vide Ordinance LV of 2002 which prohibits filing of appeal or 

revision  against  interim  orders  passed  by  the  learned  Family  Court. 

Therefore,  interference  by  this  Court,  exercising  discretionary  jurisdiction 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution,  against  interim  orders passed by  the 

learned  Family  Court  would  defeat  the  purpose  of  insertion  of  sub-section 

(3) of section 14 of the Act, 1964. In view thereof, I am of the considered 

opinion that the learned Family Court has lawfully exercised its jurisdiction 

under section 17-A of the Act, 1964 for fixing interim maintenance for the 

minors, as such, no illegality has been committed by the learned Judge while 

passing impugned order dated 20.02.2019.  

7. 

For  what has been discussed above, the instant petition is  held to be 

without any substance and is hereby, dismissed. However, the Family Court 

is directed to conclude the trial and finalize the suit within a period of thirty 

days from the date of receipt of this order.
