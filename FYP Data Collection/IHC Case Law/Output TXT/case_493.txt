SAMAN RAFAT IMTIAZ, J.:-     Through  the  instant  writ  petition  under 

Article  199  of 

the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973 

(“Constitution”)  the  Petitioners  have  assailed  Judgments  &  Decrees  dated 

22.09.2018 and 23.02.2019 passed by learned Family Court (East) Islamabad and 

learned Additional District Judge-III (East) Islamabad, respectively.  

2. 

Brief  facts  are  that  the  Petitioners  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance, house rent, dowry articles including gold ornaments and possession of a 

room  of  residential  house  with  the  averments  that  the  Petitioner  No.1  and  the 

Respondent  No.1  were  married on  02.07.2000  against  dower of  Rs.5000/-, seven 

Tolas ornaments and a residential room of house.  That the cash dower was never 

paid,  7  Tolas  gold  ornaments  were  given  but  the  same  were  snatched  by  the 

Respondents  after  marriage,  whereas  the  possession  of  residential  room  has  not 

been  handed  over  to  the  petitioners.  That  at  the  time  of  marriage,  parents  of 

Petitioner  No.1  gave  her  dowry  articles  and  gold  ornaments  weighing  11  Tolas, 

which  are  still  in  possession  of  the  Respondent  No.1.  From  this  wedlock  four 

minors  (Petitioners  No.2  to  4  and  Omar  Waheed  son  (who  died  during  the 

pendency of the suit) were born, who are living with Petitioner No.1. That after the 

marriage the Respondent No.1 maltreated Petitioner No.1 and he was in the habit 

of humiliating, harassing,  beating, abusing, and insulting Petitioner No.1 on petty 

matters. That on number of occasions, the Respondent No.1 ousted Petitioner No.1 

from his house but she rejoined on the intervention of elders of their families and 

Jirgas.  That  the  Respondent  No.1  never  maintained  the  petitioners  and  all  the 

 
 
 
 
 
     
2                                                                                                                                     W.P. No.544/2020 

delivery expenses/medicines and other miscellaneous expenses were borne by the 

parents  of  Petitioner  No.1.  That  on  23.11.2012  the  Respondent  No.1  verbally 

divorced Petitioner No.1. 

3. 

The suit was contested by the Respondent No.1 by filing written statement. 

Issues  were  framed.  The  parties  produced  their  evidence  and  after  hearing  the 

arguments,  learned  Family  Court  vide  Impugned  Judgment  &  Decree  dated 

22.09.2018  partially  decreed  the  suit  to  the  effect  that  Petitioner  No.1  is  granted 

Khula  as  an  alternative  relief,  subject  to  relinquishment  of  dower  @  Rs.5000/-. 

Petitioner  No.1  is  entitled  to  receive  maintenance  @Rs.5000/-  per  month  for  the 

Iddat period. Son of Petitioner No.1 Omar Waheed (who died during pendency of 

the suit) was found entitled for past maintenance @Rs.1500/- per month from the 

date of institution of the suit till the date of his death. The Petitioners No.2 to 4 are 

entitled  for  recovery  of  past  maintenance  @Rs.1500/-  since  05.12.2012,  till 

decision  of  the  case  and  for  recovery  of  future  maintenance  @Rs.2700/-  from 

decision  of  the  case  till  their  legal  entitlement  with  10%  annual  increase  due  in 

September, 2019. Petitioner No.1 is entitled to recover Rs.10,000/- in alternate of 

the remaining dowry  articles  mentioned  in  the list  Ex-P4,  whereas the  remaining 

claims of Petitioner No.1 were dismissed.  

4. 

Feeling  aggrieved  by  the  Judgment  &  Decree  of  Family  Court,  both 

Petitioner  No.1  and  Respondent  No.1  filed  their  appeals  before  the  Court  of 

learned  Additional  District  (East)  Islamabad.  Appeal  filed  by  the  Petitioner  was 

partially  allowed  and  the  matter  was  remanded  to  learned  trial  court  to  decide 

afresh  issue  No.1  pertaining  to  the  claim  made  by  the  appellant  to  the  extent  of 

recovery  of  11  Tolas  gold,  whereas  appeal  filed  by  the  Respondent  No.1  was 

dismissed vide Impugned Judgment & Decree dated 23.02.2019.  

5. 

The instant writ has been filed by the Petitioner  challenging the Judgments 

&  Decrees  dated  22.09.2018  and  23.02.2019  passed  by  learned  Family  Court 

(East) Islamabad and learned Additional District Judge-III (East) Islamabad only to 

the extent of recovery of maintenance allowance, house rent and dowry articles.   

6. 

Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that Impugned Judgments and 

Decrees  dated  22.09.2018  and  23.02.2019  to  the  extent  of  past  and  future 

maintenance of the petitioners are illegal, perverse, arbitrary as the petitioners No.2 

3                                                                                                                                     W.P. No.544/2020 

to 4, who are minor and school going and their expenses are increasing day by day 

due to inflation; that Impugned Judgments and Decrees are based on presumptions; 

that Impugned Judgments and Decrees are result of misreading and non-reading of 

evidence; that Impugned Judgments and Decrees are  against the  law and facts of 

the case.  

7. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  Respondent  No.1  contended  that  maintenance  is 

always fixed keeping in view financial status of father; that the Respondent No.1 is 

daily wager/labourer; that no evidence was produced by Petitioner No.1 regarding 

financial  status  of  the  Respondent  No.1,  therefore,  maintenance  of  the  petitioner 

has not been fixed in accordance with law.  

8. 

9. 

I have heard the arguments and perused the record.  

First and foremost, it has to be borne in mind that this Court in exercise of 

Constitutional jurisdiction does not act like a Court of appeal.  As such, the Court 

cannot embark upon a reappraisal of evidence.  It is settled law that a High Court 

in  such  jurisdiction  cannot  substitute  the  concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below 

with its own findings solely on the ground that another view was possible on the 

same  evidence.    A  party  approaching  the  High  Court  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution has to demonstrate that there is a gross misreading or non-reading of 

evidence or jurisdictional error or such legal infirmity that has caused miscarriage 

of justice.  

10.  The  Impugned  Judgment  dated  22-09-2018  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court reflects that the Petitioner was admittedly unaware of the source of 

income of the Respondent No. 1.  On the other hand, it is noted from the Impugned 

Judgment  dated  22-09-2018  that  the  Respondent  No.  1  stated  in  his  cross-

examination that he worked at a shop and earned Rs.1,000/- per month at the time 

of  his  marriage  with  the  Petitioner  and  that  at  present  he  earns  Rs.6,000/-  to 

Rs.7,000/-  per  month.    The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  admitted  that  no 

proof  of  the  Respondent  No.  1’s  income  was  produced  by  her.  In  view  of  the 

above,  the  learned  Family  Court  correctly  passed  the  Judgment  whereby  the 

Petitioners  No.2  to  4  were  found  entitled  for  recovery  of  past  maintenance 

4                                                                                                                                     W.P. No.544/2020 

@Rs.1500/-  since 05.12.2012, till decision of the case and for recovery of future 

maintenance @Rs.2700/- from decision of the case till their legal entitlement with 

10%  annual  increase  due  in  September,  2019,  which  was  rightly  upheld  by  the 

learned  Appellate  Court.    No  misreading  or  non-reading  of  evidence  could  be 

pointed out by the learned counsel for the Petitioner. 

5. 

The sole argument raised was that the amount of maintenance is too meager.  

However, he was unable to satisfy this Court as to how factual disputes involving 

the Respondent No. 1’s income and the needs of the Petitioners No. 2 to 4 can be 

decided in writ jurisdiction. Even otherwise, in answer to a specific query in this 

regard,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  stated  that  according  to  him  the 

maintenance  for  each  minor  child  should  be  Rs.5000/-  per  month.  He  also 

acknowledged that learned Family Court had also allowed 10% annual increase on 

the maintenance allowance decreed.  On calculation, he conceded that the current 

amount  of  monthly  maintenance  is  substantially  close  to  what  is  admittedly  a 

reasonable amount of maintenance. Therefore, there appears to be no miscarriage 

of  justice.    Even otherwise,  the  Petitioners  have  an  alternate  remedy  to  approach 

the learned Family Court for enhancement of maintenance allowance.  

11. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  no  reasonable  grounds  have  been  made  out  for 

interference  with  the  concurrent  findings  of  the  Courts  below  in  exercise  of  writ 

jurisdiction.  As such, the instant petition is dismissed as being devoid of merit.
