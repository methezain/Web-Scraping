Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or 
counsel where necessary.  

05.09.2022  Nemo. 

 This matter was  earlier taken  up on its turn but 

none appeared on behalf of the petitioner. 

The  case  was  again  called  before  rising  of  the 

Court.  There  is  no  representation  on  behalf  of  the 

petitioner.  It  seems  that  the  petitioner  has  lost  interest 

in the matter.  

In  view  of  above, 

instant  writ  petition 

is 

dismissed for non-prosecution.
