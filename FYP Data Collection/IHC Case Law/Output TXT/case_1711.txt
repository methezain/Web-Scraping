04.02.2020 Rana Liaqat Hayat, Advocate for petitioner

Contends  that the local police is  causing
harassment to the petitioner and rest of her family

members,  inter-alia on account  of involvement of her

husband in some criminal cases.  According to the

learned  counsel, the unlawful  act of respondents  2 to
4  amounts to  transgression of  authority  in
contravention of fundamental  right i.e. right to life

and liberty.

Heard. Every public functionary is  under
obligation to act in accordzulce  with law and refrain

from causing any illegal harassment.  The petition  is,

therefore, disposed of with direction  to respondents

2 to 4 {IGP, SSP & SHO  P.S. Sihala, ICT} to refrain
from causing harassment  or commit unlawful act

and are directed to abide  by the law, in letter and
spirit. However, this direction shall not be
considered  an impediment  for taking lawful  action

by following due course.
