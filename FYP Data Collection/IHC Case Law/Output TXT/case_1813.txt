Through  this writ petition, petitioner has assailed

the order dated  30.05.2019 passed by learned

Additional Sessions  Judge, Islamabad  (West)  whereby,

petition under section 491  Cr.PC flled by the petitioner

has been dismissed.
2.  Learned  counsel for petitioner  contends that

respondent No.4/Aksa Kanwa!/real  daughter  of

petitioner,  who was  kidnapped by respondents No.2 &

3 and compelled  to enter into marriage contract  on

02.10.2018  under the duress and coercion;  that

learned  Additional Sessions  Judge, Islamabad (West)

has not considered  the merits of case as well  as law on

subject and dismissed the petition  despite  the fact that

the petitione/s  claim was about life and libefi of her

daughter  Aksa Kanwal in terms of fundamental

guarantees  provided in the Constitution  of Islamic

Republic  of Pakistan,  L973.

W.P. No.2772-2O19.

3.  Conversely,  learned counsel  for respondents

No.2 to 4 contends that respondent  No.4/Aksa  Kanwal

entered into marriage  with her free will with

respondent  No.2 on 02.10.2018 and at present is living

with him in a peaceful manner  and was not forced to

enter  into matrimonial bond.
4.  Arguments heard, record perused.
5.  Perusal of record reveals that the petitioner

Farhat  Khurshid  (real mother of alleged  aMuctee)  filed

petition under  section 491 Cr.PC for recovery  of her

daughter/respondent  No.4 aged about 19 years, who

was allegedly kidnapped  and forced to enter into

matrimonial  bond with respondent No.2  on 02.10.2018

against  her wishes.  Notice was issued to respondents

No.2 to 4 whereafter,  respondent  No.4 (alleged

abductee) put appearance  before the Coutt today.  She

was interuiewed  at length, however she negated  the

version of petitioner and stated that she is educated

lady and sui-juris, who can understand  the nature of

her relationship  with respondent  No.2.  Respondent

No.4 further stated  that she was neither  kidnapped  nor

abducted by anyone rather  she entered  into Nikah with

respondent  No.2 with her own free will.
6.  After recording  of statement  of respondent No.4

in open Couft, both the parties were  given time of two

hours to settle the family dispute  outside the Coutt.

Case was again called  whereupon,  respondent No.4

reiterated  her previous stance  and expressed  her

willingness  to call her mother  (present  petitioner)  on

mobile  as and when she likes. She fufther  states that

she will visit her mother and other family  members

whenever she feels comfortable.
7. 

In view of above, claim of petitioner is not

made  out as respondent No.4 is sui-iuris,  who entered

into marriage  contract with respondent  No.2, on

02.10.2018  and since 23.01.2019, she is living  with  her

husband.  There is no element of kidnapping  and
abduction, therefore, instant writ petition  is

misconceived, same  stands dismissed. Office is

directed to transmit  copy of this order to the S.H.O.

Police Station  Secretariat,  Islamabad  for information.
