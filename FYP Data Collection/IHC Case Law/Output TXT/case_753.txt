VS          

Additional District Judge, Islamabad (East) and others  

S. No. of order 
/ proceedings 

Date of  order/ 
Proceedings 
26.01.2022  Mr.  Abdur  Rehman  Malik,  Advocate  for  the 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary. 

petitioner. 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner,  Raja  Sajjad  Munir, 

impugns 

the 

judgment and decree dated 15.01.2022 passed by 

the Court of the learned Additional District Judge, 

Islamabad,  whereby  his  appeal  against 

the 

judgment and decree dated 27.02.2021 passed by 

the  learned  Guardian  Judge,  was  partly  allowed. 

The  learned  Courts  below  concurrently  held  that 

respondent  No.3  (Noshaba  Sajjad)  was  entitled  to 

the  custody  of  minor  children.  The 

learned 

Guardian  Judge  had  also  fixed  the  maintenance 

for  the  minor  children  but  the  learned  Appellate 

Court  held  that  since  respondent  No.3  had  not 

prayed for the grant of maintenance, she could file 

a separate suit for the said purpose.  

Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted 

that 

the  minor  children  have  been 

in 

the 

petitionerâ€™s custody since 2019 and the welfare of 

the  minors  would  be  served,  if  their  custody 

continues to remain with the petitioner.  

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  further 

submitted  that  the  minors  can  be  brought  to  this 

Court  and  ask  whether  they  want  to  continue  to 

remain  with  the  petitioner.  This  would  be  an 

exercise 

in  futility  since  the 

learned  counsel 

admitted that ever since 2019 the minors have not 

had visitation with their mother / respondent No.3. 

Issue notice to respondent No.3. 

                
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It  is  clarified  that  the  issuance  of  notice  to 

respondent  No.3  will  not  operate  as 

the 

suspension  of  the  operation  of  the  impugned 

judgments and decrees.  

Office  is  directed  to  transmit  a  copy  of  this 

order to the learned Trial Court / Executing Court.  

C.M.No.01/2022 

Notice.  At  this  stage,  I  am  not  inclined  to 

suspend the operation of the impugned judgments 

and decrees.   

C.M.No.02/2022 

Exemption  sought  for  is  allowed  subject  to 

all just and legal exceptions.
