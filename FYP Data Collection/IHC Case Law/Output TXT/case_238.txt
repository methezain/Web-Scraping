  The  Chief  Commissioner, 

Islamabad 

Capital  Territory  (ICT),  has  appeared 

in 

person and states that while efforts are being 

made by the Chief Commissioner’s office in its 

capacity as provincial government for ICT, the 

National  Commission  on  the  Rights  of  the 

Child  Act,  2017,  and  the  Islamabad  Capital 

Territory  Child  Protection  Act,  2018,  does  not 

envisage  a  role  for  the  Chief  Commissioner’s 

office  to  discharge  any  duty.  He  states  that 

notwithstanding the provisions of the law, the 

Chief  Commissioner’s  office  has  notified  a 

committee  by  notification  dated  30.11.2022 

and responsibilities have been assigned to the 

committee to ensure that the provisions of the 

two Acts are given effect such that the benefit

committee  has  been  endowed  with 

the 

responsibility  to  submit  a  report  and  provide

Chief  Commissioner’s  office,  in  which  the 

responsible  divisions  that  have  to  give  effect 

to the relevant provisions of the two Acts have 

been 

identified  and 

it  appears  that  the 

requisite steps to be taken are pending before 

the  Ministry  of  Human  Rights,  the  Ministry  of 

Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice  and 

the  Ministry  of  Federal  Education  and 

Professional Training.

Commissioner’s  office  and  consult  with  the

and file a joint report that has been signed by 

all  the  four  Secretaries  of  the  Ministries  in 

which an update is provided with regard to the
