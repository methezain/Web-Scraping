Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

by  the  Court  of  learned  Additional  District 

Judge, East-Islamabad. 

02. 

Succinctly  stated,  facts  of  the  case 

are  that  respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  for 

recovery  of  maintenance,  dower  and 

recovery of gifts / gold, wherein she stated 

that  marriage  inter  se  the  parties  was 

solemnized  on  22.12.2017,  against  dower 

amount  of  Rs.  403,000/-  in  shape  of  gold 

ornaments. 

The 

petitioner 

ousted 

respondent  No.  1  from  his  house  on 

12.09.2018,  in  three  wearing  apparel  and 

retained  all 

the  dowry  articles,  gold 

ornaments  weighing 

07  Tolas 

and 

educational  documents,  respondent  No.  1 

filed  an  application  before  concerned 

Chairman  Union  Council  for  recovery  of 

dowry  articles  and  on  13.01.2019,  dowry 

articles  were  received  by  her 

in 

the 

presence  of  witnesses,  except  gold 

ornaments given by her parents and others 

and  given  as  dower  by  petitioner.  The  said 

gold  ornaments  were

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

whereas  keys  of  locker  were  with  the 

petitioner,  but  jewelry  boxes  were  found 

lying empty in the locker. The petitioner on 

20.10.2018,  sent  a  notice  of  Talaq to  the 

respondent No. 1 and also conducted Talaq 

proceedings 

before 

Chairman  Union 

Council,  petitioner 

failed 

to  give  due 

maintenance  and  gold  ornaments 

to 

respondent No. 1, hence the suit. 

03.  The  suit  was  contested  by 

the 

petitioner by filing written statement. Issues 

were  framed  and  after  hearing  both  the 

parties 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  / 

Guardian  Judge,  East-Islamabad  partially 

decreed  the  suit  of  the  respondent  No.  1 

vide  impugned  judgment  and  decree  dated 

29.02.2020.  

04.  The  petitioner  filed  an  appeal  which 

was  dismissed  by  the  Court  of  learned

4 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

05. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter alia, contends that both the impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are  erroneous,  not 

tenable  under  the  law;  learned  Judge 

Family  Court  /  Guardian  Judge,  East-

Islamabad  passed  the  impugned  judgment 

and decree on the basis of mis-reading and 

non-reading  of  evidence;  the  petitioner 

produced  sufficient  evidence 

that 

the 

respondent  No.  1  took  her  jewelry  while 

leaving  house  of  the  petitioner  but  learned 

Courts  have  not  appreciated  the  evidence 

produced  by 

the  petitioner;  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are 

against the law, hence are liable to be set-

aside.  

06. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  contesting 

respondent  No.  1  has  controverted  the 

arguments advanced by learned counsel for 

the  petitioner  and  stated  that  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are  passed  strictly 

in  accordance  with 

law  and  evidence 

produced  by  the  parties;  the  petitioner  has 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

taken different stances in written statement 

as  well  as  in  the  affidavit  of  evidence;  the 

petitioner  has  failed  to  establish  during  the 

trial  that  the  respondent  No.  1  has  taken 

the  jewelry  while  leaving  the  house;  there 

are concurrent findings of both the learned 

trial  Courts,  hence  prayed  for  dismissal  of 

instant writ petition.  

07.  Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  learned 

counsel for the respondent No.1 have been 

heard  and  record  has  been  perused  with 

their able assistance.  

08.  The  petitioner  has  taken  different 

stance  in  the  pleadings  as  well  as  in  the 

evidence. 

In  Para-6  of 

the  written 

statement,  he  has  mentioned  that  the 

respondent  No.  1  left  the  house  with  her 

own  free  will  and  wish,  without  any  rhyme 

or reason along with her brother and uncle 

in  his  absence  and  proved  herself  to  be  a 

cruel  and  disobedient  wife  and  also 

mentioned  in  Para-12  that  the  respondent 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

No.  1  took  away  all  the  gold  ornaments, 

documents  and  certificates  along  with  her 

when  she  left  the  house  with  her  brother 

and uncle but in the affidavit of evidence he 

has  taken  a  stance  by  mentioning  that  the 

respondent  No.  1 

left 

the  house  on 

12.09.2018, 

in  presence  of  petitioner, 

without  permission  and  also  took  suitcase 

filled with her belongings and hand box etc. 

along with her. 

09.  The  respondent  No.  1  filed  petition 

before  Union  Council  for  return  of  the 

dower  /  gift  articles, 

the  commission 

appointed  by 

the  Union  Council,  got 

recovered the gifts / dower articles and also 

prepared  the  list  which  is  Mark-A,  wherein 

the suitcases, purse, educational documents 

have  been  mentioned.  The empty  boxes  of 

dower  were  also 

recovered  but 

the 

ornaments were not present in the boxes. 

10.  Different 

stance 

taken  by 

the 

petitioner in the pleadings and the recovery 

of  all  the  dowry  /  gift  articles  from  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

house  of  the  petitioner  by  the  commission 

appointed  by  Union  Council  clearly  prove 

that respondent No. 1 has not taken jewelry 

while leaving the house of the petitioner.  

11. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  in  the 

impugned judgments and decrees. It is well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash a decision for an error of law. It will 

also  be  issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of 

its 

jurisdiction,  or  fails  to 

exercise its jurisdiction or where the Court 

or a tribunal acts illegally in exercise of its 

undoubted  jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principles  of 

natural  justice.  The  High  Court  while 

issuing  a  writ of certiorari  acts in exercise 

of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in  exercise  of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal.  

12. 

In  this  regard,  reliance  is  placed 

upon  following  dictums  /  laws  laid  down 

by the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court of Pakistan: 

 i.  Amjad  Khan  VS  Muhammad 

Irshad  (Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155).  

ii.  President All Pakistan Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and others 

(2020 SCMR 260) 

iii.  Chief  Executive  MEPCO  and 

others  VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others (2019 SCMR 919). 

iv.  Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad 

Usman and others (PLD 2018 SC 28). 

v.  Shajar  Islam  VS  Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 SC 

45). 

13. 

Further, there are concurrent findings 

of  both  the  learned  Courts  below  against 

the  petitioner.  In  case  of  concurrent 

findings  of  the  Courts  below,  scope  of  the 

constitutional petition becomes very limited. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

The  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out  any 

mis-reading or non-reading of the evidence. 

It  has  been  laid  down  in  a  case  titled  as 

Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS Abdul Samad 

through L.Rs. and 2 others (2008 YLR 

2309) that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope of the constitutional petition 

for interference is very limited and 

it can only be interfered when the 

orders  of  the  Courts  below  are 

fanciful or based on misreading or 

non-reading of the evidence". 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  the  cases  titled 

as  Khuda  Bukhsh  VS  Muhammad 

Sharif and another (1974 SCMR 279), 

and  Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad Ali 

and others (PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

14. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  dated 

29.02.2020  &  22.09.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  /  Guardian 

Judge, 

East-Islamabad 

and 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge,  East-Islamabad 

 
 
 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No 3692 of 2021 

respectively, are in accordance with law and 

facts  of  the  matter,  hence  do  not  require 

any interference by this Court. 

15. 

In  view  of  above  prospective,  the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same  is  dismissed,  with  no  order  as  to 

costs.
