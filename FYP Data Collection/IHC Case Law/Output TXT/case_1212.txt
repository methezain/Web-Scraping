Proceedings 
19.07.2021  Mr. Muhammad Ashfaq  Shahid, Advocate  for 

the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  orders  dated 

01.02.2021  and  08.12.2020,  passed  by 

respondents  No.1  and  2 

respectively, 

whereby  interim  maintenance  of  minors  was 

fixed  at  the  rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  each  per 

month  and  also  passed  an  order  regarding 

dowry articles. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  case  has  not  been 

decided by the learned Trial Court according 

to 

law  as 

the 

respondents  have  not 

produced  any  evidence 

regarding 

the 

financial  status  of  the  petitioner  but  the 

maintenance of minors was fixed at the rate 

of  Rs.10,000/-  each  per  month.  Learned 

counsel  further  contends  that  the  petitioner 

is jobless and has produced evidence in this 

regard  which  has  been  exhibited  but  no 

reason  for  grant  of  maintenance  has  been 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
mentioned in the impugned order, hence the 

same is liable to be set-aside.
