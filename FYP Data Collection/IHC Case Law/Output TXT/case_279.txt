has  not  given  sufficient  /  plausible  reasons 

for  partially  allowing  the  dowry  articles 

according to the list of articles produced by

admitted  that  dowry  articles  produced  by 

the petitioner are lying in the house. It has

10. 

It has been laid down in a case titled 

as  Shafique  Sultan  VS  Mst.  Asma 

Firdous and others (2017 SCMR 393), 

that: 

“Husband  denying  that  dowry 

articles were ever given to wife. 

The  list  of  dowry  articles 

provided  by  wife  consisted  of 

articles of daily use which were 

generally given to brides at the 

time of their marriages. The said 

list did not contain any article(s) 

which  may  be  termed  as 

extravagate  or  beyond  the 

financial resources of the wife's 

family. Supreme Court observed 

that  giving  dowry  articles  to 

daughters  was  in  line  with 

custom/tradition  and  practices 

which were deeply rooted in the 

society  and  were  followed  by 

parents of all classes irrespective 

 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 1342 of 2015 

of  their  financial  status.  Held, 

suit  for  recovery  of  dowry 

articles  had  been  rightly 

decreed.” 

Reliance is also placed upon the cases titled 

Muhammad Habib VS Mst. Safia Bibi 

and  others  (2008  SCMR  1584)  and 

Mirza  Arshad  Baig  VS  Additional 

District  Judge  Multan  and  others 

(2005 SCMR 1740).  

11. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

the instant writ petition is allowed and the 

petitioner  is  held  entitled  to  receive  dowry 

articles  mentioned  in  list  (Ex-P/3)  or  in 

alternative recovery of Rs. 4,18,469/-.
