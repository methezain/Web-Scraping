10.02.2022  Ms. Farrah Naz Awan, Advocate for petitioner.  

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

The  instant  writ  petition  is  arising  out  of 

orders  dated  13.07.2021  and  16.12.2021, 

passed by  the  Family Court and the  Additional 

District  Judge,  Islamabad  respectivelywhereby 

plaint in suit for dissolution of marriage on the 

basis  of  ‘khula’  filed  by  the  petitioner  was 

returned  due  to  lack  of  territorial  jurisdiction 

and the appeal was also dismissed.  

2. 

Precisely,  relevant  facts  are  that  on 

24.02.2021  petitioner  filed  suit  for  dissolution 

of  marriage  on  the  basis  of  ‘khula’  against 

respondent No.3 (Muhammad Irfan). The latter, 

in response to notice, entered appearance and 

on  06.04.2021  filed  an  application  for  the 

return  of  plaint  for  its  presentation  before  the 

court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  The  petitioner 

responded  the  said  application  through  a 

written  reply.  The  Family  Court  after  hearing 

arguments returned the plaint to the petitioner 

for 

its  presentation  before  the  court  of 

competent 

jurisdiction  vide  order  dated 

13.07.2021.  The  petitioner  then  preferred  an 

appeal  which  was  dismissed  by  the  Addl. 

District  Judge  Islamabad-West  vide  order 

dated 16.12.2021, hence instant writ petition.

3. 

The  learned  counsel  contended  that  the 

petitioner contracted marriage with respondent 

No.  3  on  22.02.2017;  that  her  father  has 

migrated to Pakistan from Kashmir many years 

ago;  that    after  migration,her  father  served  in 

the  Printing  Cooperation  Of  Pakistan  Press, 

Islamabad,  remained  posted  at  Islamabad  till 

his  death  on  01.11.2012;  that  subsequently 

her brother was offered the job in the Printing 

Press  Cooperation  Of  Pakistanwho 

is  still 

serving in the said department and that  as the 

father  of  the  petitioner  was  a  Pakistani  citizen 

therefore,  petitioner  also  retains  the  same 

status.

5. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Perusal 

of 

record 

reveals 

that 

respondent  No.3  in  his  application  for  the 

return  of  the  plaint  objected  upon  the 

maintainability  of  the  suit  of  the  petitioner 

before  Family  Court  at  Islamabad  on  the 

ground  that  that  both  the  parties  are  subject 

of State of Azad Jammu& Kashmir; that their 

marriage was solemnized and registered over 

there;  that  Azad  Jammu&Kashmir  is  not  a 

Constitutional part of Pakistan and due to the 

same  the  application  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Act, 1964 cannot be extended to Azad 

Jammu & Kashmir and their subjects.  

6. 

Record further reveals that petitioner in 

her 

reply 

to  above  stated  application 

admitted 

the 

facts 

that 

the  marriage 

ceremony  and  the  registration  of  “Nikah 

Nama” took place in the State of Azad Jammu 

& Kashmir, and that she is residing in Family 

Protection 

Rehabilitation 

Center 

I-8, 

Islamabad for the last 5-6 months.

7. 

The 

learned 

Court 

of 

First 

Instance,while  forming  its  view  qua  return  of 

plaint  placed  reliance  upon  a 

reported 

judgment  of  this  Court  in  the  case  of  ‘Majid 

Hussain  v.  Farah  Naz  &  others’  (2017  YLR 

84)wherein  by  referring  Section  14B  of  the 

Pakistan  Citizenship  Act,  1951,  it  was  held 

that the citizens of Azad Jammu &Kashmir do 

not  fall  within  the  definition  of  Citizen  of 

Pakistan.  Para  No.  9  of  the  judgment  is 

reproduced hereunder;- 

Now,  Section  14B  ibid  speaks  of 
“ 
subjects  of  the  ‘State  of  Jammu  and 
Kashmir’and  not  of  subjects  of  citizens 
of Ázad Jammu and Kashmir’. Who the 
subjects  of  the  ‘State  of  Jammu  and 
Kashmir’are  has  been  well-explained 
by  the  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of 
Inam-ul-Haq  v.  Chairman  F.P.S.C, 
Islamabad  (2005)  SCMR  622),  in  the 
following terms;-  

“After  the  partition  of  the  Sub-
Continent  in  the  year  1949,  the  State 
of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  was  forcibly 
occupied  India.  Some  parts of  the  said 
State were, however, got liberated and 
are since called Azad Kashmir Territory 
while  the  remaining  parts  of  the  same 
are  still  under  the  Indian  Occupation. 
Some residents of this Indian occupied 
Kashmir  Migrated  to  Pakistan  and  are 
living in different parts of Pakistan and 
the  Azad  Kashmir  Territory,  marking 
time  to  return  to  their  homeland,  on 
settlement  of  the  Kashmir  dispute. 
their 
These 
descendants,  though  living  in  Pakistan 
and  Azad  Kashmir  appear  to  have 
preferred  to  continue  to  retain  their 
status  as  subjects  of  the  State  of 
Jammu  and  Kashmir  and  their  said 
status  appear  even  to  have  been 
recognized by the State of Pakistan.”

8. 

The  judgment  referred  to  above  guides 

to hold that in order to maintain a suit before 

the  Family  Court  at 

Islamabad, 

it 

is 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
4 

“W.P. NO. 453/2022” 

mandatory  for  the  plaintiff  to  show  that  any 

cause  of  action  has  arisen  within 

the 

territorial limits of Family Court at Islamabad.  

9. 

The 

facts  of  the 

instant  case,  as 

highlighted  above,  lead  to  draw  inference 

that the case of the petitioner lacks essentials 

enumerated  in  the  case  of  Majid  Hussain 

(supra), therefore, the concurrent view of the 

two  courts  below  does  not  call  for  any 

interference.  Consequently,  there 

left  no 

need  to  proceed  further  with  the  instant  writ 

petition  which  is  accordingly  dismissed  in 

limine.
