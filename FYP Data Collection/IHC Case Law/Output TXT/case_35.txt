This 

is  an  application  seeking 

restoration of the instant petition, which was 

dismissed 

for 

non-prosecution 

on 

13.04.2023.  

 2. 

Today,  the  case  was  called  on  its 

turn as well as before rising of the Court, but 

on  both  occasions,  no  one 

tendered 

appearance  on  behalf  of  the  applicant  / 

petitioner.  On  the  last  date  of  hearing  i.e. 

25.09.2023,  brother  of 

the  petitioner 

appeared  and  sought  an  adjournment,  on 

08.06.2023, learned counsel for the applicant 

/ petitioner sought time to prepare the brief, 

on 29.05.2023, no one tendered appearance 

on behalf of the applicant / petitioner.  

 3. 

In  view  of  above  situation,  it 

reveals  that  the  applicant  /  petitioner  is  not 

interested  to  pursue  the  matter.  The  name 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of 

learned  counsel  for  the  applicant  / 

petitioner is reflected in the cause list. There 

is  no  application  for  an  adjournment.  As  the 

matter  pertains  to  the  year  2021,  hence  the 

instant  application  is  dismissed  for  non-

prosecution.
