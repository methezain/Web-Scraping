VS

Mst. Asma Zahid and another. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
11.08.2022  Mr.  Majid  Nadeem  Bhatti,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  challenged  order  dated 

24.09.2021, passed by learned Judge Family 

Court  /  Guardian  Judge,  West-Islamabad, 

whereby  warrant  of  arrest  has  been  issued 

and learned  Trial Court has passed an order 

on the petition for cancellation of warrant of 

arrest, whereby petitioner has been directed 

to  deposit  sum  of  Rs.1,00,000/-  in  lieu  of 

warrant of arrest.  

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that respondent No.1 has 

mentioned  wrong  address  of  the  petitioner 

and  obtained  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree 

by 

committing 

cheating, 

fraud 

and 

misrepresentation  before  the  learned  Trial 

Court,  due  to  which  valuable  rights  of  the 

petitioner  have  been 

jeopardized; 

the 

moment  passing  of  ex-parte  judgment  and 

decree  came  to  the  knowledge  of  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
petitioner,  he  has  filed  petition  for  setting 

aside  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree,  which 

is  still  pending  and  no  order  has  been 

passed; it is evident from Nikahnama as well 

as  from  other  documents  that  respondent 

No.1 has deliberately and willfully mentioned 

wrong  address  of  the  petitioner  in  order  to 

obtain  ex-parte  judgments  and  decrees  in 

both  the  cases,  hence  impugned  order  is 

liable to be set-aside and learned Trial Court 

be  directed 

to  provide  opportunity  of 

producing  the  evidence  and  contesting  the 

cases strictly in accordance with law.   

 3. 

Points  raised,  need  consideration. 

Notice to the respondents.

Re-list on 18.08.2022. 

 C.M. No.01 of 2022. 

Exemption  sought  for  is  allowed 

subject to all just and legal exceptions. 

 C.M. No.02 of 2022. 

Notice.  Meanwhile,  operation  of 

the  impugned  order  is  suspended.  However, 

restraining  order  shall  cease  to  exist  and 

expire  automatically, 

if  not  extended 

specifically on the next date of hearing .
