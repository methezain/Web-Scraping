Date of  order/ 
proceedings 

                                    20.12.2023. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary.  
Raja  Muhammad  Mahtab,  Advocate  for  the 
Petitioner.  
Ch.  Naeem  Ali  Gujjar,  Advocate  for  the 
Respondent No.1. 

1. 

The 

learned  counsel  for 

the  Petitioner 

submits  that  he  needs  time  to  place  on  record 

certain  exhibits,  which  were  produced  before  the 

learned  Trial  Court  but  which  were  not  filed  with 

the  instant  Petition  at  the  time  of  filing.  The 

learned  counsel  for  the  Respondent  No.1  has 

vehemently objected as he is ready to proceed with 

the matter and highlights that the dispute has been 

pending  since  four  years  and  that  the  Petitioner 

was required to place on record the entire record of 

the learned  Trial  Court at  the time of filing of the 

Petition  and  the  request  for  adjournment  today  is 

merely a delaying tactic.  

2. 

In  view  of 

the 

foregoing,  one 

last 

opportunity  is  being  granted  to  the  Petitioner  to 

proceed  with  the  case.  He  may  file  a  C.M  for 

additional  documents  provided  that  they  are  all 

documents,  which  were  produced  in  evidence 

before 

the 

learned  Trial  Court.  No  further 

adjournment  for  any  reason  whatsoever  shall  be 

granted on the next date.  

3. 

Relist on 08.01.2024.
