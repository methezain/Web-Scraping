Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel

01 

28.01.2022  Mr. Imran Feroz, Advocate.   

The  petitioner  prays  for  setting  aside  the  decree 

dated  11.10.2021  and  order  dated  14.01.2022  passed  by 

the  learned  trial  court  and  by  the  learned  appellate  court, 

respectively.  

2 

Learned  counsel  states  that  both  the  orders  ignored 

the  admission  in  the  cross-examination  of  respondent 

No.2 and the entries in the nikahnama whereby the house 

in question was accepted to have been given to her by the 

petitioner.   

3 

He  is  asked  to  satisfy  this  Court  as  to  whether  the 

statement  in  the  nikahnama  to  have  given  the  house  and 

admission  in  the  cross-examination  that  the  house  was 

given to her is tantamount to an actual transfer of title, for 

which  an  appropriate  instrument  of  transfer  is  to  be 

executed 

in  furtherance  of 

the  undertaking 

in 

the 

nikahnama and now the decree, for which he would assist 

this Court on the next date of hearing.  

4 

Let  notice  be 

issued 

to 

the  respondents  for 

16.02.2022.  

Notice.

and legal exceptions.
