    22.11.2021.  Mr. Haroon ur Rasheed, Advocate for  

petitioner.  
Qazi Rehan Shabbir, Advocate for  
respondent No.1.  

The petitioner has impugned order dated 

29.09.2021  pursuant  to  which  the  interim 

meeting  schedule  has  been  provided  pursuant 

to  which  the  petitioner  is  to  meet  her  children 

on  alternate  Saturdays  from  10:00  am  to 

12:00 pm in Court premises. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

submitted  that  he  is  not  seeking  custody  at 

this  stage  but  that  pending  determination  of 

custody  by  the  learned  Guardian  Court,  the 

petitioner 

is 

interested 

in  nurturing  her 

relationship  with  her  children  and  the  time 

provided for meeting her children is not ample 

for  such  purpose.  And  that  Court  premises  is 

not  a  congenial  environment  for  expending 

parenting time. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  has 

submitted  that  the  respondent  has  never 

objected  to  petitioner’s  meeting  with  the 

mother  and  has  voluntarily  afforded  her  the 

opportunity  to  meet  her  children  even  outside 

 
 
 
 
the schedule fixed by the Court. He has further 

submitted 

that  he  has  no  objection 

to 

petitioner’s  meeting  with  her  children  as 

prayed. 

4. 

In  view  of  the  above,  let  order  dated 

29.09.2021 be amended to the extent that the 

respondent  will  drop  the  children  at  the 

residence  of  the  petitioner  at  04:00  pm  every 

Saturday  and  collect  them  from  the  said 

residence  at  04:00  pm  every  Sunday  till  the 

time  that  the  learned  Guardian  Court  decides 

custody petition pending before it. It is clarified 

that  the  minor  children  will  not  be  removed 

from  the  jurisdiction  of  the  learned  Guardian 

Court. 

5. 

The instant petition stands disposed off.
