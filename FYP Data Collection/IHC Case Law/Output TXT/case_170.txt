proceedings  

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

07.02.2023.  Mr  Zahid  Mehboob  Advocate  vice  learned  counsel 

for the Petitioner.  
M/s  Syed  Gohar  Ali  Zaidi  and  Umair  A.Zaidi 
Advocates for the Respondents No. 1 and 2.  

The learned proxy counsel seeks an adjournment on behalf 

of the learned principal counsel for the Petitioner as he is stated 

to be busy before the Honourable Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi 

Bench and further states that the learned principal counsel would 

like to submit written arguments. 

2. 

It is noted that the matter pertains to maintenance of minor 

children  of  the  Petitioner  and  the  Respondent  No.1  and  in  this 

respect a stay suspending execution was passed on 01.03.2021. In 

view  of  the  foregoing  the  request  for  adjournment  is  extremely 

unfortunate  and  cannot  be  entertained  without  vacating  the  stay 

order passed on 01.03.2021. As such the said stay order is hereby 

vacated. 

3. 

Relist on 13.03.2023 on which date the learned counsel for 

the  Petitioner  shall  assist  this  Court  by  making  oral  arguments 

and  in  support  thereof  if he  wishes  to  file  written  arguments he 

may  do  so.    However,  in  case  of  non-appearance  or  request  for 

adjournment  for  any  reason  whatsoever  the  matter  shall  be 

dismissed for non-prosecution.
