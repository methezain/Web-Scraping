Date of 
order/ 
proceeding 
21.10.2021  Mr.  Imran  Zahoor  Mughal,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner.  

The  petitioner  through  the  instant  writ 

petition has called in question the legality and 

validity  of  impugned  judgment  and  decree 

dated  27.04.2021,  passed  by  the  learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Judge  Family  Court) 

West-Islamabad  as  well  as  Judgment  and 

decree  dated  07.09.2021,  passed  by  the 

learned  Additional  District 

Judge,  West-

Islamabad  to  the  extent  of 

issue  No.1, 

whereby  respondent  No.1/plaintiff  was  held 

entitled for recovery of maintenance allowance 

at  the  rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  w.e.f 

May 2017 till expiry of her iddat period.

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

02.  Brief 

facts  of 

the  case  are 

that 

respondent  No.1/plaintiff  filed  suit  against  the 

petitioner 

/  defendant 

for 

recovery  of 

maintenance  allowance  alongwith  dower 

amount  and  dowry  articles  before  the  learned 

Judge Family Court, Islamabad.  

03. 

Petitioner  was  married  with  respondent 

No.1 on 16.06.2011; dower amount was fixed 

as  Rs.  325,000/-  out  of  which  Rs.  25,000/- 

were paid at the time of Nikah  and remaining 

amount  of  Rs.  3,00,000/-  was  payable  on 

demand.  After  Nikah,  Rukhsati  of  respondent 

No.1 took place on the same day. Few months 

after  the  marriage,  relations  between  the 

parties became strain; the petitioner threw out 

respondent  No.1  from  his  house  and  since 

then  neither  the  petitioner  contacted  her  nor 

paid any maintenance allowance / Haq Mehr.  

04. 

Suit  filed  by  respondent  No.1  /  plaintiff 

Mst.  Sana  Siddiq  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance,  dower  amount  and  dowry  articles 

was decreed and respondent No.1/plaintiff was 

held  only  entitled  to  receive  maintenance 

allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per 

 
 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

month w.e.f. May 2017, till expiry of her iddat 

period.  The  amount  paid  by  the  defendant  if 

any,  during  the  said  period  shall  be  deducted 

from  arrears  of  maintenance  allowance  fixed 

by  the  Court.  Suit  filed  by  the  respondent 

No.1/plaintiff  to  the  extent  of  recovery  of 

dower was dismissed.  

05. 

Petitioner  filed  an  appeal  against  the 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.04.2021,  which  was  also  dismissed  by  the 

Court  of  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

West-Islamabad  vide  judgment  and  decree 

dated 07.09.2021.  

06. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia, contends  that  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees passed by learned Judge Family Court 

and  learned  Additional  District  Judge  to  the 

extent of issue No.1 are against law and facts 

of the case; impugned judgments and decrees 

have  been  passed  by  ignoring  the  material 

parts of evidence and are based on conjecture 

and  surmises,  hence  both  are  liable  to  be  set 

aside.

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

07.  Arguments heard, record perused.  

08. 

It  is  admitted  in  the  evidence  produced 

by  the  parties  that  respondent  No.1  was 

married  with  the  petitioner  and  she  was 

thrown  out  by  the  petitioner  in  May,  2017; 

according  to  the  law,  wife  is  entitled  for 

receiving  the  maintenance  from  her  husband; 

respondent 

No.1 

/ 

plaintiff 

claimed 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

35,000/-  per  month  but  keeping  in  view  the 

financial status of the petitioner, learned Judge 

Family  Court  has 

fixed 

the  maintenance 

allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per 

month  w.e.f.  May,  2017  till  expiry  of  iddat 

period of respondent No.1.   

09. 

There  are  concurrent  findings  of  both 

the 

learned  Courts  below  against 

the 

petitioner. In case of concurrent findings of the 

courts  below,  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner 

has failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading of evidence. It has been laid down in a 

case titled as “Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS Abdul 

 
 
 
 
  
5 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others” (2008 

YLR 2309)” that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

interfered when  the  orders  of 

the Courts below are fanciful or 

based  on  misreading  or  non-

reading  of  the  evidence".  The 

same  view  has  also  been  taken  in  a 

case 

titled  as  “Sadruddin  VS 

Aslam  Madad  Ali  and  others” 

(PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

10. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is  only 

available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of 

law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for  correcting 

errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court 

or  a  tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise 

its  jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts 

illegally 

in  exercise  of 

its 

undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice. The High Court while issuing a writ of 

certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of  supervisory  and 

 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

not  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in 

exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not review 

the  findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal. Reliance may be made to 

the following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan VS Muhammad Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle of law that the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the  discretion  exercised 

by lower courts unless the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has been passed without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of evidence, or is not in 

accordance with the law. 

 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

If none of these errors is 

present, the High Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

a different conclusion as 

to  the  controversy  than 

the latter. In this regard, 

reference can be made to 

a  collective  reading  of 

Mst.  Mobin  Fatima  v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad  (1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"President  All  Pakistan 

Women 

Association, 

Peshawar 

Cantt 

VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and 

others” (2020 SCMR 260),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It  is  settled  law  that 

when the Statute does not 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

same 

cannot 

be 

challenged  by  invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction  of  the  High 

Court in order to gain a 

similar objective. Where a 

Statute  has  expressly 

barred a remedy which is 

not  available  to  a  party 

under  the  Statute,  it 

cannot 

be 

sought 

indirectly by resort to the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of  the  High  Court.  The 

High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

advancing  the  policy  of 

law  and  delivering 

expeditious  justice  in 

accordance with the law 

and the Constitution. Even 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and  discretionary 

in 

nature and should not be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass the purpose of a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"Where the Court or the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such 

determination 

cannot  ordinarily  be 

interfered  with  by  the 

High 

Court  while 

exercising 

jurisdiction 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution."  

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate  court  / 

Tribunal in a fair and just 

manner without violating 

or  disregarding  statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned  Judges  of  the 

High  Court  for  future 

course of action:  

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz 

Ahmed  v.  Government 

of  Pakistan,  through 

Secretary, 

Interior 

Division, 

Islamabad 

(1994 SCMR 2142). 

(ii)  Shahnaz Begum v. 

The Hon’ble Judges of 

the High Court of Sindh 

and  Balochistan  (PLD 

1971 SC 677). 

 
 
11 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

(iii)  Malik Shaukat Ali 

Dogar v. Ghulam Qasim 

Khan  Khakwani  (PLD 

1994 SC 281).  

 (v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam  VS  Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 

2007 SC 45),  it  is  held  by  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The  High  Court  in 

exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

is  not  supposed  to 

interfere  in  the  findings 

on  the  controversial 

question of facts based on 

evidence  even  if  such 

finding is erroneous. The 

scope  of  the  judicial 

review of the High Court 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution in such cases, 

is limited to the extent of 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence  or  if  the 

finding  is  based  on  no 

evidence which may cause 

miscarriage of justice but 

it  is  not  proper  for  the 

High Court to disturb the 

finding  of  fact  through 

reappraisal of evidence in 

 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No. 3730 of 2021 

writ 

jurisdiction  or 

exercise  this  jurisdiction 

as a substitute of revision 

or appeal”. 

11. 

For what has been discussed above, the 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

27.04.2021,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court-West,  Islamabad  as  well  as 

Judgment  and  decree  dated  07.09.2021, 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District 

Judge, West-Islamabad are in accordance with 

law and facts of the matter and do not require 

interference  by  this  Court.  The  writ  petition  is 

not maintainable, hence dismissed in limine 

being meritless.
