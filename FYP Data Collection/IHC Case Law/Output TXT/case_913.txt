Proceedings 
15.12.2021  Syed Sadaqat Ali, Advocate for the petitioner, 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary. 

Ms.  Sana  Pervaiz  Mir,  Advocate  for  respondent 
No.1. 

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner, Sadeem-ur- Rehman, impugns the order 

dated  23.06.2021  passed  by  the  Court  of  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad 

whereby  his  appeal  against  the  judgment  and 

decree  dated  20.04.2021  passed  by  the  Court  of 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court,  was  dismissed 

primarily on the ground of limitation. The judgment 

and  decree  was  passed  on  20.04.2021,  whereas 

the  appeal  against  the  said  judgment  and  decree 

was  filed  on  22.06.2021  after  the  delay  of  one 

month and two days.  

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for  the  petitioner  has 

brought  on  record  notification  dated  30.09.2021 

issued by this Court according to which the period 

between  24.03.2020  to  30.09.2021  was  to  be 

condoned  in  terms  of  Section  12  of  the  Limitation 

Act, 1908 (“the 1908 Act”). 

3. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

respondent  No.1 

submitted  that  since  the  petitioner’s  appeal  was 

admittedly barred  by  one month and  two days, the 

learned  Appellate  Court  did  not  commit  any 

illegality by dismissing his appeal on the ground of 

limitation. 

4. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  contesting  parties  and  have 

perused the record with their able assistance. 

5. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with 

the  lockdown  policy  of  the  Federal  Government, 

 
                
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
this  Court,  vide  office  order  No.181/IHC/2020, 

dated  24.03.2020,  directed  that  owing  to  the  then 

prevailing  emergency  situation  in  the  country,  the 

period  of  limitation  prescribed  by  laws  for  filing 

appeals  /  petitions  etc.  in  this  Court  as  well  as  in 

the  Civil  and  District  Courts,  Islamabad  shall  be 

deemed  to  be  condoned  and  the  Courts  shall  be 

presumed  to  be  closed  during  the  period  in  the 

public  interest,  within  the  meaning  of  Section  4  of 

the  1908  Act.  Since  the  Federal  Government  lifted 

certain restrictions earlier imposed by it, this Court 

directed 

that 

the  said  office  order  dated 

24.03.2020  shall  cease 

to  have  effect 

from 

30.09.2021  and  the  period  from  24.03.2020  to 

30.09.2021  shall  be  excluded  for  the  purpose  of 

computing  the  limitation  in  terms  of  Section  12  of 

the  1908  Act  for  filing  of  any  suit,  petition  and 

appeal.  

6. 

In the case at hand, the limitation for filing an 

appeal  against  the  judgment  and  decree  dated 

20.04.2021  passed  by  the 

learned  Civil  Court 

expired on 20.05.2021. The appeal was filed by the 

petitioner on 22.06.2021. Since the period of delay 

with  which  the  appeal  was  filed  was  after  the 

issuance of  the said  office  order dated  24.03.2020 

and  before 

its  recall  vide  notification  dated 

30.09.2021,  the  delay  with  which  the  appeal  was 

filed stood condoned.  

7. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  petition  is 

allowed;  the  impugned  order  dated  23.06.2021 

passed by the learned Appellate Court is set-aside; 

and  the  matter 

is  remanded  to  the 

learned 

Appellate Court to decide the appeal on merits.
