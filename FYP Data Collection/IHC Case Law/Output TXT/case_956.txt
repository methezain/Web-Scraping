4 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

instant writ petition has been filed.  

09.  Learned counsel for the petitioner inter 

alia contends that the petitioner is doing job 

in bykea rider to meet day to day expenses 

and  is  unable  to  pay  maintenance  to  the 

minor  as  directed  by  learned  Judge  Family 

Court;  learned  Trial  Court  fixed  a  huge 

amount  of  Rs.  20,000/-  as 

interim 

maintenance 

of 

the  minor  without 

considering  the 

financial  status  of  the 

petitioner;  the  impugned  orders  are  based 

upon  surmises  and  conjectures  and  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  has  not  applied  his 

judicial  mind  while  deciding  the  application; 

the  impugned  orders  of  learned  Trial  Court 

are  against  the  law  and  facts;  learned  Trial 

Court  has  failed  to  appreciate  the  principle 

of  natural 

justice  while  passing 

the 

impugned  order  and  has  prayed 

for 

modifying  and  setting  aside  the  impugned 

orders  dated  09.11.2020  and  22.01.2021, 

respectively.  

10.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

11. 

It  is  mentioned  in  Section  14(3)  of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 

that:  

“No appeal or revision shall lie against 

an interim order passed by a Family 

Court.” 

12. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 

President  All  Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt  VS 

Muhammad  Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020 SCMR 260), that: 

“It  is  settled  law  that  when  the 

Statute does not provide the right of 

appeal against certain orders, the 

same  cannot  be  challenged  by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction  of  the  High  Court  in 

order  to  gain  a  similar  objective. 

Where  a  Statute  has  expressly 

barred  a  remedy  which  is  not 

available  to  a  party  under  the 

Statute,  it  cannot  be  sought 

indirectly  by  resort  to  the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  the 

High  Court.  The  High  Courts 

exercising constitutional jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant  and 

conscious of this Rule and strictly 

adhere to the same in the interest of 

advancing  the  policy  of  law  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

delivering  expeditious  justice  in 

accordance with  the  law  and  the 

Constitution.  Even  otherwise, 

constitutional 

jurisdiction 

is 

equitable  and  discretionary  in 

nature and should not be exercised 

to defeat or bypass the purpose of a 

validly enacted statutory provision.” 

(Emphasis supplied) 

13. 

In  another  case 

titled  as  Chief 

Executive  MEPCO  and  others  VS 

Muhammad  Fazil  and  others  (2019 

SCMR 919),  the Hon’ble Supreme Court of 

Pakistan has held that:  

“Where the Court or the Tribunal has 

jurisdiction  and  it  determines 

specific question of fact or even of 

law, unless patent legal defect or 

material irregularity is pointed out, 

such 

determination 

cannot 

ordinarily be interfered with by the 

High  Court  while  exercising 

jurisdiction under Article 199 of the 

Constitution.” 

14. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme Court of Pakistan in a case titled as 

Chairman, NAB VS Muhammad Usman 

and others (PLD 2018 SC 28), that: 

“The  powers  of  judicial  review 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

vested in High Court under Article 

199 of the Constitution is no doubt 

a  great  weapon  in  the  Judge’s 

hands however, the same shall not 

be  exercised  in  a  case  where 

discretion  is  exercised  by  the 

subordinate court/Tribunal in a fair 

and just manner without violating 

or disregarding statutory provision 

of law, likely to occasion the failure 

of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary jurisdiction shall not 

be  exercised  at  random  and  in 

routine manner. The following case 

law is reproduced for the guidance 

of the learned Judges of the High 

Court for future course of action:   

(i)   

Brig  (Rtd.)  Imtiaz 

Ahmed  v.  Government  of 

Pakistan, through Secretary, 

Interior Division, Islamabad 

(1994 SCMR 2142). 

(ii)  

Shahnaz  Begum  v. 

The  Hon’ble  Judges  of  the 

High  Court  of  Sindh  and 

Balochistan  (PLD  1971  SC 

677). 

(iii)  Malik  Shaukat  Ali 

Dogar v. Ghulam Qasim Khan 

Khakwani  (PLD  1994  SC 

281).  

15.  Reference  in  this  regard  may  also  be 

made to the following case laws:  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

(i) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case 

titled as Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi 

VS Province of Sindh (1996 SCMR 

1165), that: 

“The statute excluding a right 

of  appeal  from  the  interim 

order  cannot  be  passed  by 

bringing  under  attack  such 

interim 

orders 

in 

Constitutional jurisdiction. The 

party affected has to wait till it 

matures into a final order and 

then to attack it in the proper 

exclusive  forum  created  for 

the purpose of examining such 

orders.” 

(ii) 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case 

titled  as  Mumtaz  Hussain  alias 

Butta VS Chief Administrator of 

Auqaf, Punjab (1976 SCMR 450), 

that: 

“As  the  said  Ordinance  has 

taken  away  the  right  of 

petitioner  to  interim  relief, 

learned  counsel  submitted 

that this was a ground which 

entitled  the  petitioner  to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 4314 of 2021 

prosecute  a  writ  petitioner 

despite the pendency of the 

proceedings  on  the  District 

Court.  The  argument  is 

misconceived because the writ 

jurisdiction  of  the  superior 

Courts cannot be invoked in 

aid of injustice and in order to 

defeat the express provisions 

of the statutory law.” 

16.  Learned  counsel  for  the petitioner  has 

failed to point out as to how the impugned / 

interim  orders  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court  were  the  consequence  of  an 

error  of  law  or  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess of jurisdiction.  

17. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective, 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
