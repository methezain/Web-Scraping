             08-01-2021.  Malik  Shahid  Mehmood  Kandwal,  Advocate  for 

the petitioner.      

  The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  divorce 

certificate  dated  03.12.2020 

issued  by 

respondent  No.1  under  section  7(3)  of  the 

Muslim  Family 

Laws  Ordinance,  1961 

(“Ordinance”)  in  the  name  of  his  daughter 

Hina Akram pursuant to notice received from 

respondent No.3 on 08.05.2017.  

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submits  that  the  petitioner’s  daughter  and 

respondent  No.3  reside  in  United  Kingdom, 

they  are  separated  but  they  are  not  divorced 

and  proceedings 

regarding  custody  and 

maintenance  of  their  children  are  pending  in 

the  family  Court  of  Watford,  U.K;  that  divorce 

certificate  has  been  issued  after  a  delay  of 

three  and  a  half  year  from  initiation  of 

proceedings  before  respondent  No.1  and  in 

breach  of  section  7(1)  of  the  Ordinance;  that 

the  petitioner’s  daughter  and  respondent 

No.3’s  wife  who  resides  in  U.K  has  never 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                      2                               W.P No. 21 of 2021 

received  any  notice  section  7(1)  of  the 

Ordinance 

the  contravention  of  which 

is 

punishable for a term of up to one year under 

section  7(2)  of  the  Ordinance;  that  non-

compliance  with  mandatory 

conditions 

prescribed  in  the  Ordinance  is  a  fraud  on  the 

statute  and  in  breach  of  fundamental  rights  of 

the  petitioner’s  daughter  who  is  respondent 

No.3’s  wife;  that  the  impugned  certificate 

issued  without  compliance  of  mandatory 

conditions  prescribed  under  the  Ordinance  is 

void  ab-initio  and  of  no  legal  effect;  that  the 

petitioner’s  daughter  is  unable  to  travel  to 

Pakistan due to Covid-19 and is also unable to 

issue  a  power  of  attorney  certified  by  the 

Pakistan  High  Commission  due  to  lockdown 

currently  enforced  in  U.K;  given  that  the 

impugned  certificate  can  be  abused  by 

respondent  No.3  to  undermine  valuable  rights 

of the petitioner’s daughter this Court ought to 

exercise  its  equitable  jurisdiction  to  hear  this 

matter, especially as the petitioner is father of 

respondent  No.3’s  wife  and  neither  has  any 

monetary  interest  in  the  matter  nor  any 

interest  adverse  to  his  daughter/respondent 

No.3’s  wife.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

submits  that  the  fact  that  the  Petitioner’s 

daughter/Respondent 

No.3’s 

wife 

has 

authorized  the  petitioner  to  file  the  instant 

petition  can  be  verified  by  the  Court  through 

                                                      3                               W.P No. 21 of 2021 

video-conference.  The  learned  counsel  relies 

on  “Mubarik  Ali  Shah  and  4  others  VS  Chief 

Administrative  Auqaf”  [1988  CLC  348]  and 

“Mrs. 

Ambreen  Naseem 

Khawaja 

VS 

Federation  of  Pakistan  and  others”  [2015 

P.Cr.L.J  506]  on  the  issue  of  maintainability. 

The  learned  counsel  further  relies  on  “Syed 

Wajiha Haris VS Chairman Union Council No.7, 

Lahore”  [2010  MLD  989],  “Mst.  Sana  Asim 

Hafeez VS Administrator/Chairman, Arbitration 

and  Conciliation  Court”  [2016  MLD  1061]  and 

“Mst.  Asma  Bibi  VS  Chairman  Reconciliation 

Committee and others” [PLD 2020 Lahore 679] 

wherein  the  learned  Lahore  High  Court  has 

held 

that  under  SRO  1086(K)61  dated 

09.11.1961, officers of Pakistan Mission abroad 

are  authorized  to  discharge  the  functions  of 

Chairman  under  the  Muslim  Family  Laws 

Ordinance, 1961 and reconciliation proceedings 

ought  to  be  undertaken  at  the  place  of 

residence of nonresident Pakistanis.        

3. 

 I  am  inclined  to  issue  notice  to  the 

respondents  and  determine  the  issue  of 

maintainability with their assistance. Office is 

directed  issue  notices  to  respondent  Nos.  1 

and  3  for  18.01.2021.  The  matter  will  be 

taken up at 2.00 pm.

special  messenger  as  well  as  courier  service 

at the petitioner’s cost to be deposited within 

                                                      4                               W.P No. 21 of 2021 

three  days.    Respondent  No.1  shall  ensure 

that  Record  Keeper  of  the  said  Arbitration 

Council appears in person on the next date of 

hearing  along  with  the  entire  record  of  case 

No.  228/2017 

in  which 

the 

impugned 

certificate has been issued.   

5.  Learned  counsel  for  the  parties  shall 

assist 

this  Court 

on 

the 

issue 

of 

maintainability  of 

this  petition  and 

the 

mandatory  requirements  and  pre-requisites 

for  the  issuance  of  divorce  certificate  under 

section 7 of the Ordinance in cases where one 

or both of the spouses are residing abroad at 

the  time  of  initiation  of  divorce  proceedings 

under the Ordinance.  

6.  The  petitioner  shall  place  on  record  any 

power  of  attorney  issued  to  him  by  his 

daughter  Hina  Akram,  received  by  email, 

along  with  cover  email  before  or  after  the 

institution  of  the  instant  petition,  even  if  not 

signed  by  witnesses  and  certified  by 

Pakistan’s  High  Commission  in  UK.  Learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  shall  also  move  an 

application  requesting  the  office  to  make 

arrangements  for  a  skype  call  for  the  next 

hearing, pursuant to the e-court facility made 

available 

to  petitioners, 

to  enable 

the 

petitioner’s  daughter  to  confirm  to  the 

satisfaction of this court that the petition has 

been filed pursuant to her instruction and she 

                                                      5                               W.P No. 21 of 2021 

has  been  unable  to  formally  issue  a  certified 

power of attorney to the petitioner due to the 

lockdown  in  United  Kingdom  amid  Covid-19. 

The  petitioner  shall  ensure  that  his  daughter 

is  available  for  the  skype  call  on  the  next 

date of hearing.    

C.M No. 01 of 2021.
