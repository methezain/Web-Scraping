Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessary. 

Mr. Umar Hanif Khichi, Advocate along with petitioner. 
Ch. Naeem Ali Gujjar, Advocate for respondent. 

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  of  the  judgement  and  decree  dated 

20.11.2020 passed by the Additional District Judge, Islamabad, enhancing the 

family  maintenance  awarded  by  the  learned  Family  Court  vide  its  judgement 

and  decree  dated  10.10.2019  from  Rs.4,000/-  to  Rs.5,000/-  per  month  from 

05.05.2015  till  the  date  of  decree,  and  from  that  date  onwards,  a  sum  of 

Rs.8,000/-  per  month  with  increments,  instead  of  Rs.6,000/-  awarded  by  the 

learned trial Court.  

2 

I have gone through the two judgments and do not find any error of law 

therein.   

3 

On  facts,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  states  that  the  Appellate 

Court  misread  the  evidence  in  finding  that  the  petitioner’s  husband,  a 

government  servant,  was  earning  Rs.40,000/-  per  month  as  property  income, 

whereas para 20 of the judgement of the learned Family Court records that the 

petitioner receives  Rs.14,000/- as house rent allowance.  The former sum, he 

argues, is not proven by any document on record.  The latter sum, he concedes 

per  the  Family  Court’s  judgement,  is  in  addition  to  the  petitioner’s  salary.   

The  latter  sum  is  therefore  to  be  factored  in  awarding  maintenance.    The 

former  sum  can  be  ignored.    The  award  of  Rs.8,000/-  per  month  as 

maintenance,  enhancing  it  from  Rs.6,000/-,  is  by  no  means  an  improper 

exercise of judicial discretion in this case.   

4 

Sitting  in  Constitutional  jurisdiction,  I  am  not  meant  to  reappraise  the 

evidence to take a different view arrived at by the family courts.  Even if the 

‘rental-sum error’ pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner husband 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

is accepted to be correct, but taking into account the petitioner’s official rent 

allowance, the amounts awarded by the Family Court and enhanced by a small 

percentage  by  the  Additional  District  Court  are  not  shown  to  be  against  any 

legal  rules  on  calculation  of  maintenance,  nor  a  misapplication  of  the 

jurisdiction vested in them.   

5 

In respect of para 11 of the judgement of the learned Additional District 

Judge,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  after  consultation  with  his  client 

stated  that  his  client  requests  for  the  said  amount  to  be  paid  in  instalments.  

With the accrued sum being a multiple of about 6-8 times his proven income, 

the  request  is  allowed,  and  he  is  allowed  to  pay  the  accrued  sum  from 

05.05.2015 till 10.10.2019 per the said para 11 in 6 instalments, payable by the 

10th of each month, the first instalment falling due in November, 2022.  The 

petitioner is directed to make all other payments, and commence the payments 

of  monthly  allowance,  per  the  Appellate  Court’s  judgement  within  30  days 

from today.
