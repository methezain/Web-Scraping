The  petitioner  (Nawab  Khan S/o  Rowail Khan) 

seeks  bail after arrest  in the  case  F. I. R  No. 08 dated 

06.01.2018, under Sections 395, 412,  170, 171  & 457 

P.P.C, 

registered  with  Police  Station  Tarnol, 

Islamabad. 

2. 

Precisely,  prosecution  case 

is 

that  on 

07.03.2019, 

the 

petitioner 

along  with 

his 

co-accused  allegedly committed  dacoity  at the  house 

of the complainant. 

3. 

The  petitioner  moved  bail  application  before 

the 

learned  Judicial  Magistrate  Section  30, 

Islamabad-  West,  which  was  dismissed  vide  order 

dated  10.04.2020. Thereafter,  he  moved  bail petition 

before the  learned Additional  Sessions Judge (West), 

Islamabad,  which  was  also  dismissed  vide  order 

dated 21.05.2020, hence, the instant petition. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended 

that the  petitioner  has not committed  any offence  but 

has been falsely  involved  in the  instant  case; that  no 

identification parade of the petitioner was held; that no 

recovery  has  been  effected  from  the  petitioner;  that 

the 

investigation  has  been  completed  and 

the 

petitioner  is  no  more  required  to  the  police.  Lastly, 

prayed for grant of bail.

5. 

Conversely, learned  State  counsel vehemently 

opposed  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned 

counsel  for  petitioner  contending  that  there  is  no 

malafide  on  the  part  of  complainant  to  involve  the 

petitioner  in  the  present case.  Further contended that 

the  petitioner  is  also  involved  in  F.l.R  No.30/2018 

under Section 395  P.P.C, registered at  Police Station 

Shams  Colony and  F.l.R  No.246/2017  under Section 

395,  412,  P.P.C  registered  at  Police  Station  Noon, 

Islamabad, therefore, he is  not entitled for the grant of 

post arrest bail. 

6. 

7. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Briefly, the story narrated by the complainant is 

that  on  05.01.2018  at  about  3.00  a.m.  he along with 

his  family  members  was  sleeping  in  his  house;  that 

five unknown accused persons entered into his house 

and informed him that they are employees of Rangers 

and they  have to search his house.  It  is  further stated 

that during the search, they took  away 4-1 /2 tola gold 

ornaments,  Rs.50,000/-  cash;  that  their  age  was 

between  30/40  years  of  age  and 

that  he  can 

recognize them if they come before him. 

8. 

Perusal  of 

the 

record 

reveals 

that  no 

identification  parade  has  been  conducted  during  the 

course of investigation to identify the real culprits, that 

nothing has been recovered from the petitioner during 

the course of investigation, which, prima  facie, makes 

the case one of further  inquiry in  terms  of section 497 

Cr.P.C.  Deeper  appreciation  of  evidence 

is  not 

permissible  at  bail  stage.  No  purpose  would  be 

served  to  the  prosecution  if  the  accused  remains 

behind the bars for an indefinite period.  It  is  important 

to  mention 

that  bail  cannot  be  withheld  as  a 

punishment. There  is  no legal or moral compulsion to 

keep  people  in  jail  merely on  the  allegation  that  they 

have  committed  offences  punishable  with  death  or 

transportation,  unless  reasonable  grounds  appear  to 

exist 

to  disclose 

their  complicity.  The  ultimate 

3 

on.  Misc.  No. 813-B/2020 

conviction  and  incarceration  of  a  guilty  person  can 

repair  the  wrong  caused  by  a  mistaken  relief  of  bail 

granted  to  him,  but  no satisfactory  reparation  can  be 

offered 

to  an 

innocent  man. 

for  his  unjustified 

incarceration  at  any  stage  of  the  case  albeit  his 

acquittal  in  the  long  run.  Reliance  in  this  regard  is 

placed  upon the  cases  reported  as  "Manzoor  and  4- 

others  VS  The  State"  (PLO  1972  Supreme  Court 

81),  and  "Muhammad  Shafique  and  another  VS

The State and others" (2017  S C  M  R 79). 

9. 

So  far  as  the  contention  of  the  learned  State 

counsel  that  similar  nature  of  cases  have  already 

been  registered  against  the  petitioner  is  concerned, 

there  is  no  previous  record  of  the  petitioner  to  have 

been  convicted,  as  such,  he  cannot  be  treated  as 

hardened  criminal  and  it  cannot  be  a  ground  to 

withhold  the  concession  of  bail.  Reliance  in  this 

regard  is  placed  upon  the  case  reported  as  "Bahar 

Hussain  VS 

The  State  and  another'  (2020  SCMR 

871)  wherein it  has been held as under:- 

As  far  as  the  contention  of  learned  Law 
Officer that the petitioner is  involved in  six 
other criminal cases  would not disentitle him 
from  the  relief  sought  for  as  learned  Law 
Officer frankly conceded that petitioner has 
not  been  convicted  in  any  case,  hence, 
mere  involvement in  criminal  cases  could 
not be a  ground to withhold the concession 
of bail in the given circumstances. Reliance 
in this regard is placed upon cases  titled as 
"Moundar and  others  v.  The  State"  (PLO 
1990 SC 934) and  "Muhammad Rafique v. 
The State" (1997 SCMR 412) 

10. 

For  the  forgoing  reasons,  instant  petition  is 

allowed  and  petitioner  is  admitted  to  post  arrest bail 

subject  to  his  furnishing  bail  bond  in  the  sum  of  Rs. 

1,50,000  (Rupees  one  lac  fifty  thousand  only)  with 

one surety in  the like amount to the satisfaction of the 

learned Trial Court.

It 

is  needless 

to  mention  here 

that 

the 

observations  made  hereinabove  are 

tentative 

in 

nature and shall not design to influence the trial.
