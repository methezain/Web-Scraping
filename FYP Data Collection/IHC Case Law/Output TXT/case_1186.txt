Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

Shaukat Ali. 
VS
Additional District Judge (West), Islamabad and 04 others. 

S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
06.08.2021  Ms. Neeli Khan, Advocate for the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed 

judgments  and 

decrees  dated  08.07.2021  and  08.10.2020, 

passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

(MCAC)-West, Islamabad  and learned  Senior 

Civil  Judge-III  (Judge  Family  Court)  West-

Islamabad respectively, whereby appeal filed 

by the petitioner was dismissed and suit filed 

by respondents No.3 to 5 was decreed.    

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia, contends that respondent No.3 has 

neither  produced  any  evidence  nor  any 

receipt  regarding  purchase  of  the  dowry 

articles  mentioned 

in 

the 

list.  Learned 

counsel  further  contends  that  the  amount 

mentioned  against  the  dowry  articles  is  not 

according to the financial status of petitioner 

as  his  family  could  not  afford  to  give  the 

huge  dowry  articles  to  respondent  No.3, 

hence, the impugned judgments/decrees are 

liable  to  be  set  aside.  Learned  counsel  has 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
placed  reliance  on  cases  reported  as  “Azra 

Bibi  VS  Lateef  and  others”  (2020  YLR 

282), “Mst. Samreen Bibi VS Judge Family 

Court and others” (PLD 2015 Lahore 504) 

and  “Mst.  Mirrat  Manzoor  Bajwa  VS 

Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  and 

another” (PLD 2013 Islamabad 11).
