2. 

Report  and  parawise  comments  were  called  from 

the respondents vide order dated: 06.02.2020. The same 

has been received. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that 

the  CNIC of the  petitioner was expired  and the  petitioner 

applied  for  reissuance  of  CNIC  vide  Token  No.7, 

Tracking 

ID  No.504771027474  but 

the  NADRA 

is 

reluctant to  issue the  same  without  any justification  and 

also  blocked  the  same;  that  the  entire  family  of  the 

petitioner is  citizens of  Pakistan and  residing  in  Kashmir 

but the  respondents have  refused to  unblock the  CNICs 

of  the  petitioner  and  his  family  on  the  ground  that  the 

petitioner is  not eligible to hold CNICs, as such, theÂ· act of 

the  respondents  is  clearly  against  the  mandate  of 'the 

constitutional rights provided by the  State; that due to the 

blockage  of 

the  CNIC  of 

the  petitioner,  all 

the 

correspondence  inter-se  the  petitioner  as  well  as  other 

departments has been ceased illegally and with  malafide 

intention.  He  further  contended  that  the  act  of  the 

respondents  is  against  the  principle  of  natural  justice; 

that  no  evidence  is  available  with  the  respondents  to 

declare the petitioner and his family as Afghan Refugees. 

4. 

Conversely, 

learned  AAG  submits 

that 

the 

petitioner  applied 

for 

issuance  of  CNIC  vide  TIO 

No.504771027474  and  the  concerned  officer  of  the 

NADRA  recommended  for  verification  of  particulars  of 

the  petitioner  through  Government  Agency  i.e  l.B,  vide 

letter  dated  02.12.2015  and 

it  was 

reported 

that 

petitioner's  family  is  Afghan  National,  as  such,  a  show 

cause notice under Section  18  of the  NADRA Ordinance, 

2000  was  served  to  the  petitioner  and  his  family  to 

appear  before the  NADRA Verification  Board along with 

all documents,  but he failed  to  do  so,  as such,  he is  not 

entitled  for  any  discretionary  relief  and  this  petition  is 

liable to be dismissed. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

Perusal  of  the  record  reveals  that  the  petitioner 

applied for issuance of CNIC vide TIO No.504771027474 

as 

their  previous  CNICs  were  expired. 

It 

further 

3 

W.P.  N0.361/2020 

transpires  from  the  record  that  the  NADRA  officer 

recommended  the  case  of  the  petitioner  and  his  family 

for  verification  of  their  particulars  through  Government 

Agency  vide  letter  dated  02.12.2015  and  after  due 

verification  it  was  reported  that  petitioner's  family  is 

Afghan  National.  Thereafter,  on  18.07.2017,  a  show 

cause  notice was  issued to  the  petitioner  and  his family, 

under  Section  18  of 

the  National  Database  and 

Registration Authority  Ordinance,  2000 to  appear  before 

the  NADRA Verification  Board along with  all documents, 

but he did  not appear. Record further shows that father of 

the  petitioner  earlier  filed  a  Writ  Petition  No.3760/2016 

before  this  Court,  whereby  the  CNICs  of  the  petitioner 

family  were  temporarily  restored  but  their  case  was 

forwarded  to  the  Zonal  Office  Mirpur  in  the  light  of 

Notification  dated 

19.04.2017.  Despite 

repeated 

telephonic  calls, 

the  petitioner 

failed 

to 

join 

the 

proceedings  before  the  said  Board  for  redressal  of  his 

grievance. 

7. 

Furthermore,  under  Section  18  of  the  National 

Database  and  Registration  Authority  Ordinance,  2000, 

the  petitioner has alternate remedy of appeal against the 

final  order  of  the  respondents  before  the  Federal 

Government  but  the  petitioner  has  not  availed  the  said 

remedy.  When  confronted  with  the  above  alternate 

remedy available to the  petitioner,  at this stage,  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits  that  he  would  be 

satisfied  if  a  direction  is  issued  to  the  respondents  to 

provide an  opportunity of hearing to the  petitioner at their 

Zonal Office, Mirpur. 

8. 

The  request  of  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

seems to be justified. Therefore, the petitioner is  directed 

to  appear  before  respondents  at  their  Zonal  Office 

Mirpur,  within  two  weeks  from  today,  along  with  all  the 

relevant  documents  and  copy  of 

this  order, 

the 

respondents  shall  hear  the  petitioner  and  decide  the 

matter  preferably  within  a  period  of  one  month  after 

receipt of this order.
