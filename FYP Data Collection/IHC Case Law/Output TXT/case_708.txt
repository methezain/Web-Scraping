for 

Petitioner. 
Mr.  Rabi  Bin Tariq, State  Counsel. 
Syed Haider  Ali Shah,  A.S.I., C.I.A,  Islamabad. 
Mr.  M.  Abdullah  Awan,  Advocate 
Complainant. 

for 

Through  the  instant  petition, 

the  Petitioner 

(Misbaullah) 

is  seeking  post-arrest  bail  in  FIR 

No.80/2020  dated  20.02.2020 

registered  for  the 

offences  under  Sections  395/412,  PPC  with  Police 

Station  Sihala, 

Islamabad. 

Initially,  FIR  was 

registered  under  Section  392,  PPC,  however, 

subsequently  vide.  Zimni  No.13  dated  10.07 .2020 

same  was  exchanged  with  Section  395,  PPC. 

Section  412,  PPC  was  added 

thereafter  on 

15.07.2020  through  Zimni  No.17. 

2.  Brief  facts,  as  per  the  FIR,  are  that  the 

Complainant  practices  as  Hakeem  and  his  clinic 

is  adjacent  to  his  house;  that  on  20.02.2020  at 

about  01.00  pm  a  person  aged  about  50  to  55 

years  entered 

into  his  clinic  purportedly 

for 

checkup; 

that 

in 

the  meantime 

three  other 

persons,  armed  with  pistol,  entered  his  clinic  and 

covered  the  face  of the  Complainant  with  a  cloth 

and  forcibly  dragged  him  into  his  house;  that  he 

along  with  his  family  was  confined 

to  a  room 

with  one  person  standing  guard  while  the  other 

2 

Crl.  Misc.  5112022 

three unknown persons searched the cupboards in 

various rooms of the house: that they snatched the 

jewelry  which  his  wife  was  wearing  at  the  time 

worth  10  to las;  they  also  threatened  to  kill  the 

Complainant's  son;  upon their failure to open the 

locker, the Complainant  opened it and gave them 

all  the  jewelry,  which  was  kept  in  the  locker 

along with cash ofRs.400,000/-,  hence the FIR. 

3.  Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended 

that the Petitioner  was not nominated  in the FIR; 

that  his  name  was  added  by  way  of 

supplementary statement which  does not disclose 

source  of information  and  as  such  no  sanctity  is 

attached  thereto  in  law;  that  there  are  material 

discrepancies  between 

the  physical 

features 

described  in  the  FIR  and  that  of the  Petitioner; 

that the FIR was registered initially under Section 

392,  PPC  as  the  Complainant  had  accused  four 

persons 

for  committing 

the  crime  whereas 

Section  395,  PPC  (which  pertains  to  more  than 

five  persons)  was  added  later  without  source  of 

information;  and  that  identification  parade  was 

required 

to  be  conducted  within  21  days, 

however,  in  this  case  it  was  conducted  after 

delay of four months. 

4. 

It  was  further  contended  on  behalf  of  the 

Petitioner  that  he  was  arrested  on  22.03.2020; 

that 

interim  challan  has  been  submitted  on 

01.08.2020;  Petitioner  is  previously  non  convict 

and no  more required  for further  investigation as 

charge  has  been  framed  on  26. l 0.2020;  that 

despite framing of charge the prosecution  is using 

delaying  tactics  before  the  learned  trial  Court  in 

concluding  the  trial,  therefore,  the  Petitioner  is 

3 

Crl.  Misc.  5112022 

entitled  to  bail  on  statutory  ground  as  envisaged 

in  proviso  of  Section  497(l)(a)  Cr.P.C.  Learned 

counsel  has  relied  upon 

the  judgments 

titled 

"Qurban  Ali  VS  The  State  and  others,  2017 

SCMR  2 79"  and  Mian  Sohail  Ahmed  VS  The 

State 2019 SCMR 956. 

5.  Conversely, 

the 

learned  State  Counsel  as 

well  as  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Complainant 

have  strongly  opposed 

this  bail  petition  and 

submitted 

that 

there 

is 

sufficient 

evidence 

available  on  record  to  connect  the  Petitioner  with 

the  commission  of  offence  and  the  offence  falls 

within 

the  prohibitory  clause  of  Section  497 

Cr.P.C.;  that  the  Petitioner's  'havalati  ticket'  was 

found  from  the  place  of  occurrence; 

recovery 

was  affected  on  the  identification  of the  Petitioner 

who  is the  main  accused  and  that  the  Petitioner  is 

prior  convict,  however,  his  previous  conviction  is 

from  Karachi  and  as  such  not  on  record;  further 

that  he  is  also  implicated 

in  FIR  No.92/2016 

registered 

in  the  District  Attock  under  Section 

392,  PPC  which  is on record. 

6. 

It  was  contended 

that 

fifth  person  was 

identified  by  Complainant's  neighbor  by  way  of a 

statement  on  the  same  day  and  that  the  difference 

in  description  of  features 

is  marginal  which  is 

attributable  to  mistake  of judgment  on  account  of 

traumatic  conditions.  Both  the  learned  counsel 

argued 

that  the  Petitioner  was  not  entitled 

to 

statutory  bail  as  the  delay 

in  proceedings 

is 

attributable 

to 

the  Petitioner 

himself.  Even 

otherwise 

the  Petitioner 

is  a  hardened 

and 

desperate  criminal  and  as  such  not  entitled  to 

statutory  bail. 

4 

Crl.  Misc.  51 /2022 

7.  Arguments heard. Record perused. 

8.  The record shows that a 'havalati  ticket'  was 

allegedly  dropped  by  the  Petitioner  at  the  place 

of occurrence  of the  alleged  crime;  that  during 

investigation  of  the  Petitioner,  gold  ornaments 

weighing  3 

tola  and  Rs.  100,000/-  were 

recovered  on  his  identification;  and  that  the 

Complainant 

identified  the  Petitioner 

in  the 

identification  parade. 

Identification  of 

the 

Petitioner  coupled  with  recovery  of  stolen 

property  and  recovery  of incriminating  evidence 

at 

the  crime  scene,  prima 

facie  provides 

sufficient  connection  of the  Petitioner  with  the 

alleged  offence  under  Section  392,  PPC  which 

carries  punishment  of  up  to  ten  years  thereby 

bringing  it  within  the  ambit  of  the  prohibitory 

clause of 497, Cr.P.C. 

9.  With  regard  to  the  Petitioner's  claim  on 

account  of  statutory  bail,  it  is  noted  that  the 

Petitioner  was  arrested  on  22.03.2020  therefore, 

statutory period  of one year  has  lapsed  since his 

detention.  Despite 

framing  of  charge  on 

26. l 0.2020 trial has not been concluded. Before I 

consider  whether  the  delay  is  attributable  to  the 

Petitioner/ Accused  or  not,  I  will  consider  the 

contention  of the  learned  State  counsel  that  the 

Petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  bail  on  statutory 

ground  on  account  of  being  a  hardened  and 

desperate criminal. 

10.  The  record  does  not  reflect  any  pnor 

conviction.  However,  the  record  does  reveal 

three  prior  FIRs  namely,  FIR  No.  92/2016 dated 

21.03.2016  under  Sections  392/411  PPC,  FIR 

5 

Cr!.  Misc.  51 /2022 

No.  37/20  dated  14.01.2020  under  Section  395 

PPC and FIR No.  117/20 dated 22.03.2020 under 

Section A.O.  13/20/65, wherein  the  Petitioner  is 

implicated.  The  first  two  are  for  the  same 

offences as in the instant case i.e., under Sections 

392/411, PPC and 395, PPC and in both FIRs the 

allegation was  of armed robbery.  The third FIR 

was  under  Sections  13/20/65  of  the  Pakistan 

Arms  Ordinance,  1965  for  possession  of  arms 

without license. 

11.  The question  arises  whether  involvement  in 

other  criminal  cases  is  sufficient  to  consider  the 

accused  person 

"hardened,  desperate  or 

dangerous  criminal"  so  as  to  disentitle  him  to 

bail  on  statutory  ground  particularly 

in  the 

absence  of a prior  conviction  as  described  in the 

fourth proviso to Section 497, Cr.P.C. 

12.  The  Honorable  Supreme  Court  in  the  case 

reported  as  Sher  Ali  alias  Sheri  VS The 

State,  1998 SCMR  190  expounded  on  the  issue 

as fo1lows: 

"As regards  the  category  of the accused 
mentioned in fourth proviso,  it will not be 
out  of  context  to  refer  to  the  case  of 
Moundar  and  others  v.  The  State  (P LD 
1990 SC  934),  in which  a  Full  Bench  of 
this  Court  comprising  the  then  learned 
Chief Justice and four companion Judges 
(the  author  of  the judgment  was  Zaffar 
Hussain  Mirza,  J.),  very  succinctly 
enunciated  the  import  of  the  aforesaid 
fourth proviso  as follows:-- 

"It  is  quite  plain  that  the  normal  rule 
stipulated  in  the  third proviso  to section 
497  was  that  an  under  trial  prisoner 
shall  be  released  after  expiry  of  the 
trial 
the 
respective  period,  without 
in 
is 
concluding.  The  fourth  proviso 

6 

Cr!.  Misc.  51/2022 

in 

the 

substance  an  exception  to  the  aforesaid 
general  rule  contained 
third 
proviso.  Before  the  Court  applies  the 
exceptional  provisions  of  the  fourth 
proviso,  it has to form  an opinion that the 
accused  was  a  previous  convict  or  a 
criminal  of  one  of 
the  categories 
described  therein.  The words are  'in the 
opinion  of  the  Court'.  Such  opinion 
cannot  be  obviously  subjective  but  must 
be  based  upon  materials  placed  before 
the  Court,  reasonably  supporting  the 
conclusion that the person  concerned is a 
criminal  of  the  classes  described.  The 
word  'criminal' has not  been  defined. It 
will  not  be proper  and  indeed  would  be 
difficult  to  define  it  or  give  it  a  specific 
meaning. However,  it  is  a  common  word 
of  the  English  language.  According  to 
the Shorter  Oxford Dictionary  the  word 
carries  several  meanings,  including  the 
meaning -- a person accused o{a  crime. 
In  the  context  of  the  provisions  under 
construction,  we  feel 
the  word 
cannot  be  construed 
in  the  technical 
sense,  namely,  that  a formal  accusation 
must  be made  against  the person  or that 
he should have been adjudged guilty of a 
charge  in  a  Court  of law.  It  appears  to 
have  been  used  in  the sense  of a person 
who  violates  the  law  of  the  land.  The 
three  adjectives  qualifying  the  word  ' 
criminal' may also be examined. 

that 

According  to  the  same  dictionary  the 
word  "harden" has been defined to mean, 
inter alia,  (1)  to render or make hard,·  to 
indurate, (2)  to embolden, confirm  (3)  'to 
make  callous  or  unfeeling  and  (4)  to 
make persistent  or  obdurate  in  a  course 
of  action  or  state  of  mind.  The  word 
'hardened' has also been defined  to mean 
'made hard'  indurate;  rendered  callous,· 
hard-hearted;  obdurately  determined  in 
a course". 

'  desperate' 

The same dictionary gives the meaning of 
in 
the  word 
relation  to person:  driven  to desperation 
hence  reckless,  violent,  ready.  to  risk  or 
do anything. 

inter  alia, 

7 

Cr!.  Misc.  51/2022 

The same dictionary gives  the meaning of 
the  word 
'dangerous',  inter  alia,  as 
fraught  with  danger  or  risk,·  perilous, 
hazardous, unsafe.  " 

or 

desperate 

12.  We  are  in respectful  agreement with  the 
above  enunciation  of  law.  We  are  also 
inclined  to  hold  that  in  order  to  bring  an 
accused  person  within  the  compass  of  a 
dangerous 
hardened,, 
criminal  it  is  not  necessarv  to)  prove  that 
he  had  been  previouslv  convicted  for  the 
reason  that  previously  convicted  persons 
are  separately  dealt  with  in  the  above 
fourth  proviso  as 
is  evident.  It  must, 
therefore,  (ollow  that  if  the  prosecution 
places  on  record  sufficient  material  before 
the  Court  to  indicate  that  on  the  basis  of 
tentative  assessment  the  accused  person 
involved  can  be  treated  as  a  hardened,· 
desperate  or  dangerous  criminal  or  a 
person  involved  in  terrorism,  the  bail  on 
the  ground  of  statutorv  de/av  can  be 
denied. "  [Emphasis  added]. 

13.  The  above  case  was  cited  and  followed  by 

the  Honorable  Sindh  High  Court  in  the  case  of 

The  State  through  Assistant  Collector  of  Customs 

VS Ghulam  Mustafa,  2016 YLR  1526, wherein 

it  was  held 

that 

the  criminal 

record  of  the 

'accused'  was  not  the  only  factor  which  could 

exclude  him  from  the  exceptions  contained  in the 

fourth  proviso  of  Section  497,  Cr.P.C.,  "but  the 

'offence', 

impact 

thereof  and  manner  of 

committing thereof is also to be kept in view". 

14.  The  foregoing  cases  make  it  apparent  that 

absence 

of  a  pnor 

conviction 

does 

not 

automatically  exclude  an  accused  person  from  the 

ambit  of  a  "hardened,  desperate  or  dangerous 

criminal" 

for 

there 

is  a  separate 

category 

provided 

in 

the 

fourth  proviso 

for  convicts. 

8 

Crl.  Misc.  51 /2022 

Equating a 'convict'  with a  "hardened, desperate 

or  dangerous  criminal"  would  make  the  latter 

category  redundant.  To  sum  up,  a  hardened, 

desperate  or  dangerous  criminal  may  not 

necessarily be a prior convict. 

15.  In 

the  case  of  a  previously  convicted 

offender  for an offence punishable  with  death  or 

life imprisonment, the exclusion  from the  benefit 

of statutory bail is not discretionary.  On the other 

hand,  the  second  limb  of  the  fourth  proviso 

carves  our  further  categories  of accused  persons 

who  may  be  denied  statutory  bail  provided  the 

Court  forms  an  opinion  that  they  meet  the 

stipulated conditions. Such opinion must be based 

on  the  material  before  the  Court  as  per  the 

pronouncement  of the Honorable  Supreme Court 

in the case of Sher Ali alias Sheri (Supra). 

16. 

I  now  seek  to  examine  the  material  on  the 

record  in  light  of  the  principles  enunciated  in 

cases discussed above in order to form an opinion 

whether  the  Petitioner  can  be  treated  as  a 

hardened,  desperate  or  dangerous  criminal 

bearing  in mind that the  term  'criminal'  includes 

a person accused of a crime as held in the case of 

Sher Ali alias Sheri (Supra). 

1 7.  As  discussed  herein  above,  the  Petitioner 

has  been  accused  of armed  robbery  in two  other 

criminal  matters  apart  from  the  FIR  involved  in 

the instant case and is  also accused  of possessing 

unlicensed  weapons  in  a  third  case. 

In  such 

circumstances,  the  tentative  assessment  of  this 

9 

Crl.  Misc.  51 /2022 

Court  is  that  the  Petitioner  has  been  accused  of 

crimes  which  have  been  carried  out  in a  violent, 

callous, reckless, dangerous and perilous manner. 

Based  on  the  foregoing,  and  relying  upon  the 

definitions  of the  relevant  terms  provided  in the 

case of Sher Ali alias Sheri  (Supra), this Court is 

of the opinion that the Petitioner  can be treated as 

a hardened, desperate and dangerous criminal and 

as such not entitled to bail on statutory grounds. 

18.  For  what  has  been  discussed  above,  there  is 

no  need  to  consider  whether  the  delay  in trial  is 

attributable to the Petitioner or not. 

19.  The  case  of Qurban Ali  (Supra)  relied  upon 

by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  rs 

distinguishable  as  it  was  specifically  noted  m 

such case that no overt act during the occurrence 

was  attributed  to  the  petitioner  in  such  case  and 

as such the case was of further inquiry.  Whereas 

in the  instant case there  is  sufficient  evidence to 

connect the Petitioner with the alleged offence as 

discussed  in  detail  herein  above.  As  far as  the 

case of Mian Sohail Ahmed  (Supra) is concerned, 

the  same  is  not  relevant  as  it  was  not  a  bail 

matter  and  a  deeper  appreciation  of evidence  is 

not permissible at this stage. 

20.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  Petitioner  is 

entitled to speedy disposal of the trial. Therefore, 

the learned Trial Court is  directed to conclude the 

trial  within  four  months  from  the  date  of  this 

order. 

10 

Crl.  Misc.  51/2022 

21.  For  the  forgoing  reasons,  the  instant  bail 

application is dismissed. 

22.  Needless 

to  mention 

that 

the  above 

observations are tentative in nature, which shall in 

no way prejudice the learned trial court.
