and 

This  petition  has  been  filed  for  recovery  of  alleged 

abductee  (Nimra  Bibi),  from  the  illegal  custody  of respondents 

No.  1  to  3. 

02. 

Pursuant 

to  notice,  the  respondents  No. 

I 

to  3  put 

appearance  alongwith  alleged  abductee,  who  was  sent  to  Dar- 

ul-Aman  on  two  occasions  vide  orders  dated  24.08.2020  and 

27.08.2020,  respectively. 

03. 

Today, 

the  detenu/Nimra  Bibi  has  been  produced 

before  this  Court  from  Dar-ul-Aman  who  has  been  interviewed 

by  this  Court  and  her  statement  has  also  been  recorded 

to 

consider  her  willingness,  which 

reveals 

that 

the  age  of 

minor/Nimra  Bibi 

is  16  years  and  05  months 

(D.O.B. 

01.04.2004).  At  present, 

it  appears 

that  there 

is  a  dispute 

between  petitioner 

(real  mother  of  detenu/Nimra  Bibi)  and 

Respondent  No.  21Mehmooda  Bibi,  maternal  grandmother 

(Nani)  of the  alleged  minor/Nimra  Bibi,  who  is presently  living 

in  Karachi  and  present  before  this  court.  The  minor  was  sent  to 

2 

W.P.  No. 2196/2020 

Dar-ul-Aman on two different occasions  in order  to obtain her 

free will even the parties were directed to meet with the alleged 

abductee for her counseling. There is no denial that the alleged 

Nimra Bibi is sui Juris. 

04. 

Nimra  Bibi  (detenu)  categorically  stated  before  this 

court  that  she  intends  to  live  with  her  maternal  grandmother 

(Nani) and requests that  she may be  allowed  to  go to  Karachi 

with  her  grandmother  (Mehmooda  Bibi/Respondent  No.  2) 

instead  of  her  mother  i.e. the  petitioner,  she  has  also  referred 

certain instances due to which she is not comfortable  and feels 

insecure while living with her mother. 

05. 

In  view  of 

the  above 

referred  situation  and 

circumstances, Mehmooda Bibi/respondent No. 2 is directed to 

submit  undertaking that  she will  take  care  of Nimra  Bibi  and 

will  also  be  responsible  for  her  safety,  protection  and  other 

obligations  by  all  means.  At  this  stage  respondent  No.  3  Mr. 

Abid, real uncle  (Mamoo) who is also present  before the Court 

is  directed  to  submit  his  undertaking  to  provide  the  due 

protection,  safety  to  Nimra  Bibi  at  Karachi.  The  needful  has 

been done. 

06. 

Law  officer,  Family  Protection  and  Rehabilitation 

centre,  Mio  Human  Rights  has  also  been  consulted  in  this 

situation  who  contends  that  in  Islamabad  Capital  Territory 

shelter homes are available to provide shelter to family/women 

who  are  willing to  live there,  whereas,  the  minors  have to  be 

taken care in the child protection centers  separately. However, 

she  states  that  if  Nimra  Bibi  is  not  willing  to  go  with  either 

party,  Shelter  Home can  provide  due protection  to  her  during 

her stay. 

07. 

In  view  of above,  there  is  no  need  to  transfer  Nimra 

Bibi  to  Dar-ul-Aman  or  Shelter  Home,  as  she  has  already 

3 

W.P.  No. 2196/2020 

expressed  her  willingness,  hence, 

instant  W .P. 

stands 

dismissed.  The alleged detenu Nimra  Bibi  is at  liberty to  stay 

with her maternal Grandmother  (Nani) and Uncle  (Mamoo) i.e. 

respondent  No.  2  &  3,  respectively.  Both  the  respondents 

(Mehmooda  Bibi/maternal  Grandmother 

(Nani) 

and 

Abid/ Mamoo)  are directed to provide due protection  to Nimra 

Bibi in all respect while living at Karachi.
