Date of

proceeding 
24.06.2022  Mr.  Waqar  Haider  Shah,  Advocate  for  the 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and 
that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessary. 

petitioner. 

The  petitioner  has  filed  the  instant 

writ  petition  under  Article  199  of  the 

Constitution  of 

Islamic  Republic  of 

Pakistan,  1973,  by  assailing  the  impugned 

order dated 24.02.2022, passed by learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge), 

West-Islamabad,  whereby  right  of  cross-

examination of petitioner was closed at the 

cost of Rs. 10,000/-. 

02.  Succinctly stated facts of the case are 

that  the  respondent  No.  1  filed  a  suit  for 

recovery of maintenance allowance, dower, 

gold  ornaments  and  dowry  articles, 

petitioner 

filed  written  statement  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

issues were framed. The respondent No. 1 

appeared  along  with  her  witness  but  no 

one  turned  up  on  behalf  of  petitioner,  so 

his  right  of  cross-examination  was  closed 

by learned Senior Civil Judge-III (Guardian 

Judge), West-Islamabad, at the cost of Rs. 

10,000/-  vide 

impugned  order  dated 

24.02.2022.  

03.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter alia, contends that law always favours 

adjudication 

on  merit 

rather 

than 

technicalities; it is a fundamental and legal 

right of the petitioner to cross-examine the 

witness  produced  by  respondent  No.  1; 

valuable rights of the petitioner have been 

jeopardized,  as  learned  trial  Court  cannot 

render 

just  and 

fair  decision  without 

providing  opportunity  of  cross-examination 

to the petitioner.  

04.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

05.  The family suit was filed in the Court 

of  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge  /  Family 

Judge, West-Islamabad on 31.10.2020. On 

16.12.2020,  counsel 

for  the  petitioner 

 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

appeared  and  submitted  his  Vakalatnama 

and the case was adjourned for submission 

of  written  statement  on  11.01.2021. 

Thereafter  almost  nine  (09)  opportunities 

were  provided 

to 

the  petitioner 

for 

submission  of  written  statement  but  the 

petitioner  delayed  the  matter  on  one 

pretext  or  the  other.  Costs  were  imposed, 

last and final opportunity was provided and 

finally the petitioner was proceeded against 

ex-parte on 08.06.2021.  

06.  Learned 

Senior  Civil 

Judge-III 

(Guardian 

Judge), 

West-Islamabad 

recorded  ex-parte  evidence  of  respondent 

No.  1  along  with  her  witness  as  PW-1  & 

PW-2 on 29.06.2021. 

07.  Petitioner  moved  a  petition 

for 

setting 

aside 

ex-parte  order  dated 

08.06.2021,  which  was  allowed  on 

26.07.2021, subject to cost of Rs. 1,000/-. 

Thereafter  the  case  was  adjourned  for 

07.09.2021 

for  submission  of  written 

statement.  On  07.09.2021,  the  case  was 

adjourned for 15.09.2021 for submission of 

 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

written  statement  with 

last  and 

final 

opportunity.  On 

15.09.2021  written 

statement  was  not  filed  and  the  case  was 

adjourned 

for  28.09.2021,  again  on 

28.09.2021 written statement was not filed 

and 

the 

case  was 

adjourned 

for 

09.10.2021. 

08.  On 09.10.2021 written statement was 

not  filed  and  lastly  the  petitioner  had  filed 

written  statement  on  12.10.2021  i.e.  after 

more than 10 months of his appearance in 

the family suit. 

09. 

Issues  were  framed  on  16.11.2021 

and  the  case  was  adjourned  for  recording 

of evidence of respondent No. 1 / wife. On 

30.11.2021, 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

respondent No. 1 gave statement that she 

will  rely  on  ex-parte  evidence  already 

recorded  on  29.06.2021  and  the  case  was 

adjourned 

for  09.12.2021 

for  cross-

examination  on  witnesses  of  respondent 

No.  1.  On  08.01.2022  respondent  No.  1 

along  with  her  witness  was  present  but 

associate  of 

learned  counsel 

for 

the 

 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

petitioner  was 

requested 

for 

an 

adjournment.  Again 

on 

09.02.2022, 

respondent  No.  1  /  wife  of  the  petitioner 

along  with  her  witness  appeared  but  no 

one  appeared  on  behalf  of  petitioner  / 

defendant and the case was adjourned for 

24.02.2022 for cross-examination. Learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge), 

West-Islamabad  has  mentioned  that  if  the 

cross  examination  is  not  conducted  on 

24.02.2022,  right  to  cross-examine  will  be 

closed. 

10.  On  24.02.2022,  respondent  No.  1    / 

wife  of  the  petitioner  along  with  witness 

was present, the case was called time and 

again  but  no  one  turned  up  on  behalf  of 

petitioner,  hence 

the 

right  of  cross-

examination  of  petitioner  /  defendant  was 

closed  at  the  cost  of  Rs.  10,000/-  and  the 

case  was  adjourned  for  the  petitioner  / 

defendant’s evidence.  

11.  The  above  mentioned  facts  clearly 

show  that  the  petitioner  /  defendant  was 

deliberately  delaying  the  matter  on  one 

 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

pretext  or  the  other,  respondent  No.  1  / 

wife  appeared  in  the  trial  Court  on  many 

dates for recording of her evidence as well 

as 

for  cross-examination  but 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  neither  cross-

examined  respondent  No.  1  nor  her 

witness.  

12.  This  conduct  clearly  shows  that  the 

petitioner is trying to cause inconvenience, 

insult  and  embarrassment  to  respondent 

No.  1.  According  to  the  contents  of plaint, 

respondent  No.  1  is  still  his  wife,  the 

petitioner  has  contracted 

the  second 

marriage and is delaying the matter just to 

give her mental torture.   

13. 

In  Civil  Procedure  Code,  1908, 

prescribed 

time 

for 

filing  of  written 

statement  is  provided  as  thirty  (30)  days 

and  the  consequences  of  not  filing  of 

written  statement  within  stipulated  period 

of  time  is  provided  in  Order  VIII  Rule  10 

C.P.C. 

14. 

In 

the 

instant 

case  many 

opportunities  were  provided 

to 

the 

 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

petitioner for conducting cross-examination 

upon  the  respondent  No.  1  and  her 

witness.  The  August  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan 

in  a  case 

titled  as  Moon 

Enterpriser CNG Station, Rawalpindi 

VS  Suit  Northern  Gas  Pipelines 

Limited,  through  General  Manager, 

Rawalpindi and another (2020 SCMR 

300), while dealing with a similar question 

of  law  pertaining  to  application  of  Order 

XVII  Rule  3  C.P.C  has,  in  unequivocal 

terms, held that: 

"In our view it is important for the 

purpose  of  maintaining  the 

confidence of the litigants in the 

court systems and the presiding 

officers 

that  where 

last 

opportunity to produce evidence is 

granted and the party has been 

warned of the consequences, the 

court  must  enforce  its  order 

unfailingly  and  unscrupulously 

without  exception.  Such  order 

would in our opinion not only put 

the  system  back  on  track  and 

reaffirm the majesty of the law but 

also put a check on the trend of 

seeking multiple adjournments on 

frivolous grounds to prolong and 

 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

delay  proceedings  without  any 

valid  or  legitimate  rhyme  or 

reason.  Where  the  Court  has 

passed an order granting the last 

opportunity, it has not only passed 

a judicial order but also made a 

promise to the parties to the lis 

that no further adjournments will 

be  granted  for  any  reason.  The 

Court must enforce its order and 

honour  its  promise.  There  is 

absolutely no room or choice to do 

anything else. The order to close 

the right to produce evidence must 

automatically  follow  failure  to 

produce  evidence  despite  last 

opportunity  coupled  with  a 

warning.  The  trend  of  granting 

(Akhri Mouqa) then (Qatai Akhri 

Mouqa)  and  then  (Qatai  Qatai 

Akhri Mouqa) make a mockery of 

the provisions of law and those 

responsible  to  interpret  and 

implement it. Such practices must 

be  discontinued, 

forthwith”. 

(Emphasis supplied) 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  a  case  titled  as 

Rana Tanveer Khan VS Naseer Ud Din 

and other (2015 SCMR 1401). 

15. 

It  is  mentioned  in  Section  14(3)  of 

the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 

that:  

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

“No  appeal  or  revision  shall  lie 

against an interim order passed by 

a Family Court.” 

16. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled 

as  Syed  Saghir  Ahmad  Naqvi  VS 

Province of Sindh (1996 SCMR 1165), 

that:  

The  statute  excluding  a  right  of 

appeal  from  the  interim  order 

cannot be passed by bringing under 

attack  such  interim  orders  in 

Constitutional  jurisdiction.  The 

party affected has to wait till it 

matures into a final order and then 

to attack it in the proper exclusive 

forum created for the purpose of 

examining such orders.” 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  cases  reported 

as  1976 SCMR 450 and 2020 SCMR 

260. 

17. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is 

only  available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an 

error  of  law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for 

correcting  errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an 

inferior  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction, 

or  fails  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  or 

 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

where the Court or a tribunal acts illegally 

in  exercise  of  its  undoubted  jurisdiction 

and it decides a matter in violation of the 

principle  of  natural  justice.  The  High 

Court while issuing a writ of certiorari acts 

in  exercise  of  supervisory  and  not 

appellate  jurisdiction.  Reliance  is  placed 

on the following case laws:  

i.  Amjad Khan VS Muhammad 

Irshad  (Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155). 

ii.  President  All  Pakistan 

Women  Association,  Peshawar 

Cantt VS Muhammad Akbar Awan 

and others (2020 SCMR 260). 

iii.  Chief  Executive  MEPCO  and 

others  VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others (2019 SCMR 919). 

iv.  Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and  others 

(PLD 2018 SC 28).  

v.  Syed Saghir Ahmad Naqvi VS 

Province  of  Sindh  (1996  SCMR 

1165). 

vi.  Mumtaz Hussain  alias Butta 

VS Chief Administrator of Auqaf, 

Punjab (1976 SCMR 450). 

 
 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No. 2370 of 2022 

18.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  as  to  how  the 

impugned  order  dated  24.02.2022,  passed 

by learned Senior Civil Judge-III (Guardian 

Judge),  West-Islamabad 

was 

the 

consequence of  an  error of  law  or  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. 

19. 

In  view  of  the  above  prospective, 

instant  writ petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is dismissed in limine.
