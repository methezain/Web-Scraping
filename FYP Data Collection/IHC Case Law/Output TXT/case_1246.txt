Date of

Proceedings 
24.06.2021  Mr. Zaheer Ali, Advocate for the petitioner. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  by  an  order 

dated 11.06.2021, whereby an appeal against 

the order of the learned Guardian Judge, who 

has  afforded  the  right  to  the  minorâ€™s  father/ 

respondent  No.1  to  meet  his  son  twice  in  a 

month for seven hours, was dismissed. 

2. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

states  that  the  grant  of  seven  hours  to  the 

father  to  meet  the  minor  child  is  excessive 

and needs to be curtailed.  

3. 

It  is  unfortunate  that  the  parents  of  the 

minor child are unable  to agree to a schedule 

of  visitation  in  the  interest  of  the  minor  child 

which  can  be  best  served  if  he  benefits  from 

the care and affection of both his parents. Be 

that  as  it  may,  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  has failed to point out  any  illegality 

in  the  impugned  order  and  consequently  the 

instant petition is dismissed in limine.
