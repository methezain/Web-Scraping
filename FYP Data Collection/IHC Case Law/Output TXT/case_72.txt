Learned  counselâ€™s  submission  is  simply  that  the  language  in  the 

nikahnama  is  that  the  house  had  already  been  given,  meaning  that  yet  another 

house  was  not  to  be  given,  and  therefore  a  decree  could  not  be  executed  for  a 

second house.  He is directed to file an affidavit on the next date of hearing with 

the particulars of the house that he claims to have already been given along with 

its title documents in favour of the wife.
