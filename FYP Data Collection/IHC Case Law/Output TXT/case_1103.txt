Order with signature of Judge, and that  of parties 
or counsel, where necessary. 

11-10-2021  Barrister  Waqas Aziz Qureshi,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner. 
Rana Imran  Farooq,  A.A.G. 
M/s  Mehmood Ahmed  Khan,  Bushra  Abbas and  M 
Bilal,  Advocate  for  respondent  no.5. 

The  petitioner  has  invoked  the  jurisdiction 

of 

this  Court  under  Article 

199  of 

the 

Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan, 

1973  because  he  asserts  that  his  children  were 

allegedly  removed  from  the  jurisdiction  of  the 

competent  court  at  the  United  Arab  Emirates 

with 

the  connivance  of 

the  officials  of 

the 

Embassy of  Pakistan. 

2. 

The  learned  counsels  have  informed  that 

litigation  between  the  parties 

is  also  pending 

before  a 

learned  court  at  Rawalpindi.  The 

allegations 

and  assertions  made 

in 

the 

memorandum  of  the  petition  relate  to  alleged 

misconduct  on  part  of 

the  officials  of 

the 

Pakistan  Embassy  at  the  United  Arab  Emirates. 

'  The  controlling  Ministry  i.e.  Ministry  of  Foreign 

Affairs  is, therefore,  the  proper  forum  for  raising 

the  grievances  described  in  the  petition.  The 

petitioner, 

therefore, 

if  so  advised,  will  be  at 

liberty 

to 

file  a 

representation  before 

the 

Secretary,  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs.  In  case 

such  a  representation 

is  filed  then  this  Court 

expects 

that 

the 

latter  will  consider 

the 

grievances  of  the  petitioner  and  proceed  in 

accordance with  law. 

3. 

The petition  is  accordingly  dis~osed of.
