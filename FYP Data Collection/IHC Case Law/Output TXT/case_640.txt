SAMAN RAFAT IMTIAZ, J.    

Through  the  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner 

has  assailed  the  Judgment  dated  15.12.2021  passed  by  the  learned  Additional 

District Judge-I, Islamabad (East) as well as ex-parte Judgment and Decree dated 

24.02.2021  and  Order  dated  23.10.2021  passed  by  the  learned  Judge,  Family 

Court, Islamabad (East).  

2. 

Facts, in brief, are that the Petitioner and the Respondent No.1 were married 

on 14.05.2000. The parties were blessed with four children (Respondents Nos. 4 to 

7). The relations between the husband and wife deteriorated and Respondents No.3 

to 7/Plaintiffs instituted a suit for recovery of maintenance allowance and monthly 

rent  of  House  at  the  rate  of  8,000/-  against  the  Petitioner/Defendant.  The 

Petitioner/Defendant was  summoned  by  the  learned Trial  Court  through  ordinary 

as  well  as  substitute  mode  i.e.  publication  in  newspaper,  but  no  one  entered 

appearance  on  his  behalf,  hence,  an  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree  was  passed  in 

favor  of  Respondents  No.  3  to  7/Plaintiffs  on  24.02.2021.    Respondents  No.3  to 

7/Plaintiffs  then  filed  execution  petition  before  the  learned  Trial  Court  on 

17.06.2021 and the learned Trial Court after issuance of notice proceeded to issue 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P a g e  | 2 
W.P.No. 134/2022 

warrant  of  arrest  of  present  Petitioner/Defendant  who  was  arrested  and  produced 

before the Court.  

3. 

On  28.09.2021  Petitioner/Defendant  filed  application  for  setting  aside  ex-

parte  judgment/decree  before  the  learned  Trial  Court  mainly  on  the  ground  that 

both  the  parties  are  permanent  residents  of  Azad  Jammu  &  Kashmir;  that  their 

marriage was solemnized  and  registered in  District  Plandri, AJ & K; and that no 

cause of action has accrued in Pakistan, therefore, the learned Family Court lacked 

jurisdiction to entertain the Respondents No.3 to 7/Plaintiffs’ suit. Further, that no 

summons  or  notices  were 

issued  upon 

the  Petitioner/Defendant  as 

the 

Respondent/Plaintiff mentioned wrong address of the Petitioner/Defendant in order 

to  obtain  ex-parte  decree.  The  Petitioner/Defendant  submitted  that  he  is  a 

conductor  by  profession  and  as  such  comes  to  Rawalpindi/Islamabad  with  the 

vehicle.  He  claimed  that  on  25-09-2021,  the  Respondent/Plaintiff  called  him  to 

come to Ali Pur, Islamabad to meet the children and that he was arrested when he 

reached. The Petitioner/Defendant’s application was allowed vide Impugned Order 

dated 23.10.2021 subject to deposit of 50% of the decretal amount within 30 days.  

4. 

However, the Petitioner/Defendant filed appeal before the learned Appellate 

Court  on  22.11.2021.  The  appeal  was  dismissed  vide  Impugned  Judgment  dated 

15.12.2021 inter alia, due to the fact that the order dated 26-02-2020 records that 

as per report of process server, the Defendant refused to receive notice, hence the 

instant  Petition.  The  proceedings  in  the  execution  petition  were  still  pending  till 

filing of instant writ petition on 13.01.2022.  

5. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  Petitioner  contended 

that 

the 

Impugned 

Judgments/Order passed by the learned Courts below are not tenable as no cause of 

action  has  accrued  in  Pakistan;  that  Respondent  No.3/Plaintiff  misled  the  Court 

and  did  not  produce  Nikahnama  and  willfully  mentioned  wrong  address  of  the 

P a g e  | 3 
W.P.No. 134/2022 

Petitioner so as to obtain an ex-parte decree. The learned counsel for the Petitioner 

contended that  the Impugned Order dated 23.10.2021 has incorrectly recorded that 

he  explained  with  regard  to  process  server  reports  dated  20-02-2021  that 

Petitioner/Defendant’s  father  is  an  old  man  of  about  70  years  therefore  forgot  to 

inform  the  Petitioner  regarding  service  and  that  he  did  not  give  any  such 

explanation.  His  stance  was  that  the  learned  courts  below  failed  to  apply  their 

judicial mind and passed the Impugned Judgments/Orders without adhering to the 

relevant  law  and  knocked  out  the  Petitioner/Defendant  on  the  basis  of 

technicalities; and that the maintenance allowance fixed by the learned Trial Court 

is exorbitant as Petitioner’s income has not been considered at the time of passing 

the  ex-parte  judgment  and  decree.  Learned  counsel  has  relied  on  the  judgment 

titled Majid Hussain VSFarrah Naz and others, 2017 YLR 84 in support of his 

contentions. 

6. 

On the other hand, the learned counsel for the Respondents No.3 to 7 argued 

that  parties  are  residing  in  Islamabad  and  it  is  crystal  clear  from  the  order  dated 

26.02.2020 that the Petitioner refused to receive the notice, therefore, proclamation 

was issued in “Daily Ausaaf”; that Petitioner was arrested from Islamabad and he 

has also submitted surety bonds of Islamabad. Learned counsel for Respondent No. 

3 to 7 relied upon the cases of Dilshad Bibi VS The State and others, PLD 2019 

Islamabad 476 and Muhammad Zaman VS Uzma Bibi, 2012 CLC 24.  

7. 

In rebuttal, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that his father is 

his surety who is admittedly a resident of Islamabad however, the same does not 

have any bearing on the status of the Petitioner himself. 

8. 

Arguments heard, record perused.  

9. 

In short, the Petitioner has challenged the jurisdiction of the learned Family 

Court on the basis of his allegation that all parties are permanent residents of Azad 

P a g e  | 4 
W.P.No. 134/2022 

Jammu & Kashmir. Whereas, perusal of  the plaint filed by the Respondents No.3 

to 7 before the learned Family Court shows that it does not disclose whether or not 

Respondents No. 3 to 7 are citizens of Pakistan. What has been mentioned in the 

plaint  to  claim  jurisdiction  of  the  Family  Court  is  that  the  Plaintiffs  [i.e. 

Respondents  No.  3  to  7]  are  residing  at  Islamabad  and  that  cause  of  action  also 

accrued in Islamabad. In such circumstances, it is important to consider Rule 6 of 

the West Pakistan Family Courts Rules, 1965, which provides as follows: 

“6.   The Court which shall have jurisdiction to try a suit will be that within 
the local limits of which-  

(a) the cause of action wholly or in part has arisen, or  

(b) where the parties reside or last resided together:  

Provided  that  in  suits  for  dissolution  of  marriage  or  dower,  the  Court  within 
the  local  limits  of  which  the  wife  ordinarily  resides  shall  also  have 
jurisdiction.” 

10.  The Court in the case of Majid Hussain VSFarrah Naz and others, 2017 

YLR  84  observed  that  it  may  not  be  sufficient  reason  to  return  a  plaint  or  to 

dismiss  a  suit  simply  because  one  or  both  the  parties  to  a  suit  under  the  West 

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  are  not  citizens  of  Pakistan  provided  that  the 

cause of action accrued to the plaintiff within the jurisdiction of the Family Court 

where  the  suit  has  been  instituted.  Whether  or  not  the  Respondent  is  a  Pakistani 

citizen  and/or  whether  the  cause  of  action  accrued  in  Islamabad  can  only  be 

resolved by recording evidence. 

11.  However, the learned Family Court has passed an ex-parte decree against the 

Petitioner after affecting notice on an address located in Islamabad as provided by 

the  Respondents  No.3  to  7  in  the  title  of  the  suit  and  upon  failure  of  service  on 

such address by affecting service by publication. On the other hand, the Petitioner 

maintains that such address is not his and that he is a permanent resident of Azad 

 
 
 
 
P a g e  | 5 
W.P.No. 134/2022 

Jammu & Kashmir and that the Respondents provided wrong address purposely so 

service could not be made upon him. 

12. 

It is noted that as per Impugned Order dated 23.10.2021 learned counsel for 

the Petitioner/Defendant was confronted with the report dated 20.02.2020 filed by 

the  Process  Server  according  to  which  service  was  properly  affected.  The  said 

Impugned Order records that the learned counsel for the Defendant explained that 

the  father  of  the  Petitioner  is  an  old  man  of  more  than  70  years  who  forgot  to 

inform  the  Petitioner/Defendant.  As  noted  above  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Petitioner has denied making such statement.  

13.  Be  that  as  it  may,  service  on  the  Petitioner’s  father  cannot  be  termed 

personal service in any event unless it is proved that the Petitioner lives in the same 

house  as  the  father.  According  to  Rule  12  of  Order  V,  C.P.C.,  wherever  it  is 

practicable,  service  shall  be  made  on  the  defendant  in  person,  unless  he  has  an 

agent empowered to accept service, in which case service on such agent shall be 

sufficient.   Rule 15 of Order V,  C.P.C., provides that where defendant cannot be 

found  and  has  no  agent,  service  may  be  made  on  any  adult  male  member  of  the 

family of the defendant who is residing with him. However, in the present case the 

Petitioner denies that he resides with his father in Islamabad.  

14. 

It  is  further  noted  that  the  order  dated  26.02.2020  records  that  receipt  of 

registered post and report of process server submitted. It further records that as per 

the  report  Defendant  refused  to  receive  notice.  Strangely  enough,  the  Petitioner 

was not confronted with this report of the process server and receipt of registered 

post  on  23.10.2021  when  the  Impugned  Order  was  passed  and  when  he  was 

confronted with the report dated 20.02.2020.  

15.  Moreover,  Rule  17  of  Order  V  CPC  provides  the  procedure  where  the 

defendant refuses to accept service or cannot be found, in such circumstances, the 

P a g e  | 6 
W.P.No. 134/2022 

serving officer shall affix a copy of the summons on the outer door or some other 

conspicuous part of the house. In the instant case, however, service by pasting was 

not carried out.  

16. 

In view of the foregoing, and considering the Petitioner’s denial that he is a 

resident of Islamabad at the address provided by Respondents No.3 to 7/Plaintiffs, 

publication  in  Islamabad  cannot  be  termed  proper  service.  Even  otherwise,  it  is 

settled law that matters should be decided on merits and not technicalities.   

17. 

 Therefore,  in  view  of  the  above  discussion,  I  am  inclined  to  set  aside  the 

Impugned  Judgments/Orders  dated  15.12.2021,  24.02.2021  &  23.10.2021  passed 

by the learned Courts below. The matter is remanded to the learned Family Court 

with direction to proceed with the  case  in accordance with law and  to  decide the 

same after framing of issues including a specific issue regarding jurisdiction of the 

Family Court in Islamabad.
