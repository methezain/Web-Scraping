Ch. Muhammad Naseer, Advocate for petitioner.  

Athar Minallah, C.J.-   Shehryar  Shareef 

son  of  Muhammad  Shareef  (hereinafter  referred  to 

as  the  ‘Petitioner’)  has  invoked  the  jurisdiction  of 

this  Court  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of 

the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973  (hereinafter 

referred 

to  as 

the 

‘Constitution’)  assailing 

judgments and decrees, dated 10-05-2019 and  29-

06-2019,  passed  by  the  learned  trial  court  and  the 

learned appellate court, respectively.  

2. 

The facts, in brief, are that the Petitioner 

had  entered  into  a  marriage  contract  with  Ms 

Maryam  Mustafa  daughter  of  Ghulam  Mustafa 

(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Respondent’). Soon 

after 

the  marriage,  marital  disputes 

led 

to

W.P.  No.2918/2019 

separation  of  the  parties.  Qainaat  daughter  of 

Shehryar  Shareef  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the 

‘Minor’)  was  born  out  of  the  wedlock.  Pursuant  to 

divorce  proceedings,  the  marriage  was  dissolved. 

The  Respondent  contracted  a  second  marriage.  The 

petitioner  filed  a  petition  under  section  25  of  the 

Guardian and Wards Act, 1890 (hereinafter referred 

to as the ‘Act  of  1890’) for seeking custody of the 

Minor.  The  petition  was  dismissed  by  the  learned 

trial  court  vide  judgment,  dated  30-04-2018.  The 

appeal  preferred  by  the  Petitioner  was  allowed  vide 

judgment,  dated  23-11-2018,  and  the  matter  was 

remanded to the learned trial court. The learned trial 

court subsequently again dismissed the petition vide 

judgment  and  decree,  dated  10-05-2019.  The 

appeal  preferred  by 

the  Petitioner  was  also 

dismissed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge, 

Islamabad vide order, dated 29-06-2019. 

3. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  been  heard  at  length.  The  learned  counsel  has 

mainly  argued 

that  after  contracting  second 

marriage, the Respondent had  become ineligible  for 

the  purpose  of  keeping  the  custody  of  the  Minor. 

The  learned  counsel  has  referred  to  a  judgment  of 

 
 
 
 Pg: 3 
W.P.  No.2918/2019 

the  august  Supreme  Court  titled  „Shabana  Naz  v. 

Muhammad Saleem‟ [2014 SCMR 343]. He has also 

placed  reliance  on  a  recent  judgment  of  this  Court 

titled  „Ms  Shazia  Akbar  Ghalzai  and  another  v. 

Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  (East)  and  2 

others‟ [2021 MLD (Islamabad) 817].  

4. 

The learned counsel has been heard and 

the record perused with his able assistance.  

5. 

Admittedly 

the 

Respondent 

had 

contracted a second marriage. The august Supreme 

Court in the case titled „Shabana Naz v. Muhammad 

Saleem‟  [2014  SCMR  343]  has  held  that  the  rule 

that  the  right  of  custody  discontinues  when  the 

mother  contracts  a  second  marriage,  is  not  an 

absolute  rule.  The  relevant  portion  of  the  judgment 

is reproduced as follows.- 

“It  has  been  construed  by  the  Courts  in 

Pakistan  that  this  may  not  be  an 

absolute  rule  but  it  may  be  departed 

from, 

if 

there 

are 

exceptional 

circumstances  to  justify  such  departure 

and  in  making  of  such  departure  the 

only  fact,  which  the  court  has  to  see 

where  the  welfare  of  minor  lies  and 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pg: 4 
W.P.  No.2918/2019 

there  may  be  a  situation  where  despite 

second  marriage  of  the  mother,  the 

welfare  of  minor  may  still  lie  in  her 

custody.” 

6. 

The  judgment  of  the  learned  Guardian 

Judge,  Islamabad,  dated  10-05-2019,  has  been 

carefully  perused.  This  Court  is  satisfied  that  the 

learned court, after taking the relevant matters into 

consideration, had determined the factum of welfare 

of the Minor. The well-reasoned judgment highlights 

the  factors  which  were  taken  into  consideration  by 

the  learned  trial  court.  The  appeal  preferred  by  the 

Petitioner  was  dismissed  by  the  learned  appellate 

court  vide 

judgment,  dated  29-06-2019.  The 

appellate court had also taken into consideration the 

relevant  factors  so  as  to  determine  the  question  of 

welfare  of  the  Minor.  The  learned  counsel,  despite 

his  able  assistance,  was  not  able  to  persuade  this 

Court  that  the  concurrent  findings  suffer  from 

misreading  or  non-reading  or  any  other  legal 

infirmity.  Moreover,  while  exercising  jurisdiction 

under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution,  it  is  neither 

appropriate for this Court to reappraise the evidence 

nor  to  substitute  the  opinions  formed  by  the  two 

 
 
 
 Pg: 5 
W.P.  No.2918/2019 

competent  courts  after  taking  all  the  relevant 

matters into consideration. 

7. 

For  the  above  reasons,  this  petition  is 

without merit and, therefore, accordingly dismissed.
