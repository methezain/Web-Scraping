MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KA YANI, I:  By way  of this common  judgment,  I  intend  to 

decide both the captioned  civil revisions arising out of same judgment  and  decree dated 

31.10.2007, passed  by learned  Additional  District Judge, Islamabad,  whereby  the regular 

first  appeal  filed  by  Aziz-ud-Din  (deceased),  represented  by  LRs, was  dismissed  vide 

consolidated 

judgment  and  decree  dated  13.12.2004, whereby  suit  for  specific 

performance  of agreement,  damages  and  permanent  injunction  filed by  the  said  Aziz- 

ud-Din  (late) was  dismissed,  while  the  suit  for  possession,  recovery  and  permanent 

injunction  filed  by  Muhammad  Yaqoob/respondent  against  Aziz-ud-Din  (late)  was 

decreed. 

2. 

Brief and  consolidated  facts referred  in the  captioned  civil revisions  are  that  the 

predecessor-in-interest  of  the  petitioners  namely  Aziz-ud-Din  (late)  (hereinafter  called 

"plaintiff')  had  filed  a  suit  for  specific performance  of  agreement  to  sell against  the 

respondent  on  the  basis  of  agreement  dated  24.04.1983, regarding  Plot  No.  12, 

measurement  80x42, Sector  G-10/1,  Islamabad,  allotted  by  the  CDA  (hereinafter  called 

"suit  plot'')  against  total sale consideration  of Rs.70,000/-. As per the contents  of plaint, 

it was  agreed  between  the  parties  that  the  respondent  will  transfer  the  suit  plot  in the 

name of plaintiff after acquiring  complete  rights  and  in the meanwhile  the plaintiff had 

C.R. No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007 

Page  I  2 

.J. 
constructed  a  house  upon  the  suit  plot  after  incurring  cost  of  Rs.400,000/-, however 

when the respondent  refused  to transfer  the plot in the name  of plaintiff, the plaintiff as 

an  alternate  claimed  an  amount  of  Rs.850,000/-  being  market  value  of  the  plot, 

compensation  for  non-compliance  of  terms  of  agreement  and  cost  of  construction  as 

referred in Para-6 of the plaint. 

3. 

Conversely,  Muhammad  Yaqoob/respondent  has also filed a suit for possession 

of House  No.12, Sector G-10/1,  Islamabad  (hereinafter  called  "suit  house"),  recovery  of 

Rs.108,000/-  mesne  profit  and  permanent  injunction  against  the  plaintiff  and  also 

contested  the  suit  for  specific  performance  with  the  specific  stance  that  he  neither 

entered  into agreement  to sell nor any sale consideration  of Rs.70,000/- was paid  and as 

such,  the  alleged  agreement  dated  24.04.1983 is  a  forged  document  comprising  of 

forged  signatures  of the  respondent.  Similarly, he is also seeking  possession  of the  suit 

house  on the ground  that  he trusted  upon  the plaintiff due  to close family relationship 

and requested  him to supervise  the construction  work  due to his engagement  in official 

work  and  in  this  regard, 

the  respondent  had  paid  the  plaintiff  an  amount  of 

Rs.275,000/-,  which  was  obtained  from  the  House  Building  Finance  Corporation 

(hereinafter called  "HBFC"), but  at  that  time  the  plaintiff  requested  him  to lease out  the 

suit house at monthly  rent  of Rs.1,600/-, which was accepted by the respondent  and the 

family of plaintiff started  living in the suit house  from 01.03.1984. The rent  was paid up 

to 30.09.1984, whereafter  nothing  was  paid  as per  the  details  provided  in Para-4 of the 

preliminary  objection of written  statement  filed by  the  respondent.  The respondent  in 

his original suit also claimed  the rent  of the said premises w.e.f. October, 1984 till actual 

realization  by  giving  the  details  of rent  of market  referred  in Para-5 & 6  of the  suit for 

possession. 

4. 

The plaintiff  in his written  statement  to suit  for possession  being  defendant  has 

denied the relationship  of landlord  and  tenant, rather  put  emphasis  on the agreement  to 

sell.

5. 

The learned Trial Court after recording of evidence of the parties dismissed the 

Page  I  3 

suit of plaintiff and decreed the suit of the respondent vide consolidated judgment and 

decree dated  10.10.1984. However, the Hon'ble Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench, 

Rawalpindi had decided the RFAs vide judgment and decree dated 26.12.2001, whereby 

the matter  was remanded  to  the  learned Trial Court with  the  direction to  decide the 

case afresh pursuant  to recording of the opinion of handwriting expert. 

6. 

After post remand  proceedings, the signature of the respondent  was compared 

on  the  basis  of  application  for  comparison vide  order  dated  07.03.2002 and  in  this 

regard a report referred as Exh.DW-5/1 was submitted by DW-5 Shouqat Ali/ Assistant 

Director Technical, FIA. 

7. 

The  suits  were  again  decided  vide  consolidated  judgment  and  decree  dated 

13.12.2004, where  suit  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  to  sell  filed  by  the 

plaintiff  was  dismissed,  while  the  suit  filed  by  the  respondent  for  possession  was 

decreed. 

8. 

The plaintiff had  died  during  pendency of said proceedings and  his legal heirs 

namely Ramzan-ul-Haq and  others  were  impleaded,  who  filed  the  two  regular  first 

appeals against the said judgment  and  decree of the learned Trial Court, however the 

same were  dismissed  vide  impugned  judgment  and  decree dated  31.10.2007. Hence, 

these civil revision petitions. 

9. 

Learned  counsel  for  petitioners/LRs  of  the  plaintiff contended  that  both  the 

Courts below have not appreciated the record in its true  perspective and  misread the 

evidence; that  the handwriting  expert's  opinion given by DW-5 Shouqat Ali is illegal 

and without reasons, whereas minor variations in the statements of witnesses could not 

be  considered  fatal  against  the  case  of  plaintiff;  that  the  learned  Trial  Court 

misinterpreted  the  provisions of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order,  1984 and  as such, the 

execution of agreement to sell was duly proved as the agreement was partly performed, 

but this aspect was not taken into account; that solitary statement of DW-4 Muhammad 

Yaqoob denying  the  agreement  to  sell could  not  be  considered  over  and  above the 

C.R.  No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007 

Page  I  4 

j 
overwhelming evidence of the plaintiff, who had  proved  his case through  substantial 

evidence; that the learned first Appellate Court has violated the mandatory provisions 

of Order  41  Rule 31  CPC and  the  learned  Trial Court  has  not  framed  proper  issues 

arising out of the pleadings of the parties. 

10. 

Conversely, learned counsel for respondent contended that the onus to prove the 

agreement to sell is upon the plaintiff, who had not discharged the onus and even failed 

to  proof the consideration as well as the  agreement available on record through  any 

reliable means and as such, the suit for specific performance has rightly been dismissed; 

that  the respondent  has  proved  his case for possession as well as  the  relationship of 

landlord and tenant through cogent evidence, which was not denied in express manner 

by the plaintiff and the learned Trial Court has rightly decided the issues in his favour. 

11.  On the other  hand,  learned  counsel for CDA contended  that  the  suit  plot was 

owned by the respondent  namely Muhammad Yaqoob and  as such, the suit is barred 

under  Section 49-E of  the  CDA  Ordinance,  1960 as  the  plot  was  allotted  to  the 

respondent being member of Central Employees Cooperative Housing Society and the 

plot  could  only  be  transferred  within  the  members  of the  said  Society after  getting 

NOC, which was not done in this case and as such, the learned Trial Court has rightly 

passed the decree. 

12.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

13. 

Perusal of record reveals that the entire case revolves around the counter claim of 

the  plaintiff namely  Aziz-ud-Din (late) and  respondent  namely  Muhammad Yaqoob, 

whereby Plot No.12, measurement 80x42 sq. ft., Sector G-10/1, Islamabad was allotted 

in favour of the respondent, against whom the plaintiff i.e. predecessor-in-interest of the 

petitioners  had  filed  a  suit  for  specific  performance  of  agreement  to  sell  dated 

24.04.1983, as  referred  in  Para-2  of  the  plaint,  against  total  sale  consideration  of 

Rs.70,000/-. The  respondent/ defendant  denied  the  execution  of  such  agreement 

together with his signatures thereon and  filed a counter suit for possession of the suit 

C.R. No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007 
J 
plot along with  recovery  of Rs.108,000/- on account of rent/ compensation for illegal 

Page  I  5 

use and occupation of the suit property w.e.f. 01.10.1984 till 28.09.1987. 

14. 

The main onus to prove the agreement to sell is upon the plaintiff, who appeared 

as  PW-1 in  his  own  favour  and  referred  the  agreement  Exh.PWl/1,  and  produced 

duplicate letter  of allotment  as  Exh.PWl/2  along with  letter  of possession issued by 

CDA as Exh.PWl/3.  PW-1 Aziz-ud-Din further  alleged that  he constructed the house 

with the help  of contractor and  was residing in the said house since November, 1993 

and  as such, all the  utilities including electricity, gas and  water  were  installed on his 

own expenses, even otherwise, he spent an amount of Rs.400,000/- for construction of 

the  suit house, but the  same was  not  transferred  in his name, although  promise was 

made by respondent due to which PW-1 Aziz-ud-Din had got approved the site plan in 

the name of respondent. 

15. 

PW-1 Aziz-ud-Din in  order  to substantiate his case had  produced  Muhammad 

Din  as  PW-2, who  is  the  marginal  witness  of  agreement  to  sell  Exh.PW-1/1 and 

acknowledged his signature, but he could not explain the plot number and stated that a 

deal was done in the shop of plaintiff when he had  gone to the said shop for grocery 

purposes. 

16. 

The  plaintiff  also  produced  Muhammad  Aslam  as  PW-3, who  has  produced 

Mark-A document, which could not be considered as a valid piece of evidence under 

the law, therefore, his statement could not be considered valid. 

17.  While considering the above background, the primary question before this Court 

is as to whether  the  plaintiff had  discharged the onus to  prove the agreement to sell 

Exh.Pl under  the law or otherwise? In this regard, the learned trial Court has framed 

Issue No.3, which is as under: 

to  sell  through  written 
"Whether  defendant  No.1  entered  into  agreement 
agreement  dated  24.04.1983  and  received  sale  consideration?  If so,  with  what 
effect?  OPP 

C.R. No.566/2007 & C.R.  No.567 /2007 
.i 
18.  While considering  the  above  evidence  as well  as Issue  No.3 referred  above, the 

Page I  6 

entire matter  has to be seen in the light of Evidence Act, 1872, as the alleged agreement 

was  executed  prior  to  promulgation  of the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984 i.e. in  the 

year 1983, therefore,  only one witness  could be considered  lawful in terms  of Section 68 

of the Evidence Act, 1872.  Reliance is placed upon  2003 CLC 78 Peshawar  (Said Khoban 

VS Momin  Khan). 

19. 

I  have  also  gone  through  the  mechanism  provided  in  Evidence  Act,  1872, 

wherein  the mode  and  manner  to prove  any document  or a fact has to be considered  in 

the light of Sections 67 & 68  of the  Evidence Act, 1872, which  has certain  prerequisites, 

therefore, both the provisions  have been reproduced  as under: 

If a document  is alleged  to be  signed or to have been  written  wholly  or in 
67. 
part  by  any  person, 
the  signature  or  the  handwriting  of  so  much  of  the 
document  as  is  alleged  to  be  in  that person's  handwriting  must  be  proved  to  be 
in his handwriting. 

If a  document  is  required  by  law  to  be  attested,  it  shall  not  be  used  as 
68. 
evidence  until  one  attesting  witness  at  least  has  been  called for  the  purpose  of 
proving  its  execution,  if there  be  an  attesting  witness  alive,  and  subject  to  the 
process  of the  Court and capable  of giving  evidence; 

Provided  that  it  shall  not  be  necessary  to  call  an  attesting  witness  in 
proof  of  the  execution  of  any  document,  not  being  a  will,  which  has  been 
registered  in  accordance  ·with  the  provisions  of  the  Registration  Act,  1908, 
unless  its execution  by  the person  by whom  it purports  to have  been  executed  is 
specifically  denied. 

20. 

The  above  referred  mandatory  provisions  of  law  impose  a  duty  upon  the 

plaintiff  i.e. predecessor-in-interest  of the  petitioners  to  prove  the  factum  of signature 

on  Exh.PW-1/1  i.e.  as  to  whether  the  respondent  had  signed  the  said  agreement  or 

otherwise? The said  direction  was also given by the Hon'ble  Lahore High Court  in first 

round  of proceedings  when  the matter  was remanded  vide order  dated  26.12.2001 to the 

learned  Trial Court,  whereafter  evidence  of DW-5 Shouqat  Ali/ A.O. Technical Wing, 

FIA  was  recorded,  who  submitted  report  Exh.DW-5/1  qua  the  signature  of  the 

respondent  in the following manner: 

"The examination  of  the  case  has  revealed  that  the  questioned  signatures  now 
marked  as  "A"  on original  Agreement  Exh.P/1.  is forged  in  characteristics  such 
treamour,  pen  lifts,  re-tracing,  re-touching,  pen  stops,  and 
as  hesitation, 

C.R. No.566/2007  & C.R. No.567 /2007 

Page  I  7 

compare to  the specimen and routine signatures  now marked as  S/1  to S/10, and 
R/1  to  R/9  (on  the  deed of assignment  and partnship  No.130923,  dated 27-10- 
83),  R/10  to R/18  (on  deed of assignment  & partnership  No.130925  (triplicate), 
R/19  on  original  I.D.  Card,  regi.stration  No.101-41-004092,  Serial  No.A] 
035324,  dated  1-11-73,  R/20  on  Agreement  dated  3-5-83  between  CDA  and 
Muhammad  Yaqoob, of Muhammad  Yaqoob provided for  comparison." 

21.  DW-5 Shouqat Ali was  cross examined at length by the  plaintiff regarding the 

above referred report,  but  nothing  was  discovered in favour  of the  plaintiff and  the 

signature of the respondent  was proved to be fake as DW-5 Shouqat Ali stated in his 

evidence that: that:

II -v..t a.;:;....L~..:.-1.:oc:- J.1Jt,J ,;.11lv.,t a 

22. 

The above referred findings, if seen in the light of Section 67 of the Evidence Act, 

1872, whereby  "the  signature  or  the  handwriting  of so  much  of the  document  as  is 

alleged to  be in that person's  handwriting  must  be proved  to  be in his handwriting",  as 

such, the plaintiff was liable to prove the signature of the respondent in all respects and 

when  such  onus  was  not  discharged,  the  very  foundation  claimed by  the  plaintiff 

crumbles down as the signature of the respondent was not proved. 

23. 

It is trite law that when the document is disputed  or the signature was denied, 

the onus has been shifted upon  the beneficiary to prove the very existence of the fact 

regarding; 

a) 

b) 

c) 

d) 

Due execution of agreement Exh.PW-1/1; 

Payment of sale consideration of Rs.70,000/-; 

Signature of the respondent (seller) on the document Exh.PW-1/1; and, 

Contents of the document Exh.Pl. 

All the above referred facts have not been proved by the petitioners in  their evidence, 

although the opinion of the handwriting expert is only a corroborative piece of evidence 

as held in 2008 CLC 1228 Karachi (Ahmed through LRs  VS Mst.  Zainbun  Nissa  through 

LRs), 2006 SCMR 193 (Mst. Saadat  Sultan,  etc. VS Muhammad  Zahur Khan), 2008 YLR 

952 Lahore (Dr. Azher Ata Malik  VS Chairman NAB), 1971 P.Cr.Ll 918 Lahore (Ghulam 

C.R.  No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007

Abbas  VS The State),  1968 SCMR  1126 (Syed Shabbir Hussain  VS  The State), PLD 1962 

Page  I  8 

SC 102 (Ali Ahmad alias Ali Ahmad  Mia  VS The State)  and PLD 1960 Dhaka  897 (M.A. 

Motalib  VS The State).  In all these case laws, it was settled that the expert opinion being 

a  corroborative  piece  of  evidence  is  circumstantial  in  its  nature  and  cannot  be 

considered  final  word  on  the  subject and  as  such,  even  the  Court  is entitled  to  make 

independent  comparison  of handwriting  apart  from the opinion  of the expert, therefore, 

while  relying  upon  the  above  principles,  when  the  expert  report  comes  against  the 

claim of the  plaintiff,  he has  to prove  other  factors through  independent  means  failing 

which it is considered  that  he has failed to discharge  his onus,  especially when  Section 

67 of the Evidence Act, 1872 was incorporated  by the legislature. 

24. 

I  have  also attended  the  proposition  in hand  on the  basis  of Sections 59, 60,  61, 

and  62 of  the  Evidence  Act,  1872, whereby  all  facts  have  to  be  proved  through  oral 

evidence, except the contents  of document,  and  the facts referred  in the document  must 

be proved  through  direct  evidence  in shape  of primary  evidence,  whereas  in this  case 

the factum  of payment  of Rs.70,000/- on account  of sale consideration  was  not  proved 

independently  nor  any  such  evidence  has  been  brought  on  record  through  which  it 

could  be proved  that  such  a  huge  amount  was  available  with  the  plaintiff  back in  the 

year  1983 to be paid  to the  respondent  through  any  banking  instrument,  therefore,  the 

basic onus was not discharged  by the plaintiff in support  of his case. 

25. 

The  other  important 

issues  in  this  regard  i.e.  Issue  No.7,  8,  9  and  10,  are 

reproduced  as under: 

7. 

8. 

9. 

10. 

Whether  defendant  No.1  is entitled  to  the possession  of the  suit  house  as 
prayed for?  OPD-1 
Whether  defendant  No.1  is  entitled  to  recovery  of  Rs.1,08,000/-  from 
1.1.1984  to 28.9.87  as prayed for?  OPD-1 
Whether  defendant  No.1  is entitled  to  the  mesne  profit  as  prayed for?  If 
so,  to what extent?  OPD-1 
What  is status  of plaintiff for  his occupation  of the suit  house?  OPP 

26. · 

The onus  to prove  above referred  issues was  upon  the respondent,  however  the 

respondent  has taken  the stance that  he had  leased out the premises  to the plaintiff and 

C.R. No.566/2007 & C.R.  No.567 /2007 
..l 
by taking  such plea, he has  to discharge  the onus  to the effect that  the parties  had  ever 

Page I  9 

executed  a  document  of lease  in  terms  of Section 105 of the  Transfer  of Property  Act, 

1882, whereas  no  such  document  was  brought  on record,  rather  the  entire  case is built 

upon  oral  testimony  of  the  respondent,  although  it  is  not  denied  that  the  suit  plot 

belongs to the respondent  at the initial stage and  same is in the name  of the respondent 

as  of  today.  The  relationship  has  to  be  established  by  way  of  other  circumstances 

brought  on record like; 

1. 

ii. 

Handing  over possession of the property; 

Receiving of rent; and, 

iii. 

Notice for determination  of lease. 

27. 

I  have  attended  to  the  above  position  from  the  testimony  of the  respondent  i.e. 

Muhammad  Yaqoob,  who  appeared  as  DW-4  and  admitted 

that  he  had  family 

relationship  with  the plaintiff, who  was appointed  for supervision  of construction  work 

of the house  and  in this  regard  the respondent  had  paid  an amount  of Rs.275,000/- for 

the construction  of the  said  building,  whereafter  he received  a loan  from  HBFC and  in 

his examination-in-chief, he stated  that:

During  the  course  of cross-examination,  DW-4 Muhammad  Yaqoob/respondent 

admitted  his evidence  that:

Besides the above referred  evidence, no material  evidence was brought  on record 

through  which  it could  be proved  that  the  suit  house  was  handed  over to the  plaintiff 

C,:.R.  No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007 

Page  I  10 

on  rent,  therefore,  the  principle  of  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984 comes  into  play, 

wherein  Article 117 of the  said  Order  lays a heavy  onus  upon  the respondent  to prove 

his legal right  or a liability depending  on the existence of fact which  he asserts, he must 

prove that those facts exist, therefore, the onus to prove those facts of lease agreement  is 

upon  the  respondent  in  terms  of  Article  118  of  the  Qanun-e-Shahadat  Order,  1984, 

which  he  had  failed  to  discharge,  hence  it  is confidently  held  that  the  relationship  of 

landlord  and  tenant  was  neither  in  existence nor  the  respondent  proved  that  he  ever 

received any  rent  as per  his own  claim from the plaintiff. Similarly, the  entire record  is 

silent qua  determination  of lease as required  in terms  of Section 111  of the  Transfer  of 

Property  Act, 1882, nor any notice was given by the respondent  in this regard. 

30. 

In view of above, the following facts have been observed  from the record. 

a) 

Suit  Plot  No.12,  Sector  G-10/1,  Islamabad  was  allotted  to  Muhammad 

Yaqoob/respondent  by  the  CDA  for  being  the  member  of  the  Central 

Employees Cooperative  Housing  Society. 

b) 

The 

respondent 

handed 

over 

the 

suit  plot 

to  Aziz-ud-Din 

(deceased)/plaintiff  for the purpose  of construction  of a house. 

c) 

Claim  of the  plaintiff  regarding  agreement  to sell of the suit  plot through 

Exh.PW-1/1,  dated  24.04.1983, is not proved. 

d)

proved  independently  through  any banking channel or any other mode. 

e) 

The  fact  of  payment  made  by  the  respondent 

to  the  plaintiff  for 

construction  of the suit house is not proved. 

f) 

Relationship  of  landlord  and  tenant  between  the  respondent  and  the

him.

g) 

DW-5 Shouqat  Ali/Handwriting  expert  opined  in his report  Exh.DW-5/1 

that  the  signature  of the respondent  on agreement  to sell (Exh.PW-1/1) is 

forged. 

h)  Muhammad  Yaqoob/respondent  has  obtained  a loan  from  HBFC for the 

construction  of house  over  the  suit  plot,  which  has  been  confirmed  from 

DW-3  Muhammad  Younas,  District  Manager,  HBFC, who  has  referred 

certified  copy  of  application  dated  17.08.1983 for  HBFC  Loan  with 

reference to suit plot as Exh.DW-3/1, deed  of assignment  dated  02.11.1983 

as  Exh.DW-3/8,  agreement  dated  03.05.1983 as  Exh.DW-3/9,  permission 

to assign  in favour  of HBFC as Exh.DW-3/10,  certificate of possession  as 

Exh.DW-3/11 and  approval  of building  plan as Exh.DW-3/13. 

31. 

In view  of above,  both  the  Courts  below  have  concurrently  decided  the  suit for 

specific  performance  in  favour  of  the  respondent  and  dismissed  the  claim  of  the 

plaintiff  in  accordance  with  law  and  as  such,  the  plaintiff  had  failed  to  discharge  his 

onus as he could  not  prove  the transfer  of payment  of Rs.70,000/- as sale consideration 

to the respondent.  Similarly, the signature  of the respondent  was declared  to be forged, 

although  same  is  corroborative  in  nature,  but  the  probability  leans  in  favour  of  the 

respondent  as no contrary  evidence was brought  on record  by the plaintiff. Hence, suit 

for specific performance  filed by the plaintiff was rightly  dismissed  by the learned  trial 

Court as well as by the first Appellate Court. 

32. 

Similarly,  the  claim  of  the  respondent  regarding  rent  of  the  suit  house  is  not 

proved  in terms  of requirements  laid down  in Transfer of Property  Act, 1882, therefore, 

the judgment  and  decree  passed  in his  favor  to  the  extent  of rent  amount  is illegal as 

findings  on Issue No.8 are  not  legally proved  from  the evidence,  hence, the concurrent 

findings  of both  the  Courts  below  to  the  extent  of payment  of lease/rent in  shape  of 

decree  of  recovery  are  hereby  SET  ASIDE  and  the  claim  of  the  respondent  is  to  be 

treated  to the extent of possession  of the suit plot only as he himself acknowledged  that 

C.R.  No.566/2007  & C.R.  No.567 /2007 

Page  I  12 

initially he had  delivered  possession  of the  suit  plot  to the  plaintiff  for  the  purpose  of 

construction  of a house,  although  the said fact was independently  not proved. 

33.  On the basis of above discussion, while considering  the judgments  and decrees of 

the  learned  Trial  Court  as  well  as  of the  learned  first  Appellate  Court,  both  the  civil 

revision petitions  are decided  in following terms: 

a)  The claim of the plaintiff namely late Aziz-ud-Din regarding  specific performance 

of agreement  to  sell Exh.PW-1/1  has  rightly  been  dismissed  by  both  the  Courts 

below through  impugned  judgments  and  decrees and  the captioned  civil revision 

petitions to that  extent are hereby DISMISSED on the ground  that  this Court will 

not interfere into the concurrent findings of both the Courts below. 

b)  The relief granted  to respondent  on the basis of Issue No.8 regarding  entitlement 

of rent is not  proved  as he has failed to establish the relationship  of landlord  and 

tenant,  therefore,  the  findings  of Issue No.8 to the extent  are hereby  SET ASIDE 

and the captioned  civil revision  petitions  of the petitioners  to that extent only are 

ALLOWED.  Rest of the judgments  and decrees are MAINTAINED.
