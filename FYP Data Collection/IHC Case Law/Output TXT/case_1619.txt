Mr. Muhammad  Safdar  AIi Bhattt  Advocate  for petitioner

Mr. Hasnain Haider, State Counsel.

Imt,az, ASI P.S. Secretariat, Islamabad.

MOHSIN AKHTAR KAYANI. I:  Through this

criminal miscellaneous  petition, the petitioner has prayed for

post arrest bail in case FIR No.L6,  dated  15.07.2020,  under

Section 392 PPC, P.S.  Secretariat, Islamabad.

2. 

Brief facts as referred  in the instant case are that

Muhammad Farhan (Respondent  No.2)  submitted  a

complaint having  allegations that on 15.0'I...2020, he along

with his family members  were robbed  of cash amount  of

Rs.96,000/-,  two gold rings  amounting  to Rs.100,000/-,  two

mobile  phones  (Huawei  Y9S & Huawei Y62) n Lake View

Park. As soon  as the robber  left, the complainant made hue

and cry, whereupon the robber was apprehended  with the

help of people gathered  there. On arrival of the police

officials,  the robber  i.e. present petitioner was  formally

arrested and the said  snatched articles  were recovered.  The

petitioner  applied for his post arrest bail before the leamed

Magishate  and leamed  Sessions  fudge,  Isl,amabad,  which

were rejected vide orders  dated  11,.02.2020 and  24.02.2020.

Hence, the instant post  arrest  bail application.

3. 

Leamed counsel  for petitioner  contends that the

petitioner  has no criminal  record whatsoever,  rather  he has

Crl. Misc.N o.7 67 -82020

I2l

falsely been  implicated  in the instant  FIR and confined  in the

jail for the last six (06) months;  that complete challan  of the

instant case has been  submitted  before  the learned  trial Court

but the uial has not yet been commenced;  that  the petitioner

is behind  the bars since his arrest and investigation  of the

case has been completed,  therefore,  keeping  the petitioner

behind  the bars would  serve  no useful purpose.

4. 

Conversely, leamed  State  Counsel  opposed  the

instant post  arrest bail application  on the grounds that prima

facie, petitioner  has  been  caught red-handed  in possession  of

the snatched  articles rendering  him to be the real culpri!

therefore, the instant post arrest  bail application may be

dismissed.

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard,  record perused.

The tentative assessment of record reveals that

petitioner  has been  nominated in case FIR No.16,  dated

15.07,2020,  under Section  392/411, PPC, P.S. Secretariat,

Islamabad  with  a specific  role of comrrdtting  robbery  on gun

point in the premises of Lake View Park,  whereby  he

snatched cash, mobile phones and jewelry  articles from

complainant and his family members,  however  he was

arrested  immediately after the incident along with pistol and

all the snatched articles  were  recovered, which,  pima  facic,

links  the petitioner with the comnrission of heinous crime  of

robbery.

7. 

The clullan  has been submitted in the Court on

18.02.2020  and trial is likely to be cornmenced sooner. The

petitioner  has been charged  with the offence falling  within

the prohibitory  clause of Section 497  Cr.P.C.  and even  no

ground  of further inquiry has been demonstrated  by the

petitioner  in this  case.

8. 

kr view of above, the instant post arrest bail

application is without merits,  therefore, the same is

herebv DISMISSED.

9. 

However,  while considering  the analogy drawn  from

case reported  as 2077 SCMR  7332  (Rehmat Ullah os, The

Stg&L  the leamed Trial Court seized with the matter  is

directed to conclude  the trial within the period of 06 months,

under intimation  to this  court.
