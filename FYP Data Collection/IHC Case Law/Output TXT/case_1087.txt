Hussain, Advocates for respondent No.3 

The  petitioner  through  the  instant  writ 

petition has called in question the legality and 

validity  of  impugned  judgment  and  decree 

dated  08.10.2020,  passed  by  the  learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Judge  Family  Court) 

West-Islamabad  as  well  as 

impugned 

Judgment  and  decree  dated  08.07.2021, 

passed by the learned Additional District Judge 

(MCAC), West-Islamabad, whereby suit filed by 

respondent No.3 was decreed. 

02. 

Succinctly  stated,  the  facts  of  the  case 

are  that  marriage  of  the  petitioner  and 

respondent  No.3  was  solemnized  according  to 

Muslim Rights and Ceremonies on 16.01.2006,

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

against 

the  consideration  of  Haq  Mehar 

amounting  to  Rs.  50,000/-  which  was  paid  by 

the  petitioner  at  the  time  of  marriage  in  the 

form  of  gold  ornaments  duly  mentioned  in 

Nikahnama.   

03. 

From the wedlock, one son namely Abu 

Bakar and a daughter namely Zunaira Shaukat 

were born.  

04.  Marriage  of  the  parties  was  dissolved 

through  Khula  and  the  petitioner  got  custody 

of minor children by order of this Court.  

05.  Respondent  No.3  instituted  a  suit  for 

recovery  of  maintenance,  dowry  articles  and 

personal  belongings.  Out  of  divergent 

pleadings  of  the  parties,  issues  were  framed; 

evidence  was  recorded  and  suit  filed  by 

respondent  No.3  was  decreed;  she  was  held 

entitled  for  maintenance  allowance  for  her 

iddat  period  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per 

month;  minor  children  were  held  entitled  for 

recovery of maintenance allowance at the rate 

of  Rs.  5,000/-  per  month  w.e.f  October,  2019 

till  their  legal  entitlement  with  5%  annual 

increase  and  respondent  No.3  was  also  held 

 
 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

entitled  for  recovery  of  dowry  articles  as  per 

list Exh.P-2.  

06.  Being  aggrieved  from  the  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated  08.10.2020,  the 

petitioner  filed  an  appeal  before  the  learned 

Additional  District 

Judge 

(MCAC),  West-

Islamabad  which  was  also  dismissed  vide 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

08.07.2021. 

07. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner states 

that  she  has  challenged 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  only  to  the  extent  of 

relief  granted  to  respondent  No.3,  whereby 

she  was  held  entitled  for  recovery  of  dowry 

articles as per list Exh.P-2. 

08. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, inter 

alia, contends  that  learned  Courts  below  have 

failed  to  appreciate  the  evidence  produced  by 

the  petitioner  and  has  misread,  misconstrued 

and  misinterpreted  the  evidence  led  by  the 

petitioner  while  passing 

the 

impugned 

judgments/decrees  dated  08.10.2020  and 

08.07.2021.  

 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

09.  Both  the 

impugned 

judgments  and 

decrees  are  based  upon  surmises  and 

conjectures,  hence  are  not  sustainable  in  the 

eye  of  law.  Both  the  learned  Courts  below 

have failed to give the due deliberations on the 

issues  particularly  issue  No.3  and  passed  the 

judgments without any legal justification.    

10.  Respondent  No.3  belongs  to  a  poor 

family;  her  father  passed  away  in  the  year 

2001  before  her  marriage  and  her  brothers 

were jobless at the time of her marriage; they 

were  not  in  a  position  to  give  such  a  huge 

dowry  articles  mentioned  in  the  list  produced 

by respondent No.3.  

11. 

Learned Courts below while passing the 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  to  the 

extent  of  amount  of  dowry  articles,  ignored 

the  financial  status  of  parents  of  respondent 

No.3;  learned  Courts  have  not  appointed  any 

local  commission  to  determine  the  value  of 

dowry  articles;  no 

receipts  have  been 

produced by respondent No.3 in her evidence; 

exaggerated  value  of  dowry  articles  has  been 

mentioned 

in  Ex.P2,  hence  prayed 

that 

 
 
 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

impugned  judgments/decrees  are  liable  to  be 

set aside. Learned counsel has relied upon the 

cases reported as PLD 2013 Islamabad 11, 

PLD  2005  Lahore  504,  2020  YLR  282  & 

2007 MLD 379.     

12. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

contesting 

respondent  has  controverted  the  arguments 

advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner 

and  has  stated  that  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  have  been  passed 

strictly 

in 

accordance with law; the list of dowry articles 

was  exhibited  and  the  petitioner  has  also 

admitted  in  his  evidence  that  dowry  articles 

were  brought  by  respondent  No.3  at  the  time 

of wedding and has prayed for dismissal of the 

instant  writ  petition.  Learned  Counsel  has 

relied upon the cases reported as 2017 SCMR 

321,  2008  SCMR  1584,  2012  YLR  2693, 

2012  MLD  756,  2021  YLR  108  &  2019 

CLC 1008. 

13. 

I  have  heard  the  arguments  advanced 

by  both  the  parties  and  record  has  been 

perused with their able assistance. 

 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

14. 

It is mentioned by the  respondent No.3 

/  plaintiff  in  para-5  of  plaint  filed  in  the  Court 

of 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  that  the 

petitioner  snatched  the  gold  ornaments  which 

were given to respondent No.3 by her parents. 

15.  Respondent No.3 / plaintiff mentioned in 

para  No.2  of  the  plaint  that  her  parents  gave 

dowry articles as per list attached.   

16. 

Petitioner  has  vehemently  denied  in 

para  No.2 

in  his  written  statement  by 

mentioning that:  

”Para No.2 of the plaint is incorrect, 

hence vehemently denied, no dowry 

articles are lying in the house of 

defendant.”   

17.  During  the  course  of  arguments,  the 

petitioner  has  admitted  that  respondent  No.3 

brought  the  dowry  articles  amounting  to  Rs. 

70,000/-  approximately  which  have  been 

returned to her after passing of the impugned 

judgments/decrees. Whereas, respondent No.3 

present in person states that she has produced 

legal  and  cogent  evidence  in  support  of  her 

contention  regarding  the  dowry  articles  and 

she  was  thrown  by  the  petitioner  out  of  his 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

house  in  plain  clothes;  all  the  dowry  articles 

were  retained  by  the  petitioner  and  the 

impugned  judgments  /  decrees  have  rightly 

been passed by both the learned Courts below.       

18. 

There  are  concurrent  findings  of  both 

the 

learned  Courts  below  against 

the 

petitioner. In case of concurrent findings of the 

courts  below,  scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition  becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner 

has failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading of evidence. It has been laid down in a 

case titled as “Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS Abdul 

Samad through L.Rs. and 2 others” (2008 

YLR 2309)” that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

interfered when  the  orders  of 

the Courts below are fanciful or 

based  on  misreading  or  non-

reading  of  the  evidence".  The 

same  view  has  also  been  taken  in  a 

case 

titled  as  “Sadruddin  VS 

Aslam  Madad  Ali  and  others” 

(PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

 
 
  
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

19. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is  only 

available  to  quash  a  decision  for  an  error  of 

law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for  correcting 

errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court 

or  a  tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise 

its  jurisdiction  or  where  the  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts 

illegally 

in  exercise  of 

its 

undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice. The High Court while issuing a writ of 

certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of  supervisory  and 

not  appellate  jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in 

exercise of its writ jurisdiction will not review 

the  findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal. Reliance may be made to 

the following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan VS Muhammad Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle of law that the 

High  Courts  must  not 

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the  discretion  exercised 

by lower courts unless the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has been passed without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of evidence, or is not in 

accordance with the law. 

If none of these errors is 

present, the High Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

a different conclusion as 

to  the  controversy  than 

the latter. In this regard, 

reference can be made to 

a  collective  reading  of 

Mst.  Mobin  Fatima  v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad  (1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

(ii) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"President  All  Pakistan 

Women 

Association, 

Peshawar 

Cantt 

VS 

Muhammad Akbar Awan and 

others” (2020 SCMR 260),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It  is  settled  law  that 

when the Statute does not 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

same 

cannot 

be 

challenged  by  invoking 

the 

constitutional 

jurisdiction  of  the  High 

Court in order to gain a 

similar objective. Where a 

Statute  has  expressly 

barred a remedy which is 

not  available  to  a  party 

under  the  Statute,  it 

cannot 

be 

sought 

indirectly by resort to the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of  the  High  Court.  The 

High  Courts  exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

advancing  the  policy  of 

law  and  delivering 

expeditious  justice  in 

accordance with the law 

and the Constitution. Even 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and  discretionary 

in 

nature and should not be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass the purpose of a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"Where the Court or the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such 

determination 

cannot  ordinarily  be 

interfered  with  by  the 

High 

Court  while 

exercising 

jurisdiction 

under Article 199 of the 

Constitution."  

 
 
 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it 

is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate  court  / 

Tribunal in a fair and just 

manner without violating 

or  disregarding  statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned  Judges  of  the 

High  Court  for  future 

course of action:  

 
 
 
13

(i)  Brig (Rtd.) Imtiaz 

Ahmed  v.  Government 

of  Pakistan,  through 

Secretary, 

Interior 

Division, 

Islamabad 

(1994 SCMR 2142). 

(ii)  Shahnaz Begum v. 

The Hon’ble Judges of 

the High Court of Sindh 

and  Balochistan  (PLD 

1971 SC 677). 

(iii)  Malik Shaukat Ali 

Dogar v. Ghulam Qasim 

Khan  Khakwani  (PLD 

1994 SC 281).  

 (v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam  VS  Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others” (PLD 

2007 SC 45),  it  is  held  by  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court that: 

"The  High  Court  in 

exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

is  not  supposed  to 

interfere  in  the  findings 

on  the  controversial 

question of facts based on 

evidence  even  if  such 

finding is erroneous. The 

scope  of  the  judicial 

review of the High Court 

under Article 199 of the 

 
 
 
14 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

Constitution in such cases, 

is limited to the extent of 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence  or  if  the 

finding  is  based  on  no 

evidence which may cause 

miscarriage of justice but 

it  is  not  proper  for  the 

High Court to disturb the 

finding  of  fact  through 

reappraisal of evidence in 

writ 

jurisdiction  or 

exercise  this  jurisdiction 

as a substitute of revision 

or appeal”. 

20. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed  to  point  out  as  to  how  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are  the  consequence 

of  an  error  of law or  without  jurisdiction  or in 

excess of jurisdiction.  

21. 

For what has been discussed above, the 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

08.10.2020,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court-West,  Islamabad  as  well  as 

impugned 

Judgment  and  decree  dated 

08.07.2021,  passed  by  the  learned  Additional 

District 

Judge,  West-Islamabad 

are 

in 

accordance  with  law  and  facts  of  the  matter 

and  do  not  require  interference  by  this  Court. 

 
 
 
 
15 

Writ Petition No.2790 of 2021 

The  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable,  hence 

dismissed being meritless.
