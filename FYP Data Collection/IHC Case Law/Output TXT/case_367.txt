Proceedings 
15.08.2022  Mr. Abdul Hameed, Advocate for the petitioner.  

Mr.  Farhat  Ullah  Jan,  Advocate  for  respondent 
No.1.  

The  petitioner  has  impugned  the  order 

passed  by  the  learned  Additional  District  Court 

dated  10.01.2022,  pursuant 

to  which  his 

application  for  leave  to  defend  the  suit  was 

dismissed for being time barred.  

2.  

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contended  that  this  Court  had  issued  Notification 

No.  F.(01)/Genl/IHC/9770  dated  30.09.2021, 

pursuant  to  which  it  was  clarified  that  limitation 

period for purposes of Section 12 of the Limitation 

Act,  1908  (”Act”)  would  not  apply 

from 

24.03.2020  to  30.09.2021  for  purposes  of  filing 

any  suit,  petition  and  appeal  etc.,  in  view  of  the 

emergency  situation  that  had  emerged  due  to 

Covid-19.  He 

further 

submitted 

that 

the 

application  of  the  petitioner  for  leave  to  appear

and defend the suit ought to have been heard and 

decided on its merits, which was not done.  

3. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

respondent 

submitted  that  there  was  no  infirmity  in  the 

impugned  order  dated  10.01.2022,  whereby  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge  had  dismissed 

the  application  filed  by  the  petitioner  for  being 

barred by limitation.  

4. 

This  Court  had  issued  notification  dated 

30.09.2021  clarifying 

that 

in  view  of 

the 

emergency  situation  prevailed  due  to  Covid-19 

the  time  period  from  24.03.2020  to  30.09.2021 

would be excluded for the purposes of computing 

the  limitation  in  terms  of  section  12  of  the 

Limitation  Act,  1908.  It  appears  that  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  parties  were  unable  to  draw  the 

attention  of  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

to 

the 

aforementioned 

notification 

and 

consequently  the  said  notification  had  not  been 

discussed  in  the impugned order. The notification 

dated 30.09.2021 states the following: 

  “Whereas, due to pandemic Corona-virus 

(COVID-19)coupled  with  lock-down  policy 

of the Federal government, this court vide 

Office  Order  No.  181/IHC/2020    dated 

24.03.2020,  was  pleased  to  direct  that 

owing 

to 

the  prevailing  emergency 

situation  in  the  country,  the  period  of 

limitation  prescribed  by  laws  in  filing 

 
 - 3-                        W.P No.630/2022. 

appeals/petitions  etc  in  this  court  as  well 

as 

in 

the  Civil  and  District  Courts, 

Islamabad,  till  the  time  the  situation 

returns to normalcy, shall be deemed to be 

condoned  and 

the  courts  shall  be 

presumed to be closed during the period in 

the  public  interest,  within  the  meaning 

Section 4 of the Limitation Act, 1908.   

2. 

Now  the  Federal  Government  has 

lifted  certain  restrictions  earlier  imposed 

by it, therefore, keeping in view the policy 

of  the  Government,  the  Hon’ble  Authority 

has  been  pleased  to  direct  that  the  above 

said Office Order shall cease to have effect 

from  30.09.2021  and  the  period  from 

24.03.2020 

to  30.09.2021 

shall  be 

excluded for the purpose of computing the 

limitation  in  terms  of  Section  12  of  the 

Limitation  Act  1908,  for  filing  any  suit, 

petition and appeal, etc.  

5. 

The object of issuing the notification was to 

take  cognizance  of  the  hardship  that  litigating 

parties were facing in seeking access to justice. 

6. 

Given  that  this  aspect  of  the  matter  has 

not  been  addressed  in  the  impugned  order,  the 

instant  petition  is  allowed  and  consequently  the 

impugned  order  is  set-aside.  The  application  of 

the  petitioner  seeking  leave  to  defend  the  suit 

shall  be  deemed  to  pending  before  the  learned 

Additional District Judge. The parties are directed 

to  appear  before  the  learned  Additional  District 

 
 
 - 4-                        W.P No.630/2022. 

Judge on 25.08.2022 to enable the learned court 

to adjudicate the application on its merits. 

Saeed.
