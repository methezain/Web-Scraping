Mr. Kaleem Ullah Pirzada, Advocate for petitioner 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the  petitioner  has 

called  in  orders  of  the  learned  Executing  Court,  dated 

22.10.2021  and  03.11.2021,  whereby  directions  were  passed 

to the extent of blocking of petitioner’s CNIC, passport and 

SIMs.  

2. 

Succinctly,  Muhammad  Asif  Khan  (petitioner)  and 

Mst.  Nadia  Khalil  (respondent  No.1)  tied  the  knot  on 

25.08.2013  against  dower  in  shape  of  gold  ornaments 

weighing  3  ½  Tolas,  however  sooner  the  petitioner  went 

abroad 

to  earn  bread  and  butter 

leaving  behind 

respondent  No.1  in  Pakistan  to  live  at  her  own  expenses. 

Later  on,  respondent  No.1  filed  a  suit  for  recovery  of 

maintenance  and  dowry  articles,  which  was  partially 

decreed  vide  order  dated  14.02.2020  only  to  the  extent  of 

dowry  articles,  as  such, 

feeling  aggrieved 

thereof, 

respondent  No.1  preferred  an  appeal,  which  was  decreed 

vide order dated 05.10.2020 to the extent of maintenance to 

be  paid  by  the  petitioner  @  Rs.15,000/-  per  month  w.e.f. 

25.08.2013 with annual enhancement of 10%. Accordingly, 

respondent No.1 filed execution petition, per se, objections

filed  thereto  by  the  petitioner  were  dismissed  by  the 

learned  Executing  Court  on  22.10.2021  with  the  outcome 

that  the  learned  Executing  Court  on  03.11.2021  issued 

direction to concerned authorities to block the petitioner’s 

CNIC, passport and SIMs.   

3.  Learned  counsel  for  petitioner  contends  that  the 

learned Executing Court has no authority to issue direction 

for  blocking  of  petitioner’s  CNIC  or  for  that  matter,  the 

passport  and  SIMs,  as  such,  the  directions  are  entirely  in 

contravention  to  the  settled  principles  of  law,  even 

otherwise, 

the 

learned  Executing  Court  has  not 

appreciated the overall facts and circumstances of the case, 

rather  passed  the  impugned  orders  in  haste  causing 

miscarriage of justice.  

4.  Arguments heard, record perused.   

5.  Perusal of record reveals that the petitioner is mainly 

aggrieved with the orders dated 22.10.2021 and 03.11.2021, 

passed by the learned Senior Civil Judge / Guardian Judge 

(East)  Islamabad  in  execution  of  decree,  whereby  the 

learned  Executing  Court  has  issued  direction  to  the 

NADRA  authorities  to  block  the  petitioner’s  CNIC,  even 

the  D.G.  Immigration  and  Passport  was  directed  to  block 

the  passport  issued  in  petitioner’s  name,  per  se,  direction 

was also issued to D.G. Enforcement (Wireless-II), PTA for 

blocking of all SIMs issued in his name. 

6.  When  confronted,  learned  counsel  for  petitioner 

contends  that  a  decree  of  maintenance  has  been  passed 

against  the  petitioner,  which  has  been  upheld  up  to  this 

 
 
W.P. No.4401/2021 

 Page-3 

Court  vide  judgment  dated  15.04.2021,  passed  in  W.P. 

No.3150/2020  (Muhammad  Asif  Khan  v.  Nadia  Khalil,  etc.), 

whereby  the  claim  of  maintenance  of  Rs.15,000/-  was 

reduced to Rs.5,000/- per month with 10% annual increase 

till subsistence of marriage. However, despite reduction in 

the  maintenance  the  said  amount  was  never  paid  by  the 

petitioner,  even  otherwise,  the  petitioner  has  no  proof  of 

payment to demonstrate his bona fide, especially when the 

initial decree was passed on 14.02.2020 w.e.f. 25.08.2013 i.e. 

date of marriage. 

7. 

In such scenario, the discretionary relief could not be 

granted  in  favour  of  petitioner,  who  is  not  interested  to 

satisfy  the  decree  of  the  maintenance  or  other  directions 

passed by the learned Judge Family Court, even in appeal 

he was directed to handover all dowry articles, as such, the 

conduct  demonstrated  by 

the  petitioner 

is  highly 

objectionable as he is using dilatory tactics with the aim to 

drag respondent No.1 into superfluous litigation, rather he 

is not showing any positive sign to satisfy the decree. 

8. 

In view of above circumstances, the learned Executing 

Court  had  no  other  option  but  to  proceed  against  the 

petitioner  with  the  help  of  modern  concepts,  including 

blocking  of  CNIC,  SIMs  and  passport,  if  any,  though  in 

next  stage  other  modes  of  recovery,  including  but  not 

limited  to  issuance  of  warrant  of  arrest,  are also  available 

to the learned Executing Court.  

9.  Manifestly, the learned counsel for petitioner has not 

been able to demonstrate any justiciable reason for setting

aside the impugned orders, especially when the judgment 

and  decree  has  attained  finality  in  earlier  round  of 

proceedings,  therefore,  the  instant  writ  petition  is  hereby 

DISMISSED in limine having no force.
