The  petitioner,  Ch.  Muhammad 

Rafique  son  of  Muhammad  Hussain,  seeks  bail 

before  arrest 

in  case  F.l.R.  No.46,  dated 

18.02.2020,  under  Sections  324,  109,  34 

P.P.C.,  Police  Station 

Shahzad 

Town, 

Islamabad. 

2. 

The  case of the  prosecution  against 

the  petitioner 

is  that  on  the  complaint  of 

respondent  No.2,  the  above-mentioned  F.l.R. 

was  registered; 

it  is  alleged  in  the  F.l.R.  that 

the  complainant  on  11.02.2020  at  about 

09: 10  P.M.  was  going  home  in  taxi,  when  he 

was 

intercepted  by 

two  unknown  persons 

riding  motorcycle,  who  fired  at  him  and  he 

Criminal  Miscellaneous  No.209/B  of  2020 

I  2 

received  one  bullet  in  his  stomach  and  the 

other  in  the  arm.  It  was  also  stated  that  he 

can  identify  the  persons.  The  complainant  also 

alleged  that  the  reason  for  attack  on  him  is 

that  his  elder  brother  and  his  brother  in  law 

i.e.  the  petitioner  have  family  disputes  and  in 

the  Jirga  convened  by 

the 

family, 

the 

petitioner  threatened  the  complainant. 

3. 

The  petitioner  applied 

for  bail 

before  arrest,  which  was  dismissed  by  the 

learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge 

(East), 

Islamabad,  vide  order  dated  16.03.2020. 

4. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contended  that 

there 

is  delay  of 

about  seven  days  in  lodging  of  the  F.I.R., 

which  is  not  explained; 

that 

the  only  role 

attributed  to  the  petitioner  in  the  F.I.R.  is  of 

abetment  under  Section  109  P.P.C.  It  was 

further  contended 

that 

the  allegations  as 

levelled  in  the  F.I.R.  are  baseless  and  based 

on  malafide. 

5. 

Learned  State  Counsel  alongwith 

counsel 

for 

the 

complainant, 

inter-etie, 

contended  that  there  is  no  delay  in  lodging  of 

the  F.I.R.  inasmuch  as  on  11.02.2020,  an 

application  was  made 

to 

the  hospital 

authorities  for  recording  of  the  statement  of 

the  complainant  but  due  to  the  endorsement 

by 

the 

relevant  Medical  Officer 

that 

the 

Criminal  Miscellaneous  No.209/B  of  2020 

I  3 

complainant  is not  fit  for  statement  the  matter 

was  deferred.  It  was  further  contended  that 

on  18.02.2020  application  was  made  again, 

which  was  allowed  and  only 

then 

the 

statement  of complainant  was taken  down  and 

on  the  basis thereof  the  F.l.R.  was  registered. 

It  was  contended  that  the  statements  have 

been  made  during  the  course  of  investigation 

by  Mst.  Ishtiaq,  wife  of  the  petitioner  and  the 

brother  of 

the  petitioner 

confirming 

the 

position 

that 

in 

the  Jirga 

the  petitioner 

threatened  the  complainant.  It  was  contended 

that 

the  police  authorities 

required 

the 

petitioner 

for 

further 

investigation 

in 

the 

matter 

inasmuch  as 

the  whereabouts  of 

persons,  who  carried  out  the  attack  are  not 

known.  It  was further  contended  that  the  case 

of  the  petitioner  does  not 

fall  within 

the 

parameters  of  bail  before  arrest  in  light  of  the 

recent 

pronouncement 

of 

the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  case reported  as 

"Gu/shan Ali  Solangi  and  others  VS  The State 

through  P.G. Sindh"  (2020  SCMR 249). 

6. 

Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

the  documents  placed  on  record  examined 

with  their  able assistance. 

7. 

The  thrust  of  the  arguments  by the 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  for  seeking 

Criminal  Miscellaneous  No.209/B of2020  14 

bail  before  arrest  was  that  there  is  a  delay  of 

about  seven  days  in  lodging  of  the  F.I.R.  In 

this  behalf,  the  learned  State  Counsel  placed 

on  record  the  request  made  by  the  police 

authorities  to  the  Pakistan  Institute  of  Medical 

Sciences 

(PIMS) 

for 

recording 

of 

the 

statement  of  the  complainant  on  12.02.2020 

at  about  12:30  A.M.;  whereupon,  the  relevant 

Medical  Officer  turned  down  the  same  on  the 

ground  that 

the  complainant 

is  not  fit 

for 

statement.  It  is  pertinent  to  observe  that  the 

alleged  incident 

is  of  11.02.2020  at  about 

09: 10  P.M. The  request  was  made  again  for 

recording  of  the  statement  on  18.02.2020, 

which  was  allowed  by  the  hospital  authorities 

whereupon  statement  of  the  complainant  was 

taken  and  on  the  basis  thereof  the  F.I. R.  was 

lodged. 

8. 

In  view  of  the  referred  facts  and 

circumstances,  no  delay  can  be  attributed  to 

the  complainant 

in  approaching 

the  police 

authorities  or 

recoding  of 

the  F.I.R.  The 

petitioner  has failed  to  point  out  any  malafide 

or  ulterior  motives  on  part  of  the  complainant 

or  the  police  authorities  seeking  his  arrest. 

The 

remedy  of  bail  before  arrest 

is  an 

extraordinary 

remedy  and  is  to  be  granted 

only  to  prevent  the  humiliation  of  arrest  to  an 

innocent  person;  it  is  not  granted  to  hamper 

Criminal  Miscellaneous  No.209/B of2020  I  S 

the  investigation  of  the  criminal  case.  Reliance 

is  placed  on  "Gulshan  Ali  Solangi  and  others 

VS  The  State 

through  P. G.  Sindh"  (2020 

SCMR 249). 

9. 

In  view  of  the  above  position,  the 

instant  petition 

is  without  merit  and 

is 

accordingly  dismissed.
