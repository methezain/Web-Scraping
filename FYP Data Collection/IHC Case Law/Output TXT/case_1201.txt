expects  that  the  said  person  will  be  produced 

before this Court on the next date of hearing.

In  the  event  that  respondent  No.3  is 

unable  to  locate  the  missing  person  (i.e. 

Yaseen S/o Rasheed Ahmed) and  produce  him 

in  the  Court  on  04.08.2021,  respondent  No.  2 

will  appear  in  person  on  such  date  and  report 

what  efforts  have  been  made  by  Islamabad 

Police to locate the whereabouts of the missing 

citizen.  The Office is directed to send a copy of 

this  order  to  respondent  No.2  as  well  as 

respondent No.1 for compliance.
