her rather they have left the house of the petitioner 

with  their  free  will  and  came  to  her  due  to  ill 

treatment and harsh behavior of the petitioner, her 

second  wife  and  their  step  brother.  She  further 

stated 

that  she  has  not  contracted  second 

marriage,  as  alleged  by  the  petitioner,  for  the 

welfare  and  future  of  her  children.  Respondent 

Nos.  2  &  3  /  alleged  abductees,  who  look  relax 

and  comfortable  with  their  mother,  also  affirmed 

the  facts  narrated  by  their  mother  /  Respondent 

No.1  and expressed their willingness to live  with 

their mother/Respondent No.1. 

3. 

The  petitioner  has  filed  instant  petition 

seeking  recovery  of  the  Respondent  Nos.  2  &  3, 

allegedly 

from 

the 

illegal  custody  of 

the 

Respondent  No.1/real  mother,  as  she,  as  per 

agreement/Mubarat  Deed  dated  25.09.2019, 

signed  by 

the  parties 

at 

the 

time  of 

pronouncement  of  Talaq,  agreed that  Respondent 

Nos.  2  &  3  were  to  be  remained  in  petitioner’s 

custody,  whereas,  their  younger  daughter  was 

given  in  the  custody  of  the  Respondent  No.1  for 

two years. In this regard, it is pertinent to mention 

here  that  as  per  settled  law,  even  if  either  of  the 

parents surrenders the custody of a minor in favor 

of  other  party,  even  then  he/she  cannot  be 

deprived of his/her right of custody of the minor. 

Reliance in this regard can safely be placed on an 

unreported  judgment  of  Hon’ble  Apex  Court 

passed  in  case  titled  as  Mst.  Beena  VS Raj 

Muhammad, etc. (C.P.No. 4129/2019).  

4.  As  the  alleged  abductees/minor  children 

have  been  produced  before  the  Court,  who  are

living with their real mother/Respondent No.1 and 

both  are  willing  to  go  with  her,  therefore,  no 

useful  purpose  would  be 

served 

through 

proceeding further with the matter, hence, present 

petition is hereby dismissed, accordingly.
