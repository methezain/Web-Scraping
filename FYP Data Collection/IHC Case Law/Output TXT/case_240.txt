ARBAB  MUHAMMAD  TAHIR  J:  Through  the  instant  writ  petition, 

petitioner namely Faisal Mehmood (defendant in main suit) impugns Orders 

and Decrees dated  21.12.2021 and 12.01.2022, passed by the learned Judge 

Family  Court  and  the  learned  Additional  District  Judge-I  Islamabad 

respectively,  whereby  in  suit  for  the  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance 

and gold ornaments filed by respondent 3 to 5 (plaintiffs in the main suit), the 

defence of the petitioner was closed in terms of Section 17-A of the Family 

Courts Act, 1964 (“Act of 1964”)  and pursuant thereto, suit to the extent of 

minors (respondent 4 & 5) was decreed in terms that the said respondents 

were held entitled to recover Rs. 15,000/- per month each with effect from 

October,  2020  till  their  legal  entitlement  along  with  10  percent  annual 

increase, while appeal was dismissed in limine.  

2.  Tersely, on 26.03.2021 respondents 3 to 5 filed a suit for the recovery 

of maintenance allowance and gold ornaments against the petitioner. As per 

the  averments  of  the  said  suit,  the  marriage  between  petitioner  and  the 

respondents  No.  3  Mst.  Nazia  Zardad  lasted  for  about  9  years  and 

ultimately  led  to  divorce  in  September,  2020.  Out  of  the  wedlock, 

respondents 4 and 5 namely Hassan and Hasnain, aged about 5 and 8 years 

respectively  were  born  and  now  are  studying  in  Nursery  and  Class-III.  In 

response  to  notice,  petitioner  entered  appearance.  Pre-trial  reconciliation 

proceedings could  not  succeed as  reveals through order  dated 03.11.2021, 

after  framing  necessary  issues,  the  case  was  set  for  recording  evidence 

while  at  the  same  time  the  petitioner  was  directed  to  pay  interim

maintenance  to  the  minors/respondents  4  &  5  @  of  Rs.  5000/-  per  month 

each  with  effect from  the date of that order, or else right of  the petitioner 

would  be  closed.  On  the  subsequent  date  27.11.2021,  on  failure  of  the 

petitioner  to  appear,  he  was  preceded  against  ex-parte.  However,  ex-parte 

order was subsequently recalled, on the application of the petitioner subject 

to  payment  of  Rs.  3000/-  and  the  case  was  adjourned  to  21.12.2021  for 

cross examination of respondent No. 3 and  payment of entire outstanding 

interim  maintenance  and  the  cost  imposed  as  well.  On  21.12.2021,  the 

learned Judge Family Court passed the following order:- 

“Today suit was fixed for cross examination over plaintiff and 
complete  payment  of  interim  maintenance  by  defendant  and 
cost, defendant did not appear in person for complete payment 
of  interim  maintenance  only  his  proxy  counsel  present  and 
requested time on the other hand counsel for plaintiffs resisted 
the  request  of  proxy  counsel  for  defendant  and  requested  to 
decree  the  suit  to  the  extent  of  maintenance  of  minors  by 
applying section 17-A of Family Courts Act.

that  on  03.11.2021 

Perusal  of 
interim 
maintenance  of  plaintiffs  No.  2  &  3  was  fixed  @  Rs.  5,000/-
per month each, later on defendant has not paid single penny of

defendant on 04.12.2021 but he failed, moreover defendant did

W.P. No. 723-2022 

3. 

It is significant to note that as per the initial direction vide order dated 

03.11.2021,  the  petitioner  was  directed  to  pay  interim  maintenance  of  the 

two  minors@  Rs.  5000/-  per  month  each  with  effect  from  that  date  i.e. 

03.11.2021,  however,  subsequently  through  the  order  ibid,  petitioner  was 

directed  to  pay  maintenance  @  of  Rs.  15000/-  per  month  to  each  minor 

w.e.f.  October,  2020  till  their  legal  entitlement.  By  the  said  order,  the 

defence of the petitioner was closed in terms of section 17-A of the Act of 

1964 and the suit was decreed to the extent of maintenance allowance of the 

two minors. There is no mention about the claim and the financial status of 

the  petitioner  on  the  basis  of  which  the  respondents  claimed  maintenance 

allowance as prayed for while the version of the petitioner asserted through 

written-statement  was  also  not  taken  into  consideration.  There  was 

absolutely  no  observation  with  regard  to  financial  status  of  the  petitioner 

and the  grounds made basis to claim the maintenance allowance @ of Rs. 

30,000/- per month by the respondents  

4.  The  petitioner  assailed  the  order  in  appeal  but  it  was  dismissed  in 

limine  by  the  learned  ADJ-I  Islamabad  East  vide  order  dated  12.01.2022, 

hence instant writ petition.  

5. 

Learned counsel argued that the quantum of maintenance determined 

and fixed does not commensurate with the financial status of petitioner, who 

is a class-IV  employee with  monthly  salary  of Rs.  24740/-, has to pay  Rs. 

2666-31 as monthly installment to the NBP for settling the loan and that out 

of the remaining salary, has also to maintain his ailing father besides other 

family members and to pay the house rent. According to the learned counsel, 

the  petitioner  has  no  other  source  of  income,  a  member  of  a  joint  family 

while  on  the  other  hand,  the  minors  are  of  tender  age  studying  in  Nursery 

and class-3; that the procedure envisaged in section 17-A & B of the West 

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  was  not  followed  and  the  suit  was 

decreed  as  prayed  for.  Further  argued  that  the  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees,  being  against  the  law  and  facts  are  liable  to  be  set  aside.  Learned 

counsel relied upon case law reported as 2018 MLD 785 & 2018 CLC 1761.

W.P. No. 723-2022 

6.  On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondents  argued  that  the 

petitioner is deliberately avoiding payment of maintenance, failed to pay the 

interim  maintenance  and  left  the  minors  unattended  and  that  the  rate  of 

maintenance  allowance  determined  and  fixed  in  no  way  can  be  termed 

excessive  and  is  at  par  with  the  needs  of  the  two  minors  who  are  being 

imparted  with  education.  Learned  counsel  in  this  respect  placed  on  record 

the receipts of payment of school fee of the two minors. 

7.  Heard, record perused.  

8. 

It  is  settled  principle  that  the  father  is  legally  and  morally  bound  to 

maintain  his  children  wherever  they  are  residing  according  to  their  needs 

and,  of  course,  as  per  his  financial  capability.  An  interim  order  for 

maintenance is governed by Section 17-A of the Act of 1964 which reads as 

under:- 

“17A.  Interim  order  for  maintenance: At  any  stage  of 
proceedings  in  a  suit  for  maintenance,  the Family Court  may 
pass an interim order for maintenance, whereunder the payment 
shall  be  made  by  the  fourteenth  of  each  month,  failing  which 
the  Court  may  strike  off  the defence of  the  defendant  and 
decree the suit.” 

9.  As  per  Section  17A  ibid,  in  case  of  failure  of  the  defendant  to  pay 

interim maintenance, the Court may strike off the defence of the defendant 

and decree the suit. The provision is directory in nature. Reliance is placed 

upon case of Khurram Shahzad v. Naseem Akhtar and others ( 2021 CLC 

1300-Islamabad ), Bashrat Ali v. ADJ Multan and others (2018 MLD 785-

Lahore),  

10.  Under  the  principle,  the  Court  before  passing  the  decree  has  to 

examine the claim of the plaintiffs/respondents, the needs of the minor and 

the  financial  capacity  of  the  petitioner  to  pay  the  maintenance  allowance. 

Before  reaching  at  any  conclusion  on  the  question  of  quantum  of 

maintenance to be determined, it is obligatory for the Court to undertake the 

said  exercise  as  the  authority  bestowed  under  the  provision  warrants  due 

application of mind and judicial dispensation. Not only this but in  order to 

undertake  such  exercise  the  Court  may  examine  any  person,  make  a  local 

investigation and inspect any property or document. Reliance is placed upon 

 
5 

W.P. No. 723-2022 

case of Shahzad  Hussain v. Judge Family Court and Others ( 2011 CLC 

820-Lahore). 

11.  On  examination  of  the  record,  it  reveals  that  the  claim  of  the 

respondents  as  reveals  through  paragraph  No.  7  had  been  that  “the 

defendant  is  serving  a  Government  Job  and  also  running  his  business  of 

property  and  he  is  earning  an  amount  of  Rs.  2  lac  so  can  easily  pay  the 

maintenance  to  the  plaintiffs”.  The  petitioner,  on  the  other  hand,  in 

paragraph 6 of the written statement had taken the stance that he is a poor 

man working as Naib Qasid in AGPR with monthly salary of Rs. 24740, out 

of which Rs. 2666 are deducted for repayment of loan and by the remaining 

salary,  he  has  to  pay  utility  billsand  to  maintain  his  family  members 

including ailing  father. The learned Judge Family Court before passing the 

decree has to examine the claim of the respondents, the needs of the minors 

and  the  financial  capacity  of  the  petitioner  to  pay  the  maintenance 

allowance. For doing the needful, it is mandatory for the Court to decide the 

issue  with  due  application  of  mind  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of 

natural justice, fair play and equity and for the purpose it may also undertake 

local  investigation  and  may  summon  and  examine  any  person,  as  deemed 

appropriate.  It  is  obvious  that  the  said  exercise  was  not  undertaken  by  the 

learned trial Court and the learned appellate Court also omitted to consider 

this aspect of the matter. The proceedings of the Family Court, whether it be 

a  Trial  Court  or  an  Executing  Court,  are  governed  by  the  principles  of 

equity, justice and fair play as laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in case 

of “Haji Muhammad Nawaz v Samina Kanwal”(2017 SCMR 321). 

12.  On the other hand, the conduct demonstrated by the petitioner appears 

to  be  not  aboveboard,  as  he  has  not  paid  any  interim  maintenance  to  his 

minor children at the rate determined by the learned Trial Court vide order 

dated 03.11.2021, therefore, in order to show his bonafide and commitment 

to maintain his children, he shall have to pay adequate maintenance to both 

the minors, or else cannot be held entitle to ask for equitable relief as who 

seeks equity must come with clean hands.

W.P. No. 723-2022 

13. 

In view of above,impugned orders and decrees are set aside subject to 

payment  of  half  of  the  entire  outstanding  interim  maintenance  by  the 

petitioner  pursuant  to  order  dated  03.11.2021at  the  rate  so  determined  by 

that  order,  in  case  the  petitioner  fails  to  pay  half  of  the  entire  outstanding 

interim maintenance, the instant writ petition shall be deemed to have been 

dismissed by upholding the impugned orders. In case the petitioner complies 

with the order, the learned Judge Family Court shall proceed with the case 

from  the  stage  where  it  had  been  before  passing  of  the  order  dated 

21.12.2021,  i.e.  cross  examination  upon  plaintiff.  The  petitioner  shall  also 

continue  to  pay  monthly  interim  maintenance  to  the  minors,  pending 

decision  of  the  main  case,  in  terms  of  order  dated  03.11.2021. The  instant 

writ petition is disposed of accordingly. 

14.  Before  parting  with  the  order,  it  is  necessary  to  mention  that  the 

parties  are  in  contest  in  a  suit  under  the  Act  of  1964  which  warrants 

expeditious  disposal  as  for  the  purpose,  provisions  of  Quanun-e-Shahadat 

Order  1984  (P.O.  No.10  of  1984)  and  the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure  except 

Sections 10  and 11 have been excluded to achieve the legislative intent.  A

specific  timeframe  of  six  months  has  been  provided  for  the  decision  of  a 

case  under  the  Act  of  1964  in  terms  of  Section  12(A)  of  the  Act  of  1964 

while period of four months is stipulated under Section 14(A) of the Act of 

1964 for decision of an appeal. The suit was filed in March, 2021 and has 

not yet reached to final conclusion despite lapse of more than one and half 

year  which  under  the  law,  had  to  be  concluded  within  a  period  of  six 

months.  Therefore,  the  learned  trial  Court  shall  make  every  endeavor  to

conclude  the  proceedings  of  the  trial  at  the  earliest  preferably  within  a 

period of two months from the receipt of this order.  Copy of this order be 

sent to the learned trial Court for compliance.
