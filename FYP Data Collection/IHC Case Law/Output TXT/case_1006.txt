misreading and non-reading of evidence and 

caused  miscarriage  of 

justice;  that  the 

learned  Trial  Court  while  passing 

the 

impugned  judgment  and  decree  has  ignored 

the  facts  of  the  case  and  the  dictums  laid 

down  by  the  superior  courts  of  the  country, 

both  the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
are erroneous and are not tenable under the 

law,  hence  the  same  are  liable  to  be  set-

aside.
