Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or counsel 
where necessary.  

for 

the 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition,  the 

petitioner,  Ziafat  Mehmood  Abbasi,  impugns 

the  judgment  and  decree  dated  21.10.2021, 

passed  by  the  Court  of  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge,  Islamabad  (East),  whereby  his 

appeal  against  the  order  dated  20.10.2020 

passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

was dismissed as without any merit. Vide order 

dated  20.10.2020,  the  learned  Family  Court 

had closed the petitioner's right of defence and 

suit  of  respondent  No.3  to  the  extent  of 

maintenance  for  minors  /  respondents  No.  4 

and  5  was  decreed  under  Section  17-A  of  the 

West  Pakistan  Family  Court  Act,  1964  ("the 

1964 Act").  

2.  

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submitted  that  the  petitioner  was  employed 

abroad  in  a  hotel  which  was  closed  due  to 

Covid-19  pandemic;  that  the  petitioner  had 

been facing financial problems since then; that 

after  his  return  to  Pakistan,  he  got  a  job  at  an 

organization  called  Zameen.com  where  his 

monthly  salary  is  Rs.37,158/-;  that  respondent 

No.3  had  admitted  the  salary  of  the  petitioner 

to  be  his  only  source  of  income;  that  prior  to 

the  outbreak  of  Covid-19,  the  petitioner  had 

been  paying  the  interim  maintenance  for  the 

two minors at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month

  W.P.No.3951/2021 

each as per order of the learned Judge Family 

Court;  that  after  becoming  unemployed  the 

petitioner  moved  an  application  for  reduction 

of  the  maintenance which was  rejected  by  the 

learned  Family  Court  vide  order  dated 

15.09.2020;  that  while  passing  the  impugned 

judgment  and  decree  20.10.2020,  the  learned 

Family  Court 

enhanced 

the  monthly 

maintenance  allowance  for  the  two  minors 

from Rs.20,000/- to Rs.30,000/- which is nearly 

equal  to  the  petitioner’s  monthly  income;    that 

the  learned  Courts  below  did  not  take  into 

account  the  current  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner;  that  mother  of  the  children  i.e. 

respondent No.3 has sufficient financial means 

as  she 

is  employed  at  Sui  Northern  Gas 

Company  Limited;  that  the  petitioner  had 

previously  purchased  a  plot  in  the  name  of 

respondent  No.3  which  he  had  now  asked  her 

to  sell 

to  accumulate 

finances,  but  she 

refused;  and  that  impugned  judgments  and 

decrees  are  violative  of  law.  In  making  his 

submissions, learned counsel for the petitioner 

placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble 

Supreme Court reported  as  PLD 2018 SC 819. 

Learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for 

the  writ  petition  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the 

relief sought therein. 

3. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  have 

perused the record with his able assistance.  

4. 

The  record  shows  that  on  14.09.2020, 

the petitioner filed an application for reduction 

of  the  interim  maintenance  allowance  fixed  by 

the  learned  Family  Court.  The  said  application 

was  dismissed  vide  order  dated  15.09.2020. 

The  petitioner  assailed  the  said  order  dated 

3 

  W.P.No.3951/2021 

15.09.2020 

before 

this 

Court 

in 

W.P.No.2774/2020  which  was  dismissed  in 

limine  vide  order  dated  30.09.2020  with  the 

following observations:- 

“5. Record reveals that interim maintenance 
allowance of the two minors was fixed at the 
rate  of  Rs.10,000/-  per  month  each  in 
September, 2019 and the petitioner paid the 
same for initial six months till February 2O2O 
and thereafter came-up with the application 
for  reduction  of  the  interim maintenance 
after six months.  lt is manifest  from  the 
record  that  he  requested  for  waiver  of 
interim  maintenance  for  a  period  of  six 
months.  During  the  said  period,  the 
petitioner did not pay even Rs.5000/- per 
month as he prayed through the instant writ 
petition  in  terms  of  maintenance  to  the 
minors to show his readiness and left the 
minors unattended in those hard days which 
cannot  be  considered  as  an  excuse  to 
absolve  him  from  his  duty.  lt  is  settled 
principle that it is the bounden duty of the 
father to maintain his children irrespective 
of the fact that they are residing with their 
mother.” 
(Emphasis added) 

5. 

Despite  dismissal  of  his  earlier  writ 

petition by this Court, the petitioner did not pay 

the 

interim  maintenance  and  obtained 

adjournments  from  learned  Family  Court  on 

the  account  of  the  pendency  of  writ  petition 

before  this  Court.  He  had  also  not  annexed 

with  the  instant  petition  a  copy  of  the  order 

dated  30.09.2020  passed  in  writ  petition  No. 

2774/2020.  

6. 

Perusal  of  the  interlocutory  order  dated 

06.10.2020  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge 

Family  Court  shows  that  the  petitioner  did  not 

disclose the fact of dismissal of his earlier writ 

petition.  However,  in  the  said  order  dated 

06.10.2020, the learned Family Court observed 

that  since  the  petitioner  did  not  produce 

copies  of  an  injunctive  order  passed  by  this 

Court,  he  shall  pay  the  interim  maintenance 

 
 
4 

  W.P.No.3951/2021 

failing  which  the  suit  would  be  decreed  under 

Section 17-A  of the 1964 Act. Despite the said 

notice under Section 17-A of the 1964 Act, the 

petitioner  did  not  pay 

the  maintenance 

allowance,  therefore,  the  suit  was  decreed  in 

terms  of  the  impugned  judgment  and  decree 

dated  20.10.2020  to the extent  of respondents 

No.4 and 5 / plaintiffs No.2 and 3. In the plaint, 

the  private  respondents  claimed  maintenance 

for  the  minors  at  the  rate  of  Rs.20,000/-  each 

however,  the  learned  Family  Court  took  a 

lenient  view  and  decreed 

the  monthly 

maintenance at the rate of Rs.15,000/- each.  

7. 

Now,  since  the  petitioner  did  not  show 

compliance  with  the  order  for  the  payment  of 

interim  maintenance 

to 

the  minors 

/ 

respondents  No.4  and  5,  the  learned  Family 

Court  did  not  commit  any  jurisdictional  error 

by invoking the penal provision of Section 17-A 

of  the  1964  Act  against  the  petitioner.  Even 

otherwise  given  the  inflation  at  this  day  and 

age,  the  maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned 

Family Court for the petitioner’s own two minor 

children  is  just  and  reasonable.  The  case  law 

cited at bar pertains to distinct question of law 

and  facts  and  in  the  present  case  statutory 

provision  of  Section  17-A  of  the  1964  Act  is 

involved. 

8. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  petition 

is dismissed in limine.
