Barrister  Waqas  Aziz  Qureshi,  Mr  Imaan  Zainab  Hazir, 
Advocate for petitioner.  

The petitioner is father of two minors, 

namely  Amal  and  Abram  who  are  five  and 

six  years  old,  respectively.  The  minors  are 

nationals  of  the  United  States  of  America.  

It  is  the  case  of  the  petitioner  that  marital 

disputes  between  him  and  respondent  no.5 

i.e.  Zahida  Malik  alias  Veena  Malik  were 

pending  before  the  competent  court  in 

Dubai,  United  Arab  Emirates.  It  is  asserted 

that the court at Dubai vide order, dated 18-

04-2018,  had  restrained  taking  out  the  two 

minors from its jurisdiction. The petitioner is 

aggrieved  because  he  asserts  that  officials 

of  respondents  no.1  to  4  and  the  Pakistan 

Mission  in  Dubai  were  complacent  in  the 

illegal  abduction  of  the  minors  i.e.  his 

children and their travel to Pakistan. He has 

further  alleged 

that 

the  officials  of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
respondents  no.1  to  4  have  through  their 

acts  and  omissions  exposed  themselves  to 

be  proceeded  against  under  the  relevant 

laws.  

2. 

The  learned  counsel  has,  inter  alia, 

contended  that  the  fundamental  rights  of 

the  petitioner  as  well  as  the  minors  have 

been  violated  and 

that 

there 

is  an 

apprehension  regarding  the  well  being  and 

safety of the latter.  

3. 

Let 

notice 

be 

issued 

to 

the 

respondents  for  filing  report  and  para-wise 

comments within a fortnight.

which according to the petitioner had passed 

a restraining order.
