AAMER FAROOQ J.    This 

order 

shall dispose of instant writ petition as well as 

W.P. No.1772-2021 & W.P. No.1773-2021, as 

they  assail  orders  dated  01.10.2020  & 

22.04.2021 

passed 

by 

the 

Judge, 

Accountability Court-III, Islamabad. 

2. 

The  petitioners  claim 

to  be 

the 

claimants  with  respect  to  properties  which 

were  attached  by  the  orders  of  the  Judge, 

Accountability Court-III, Islamabad owned by 

Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz  Sharif,  who  was 

declared ‘proclaimed offender’ by the referred 

court  in  Reference  No.6  of  2020  pending 

before it. In this behalf, the petitioner in W.P. 

No.1770-2021,  claims  to  have  purchased  the 

agricultural land measuring 88-kanals 4-marlas 

  
 
 
 
W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc. 

2 

situated 

in  Mouza  Ferozwatan  District 

Sheikhupura  through  agreement  to  sell  and 

has  filed  a  suit  for  specific  performance  with 

respect  to  said  land,  which  is  pending  before 

Civil Court of Sheikhupura. The petitioner, in 

W.P.  No.1772-2021,  claims  to  be  the  owner 

of  property  bearing  No.135-Upper  Mall, 

Lahore  as  having  acquired  the  same  through 

Family 

Settlement 

Agreement 

dated 

06.04.2014;  the  petitioner,  in  W.P.  No.1773-

2021,  claims  to  be  the  lessee,  who  obtained 

the  property  known  as  ‘Shamim  Zari  Farm’ 

comprising  of  65-acres  on  lease/patta  and 

made investments.    

3. 

Learned counsel for the petitioners inter 

alia  contended 

that  vide  order  dated 

01.10.2020,  the  properties 

in  which  the 

petitioners  have  interest,  were  ordered  to  be 

attached,  however,  said  order  of  attachment, 

was  not  properly  made  in  light  of  section 

88(2) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898; in 

this  behalf,  learned  counsel  pointed  out  that 

under  the  referred  provision,  the  Sessions 

Judge  of  the  District,  in  which,  the  property 

sought  to  be  attached  is  situated,  has  to 

endorse the attachment, which was not done. 

It  was  contended  that  in  view  of  referred 

position, the process of attachment is illegal in 

light  of  judgment  reported  as  ‘Ganu  Shukul 

and  others  VS  Emperor’  [AIR  1930  Patna 

347(1)].  It  was 

further  contended 

that 

properties, 

in  question,  are 

immovable 

properties,  hence  were  to  be  attached  in 

 
W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc. 

3 

accordance  with  section  88(4)  ibid,  which 

again, was not done. Learned counsel pointed 

out  that  petitioner  in  W.P.  No.1770-2021,  is 

the purchaser of land measuring 88-kanals and 

his claim, for specific performance, is pending 

in 

the  court  of  competent 

jurisdiction. 

Likewise,  it  was  contended  that  petitioner  in 

W.P.  No.1772-2021,  acquired  the  property 

through  family  settlement  and  the  petitioner 

in  W.P.  No.1773-2021, 

is  the 

lessee  of 

property  known  as  ‘Shamim  Zari  Farm’, 

hence  petitioners  are  claimants,  who  have 

interest  in  the  properties  attached,  therefore, 

the attachment order needs to be set aside. It 

was  added  that  under  section  88(7)  ibid,  the 

property  is  being  auctioned/sold  in  violation 

of law.  

4. 

In  response  to  the  query  of  the  Court, 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  submitted 

that  no  objections  were 

filed,  as 

the 

petitioners  did  not  come  to  know  about  the 

attachment  order. 

In 

support  of  his 

contentions,  learned  counsel  placed  reliance 

on  cases  reported  as  ‘B.K.  Shaikh  VS  The 

State  and  others’  (1985  SCMR  1291)  and 

‘Naila Tranum Jamshed VS Haji Muhammad 

Abbas and 4-others’ (2001 SCMR 383).  

5. 

In  response  to  another  query  of  the 

Court, 

learned 

counsel 

submitted 

that 

auction/sale is being conducted in accordance 

with  procedure  provided  in  Lahore  High 

Court  Rules  and  Orders,  which  are  being 

followed by this Court as well.  

W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc.

6. 

Arguments 

advanced 

by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioners  have  been  heard 

and 

the  documents,  placed  on 

record, 

examined with his able assistance.  

7. 

The  facts,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petitions,  have  been  mentioned  hereinabove, 

therefore,  need  not  be  reproduced,  however, 

it  is  added  that  Mian  Muhammad  Nawaz 

Sharif  was  declared  ‘proclaimed  offender’  in 

Reference  No.6  of  2020  pending  before 

Judge, 

Accountability 

Court  No.III, 

Islamabad, hence under section 88 of Code of 

Criminal  Procedure,  1898 

(the  Code), 

respondent  No.1  proceeded  with  attachment 

of his  properties  and  did so  vide order dated 

01.10.2020.  With  respect  to  those  properties, 

where  no  objections  were  filed,  the  court 

ordered  the  sale/auction  of  the  same  vide 

order dated 22.04.2021. The properties, which 

are subject matter of the instant petitions, are 

included in the list of properties, with respect 

to which, orders for sale have been made.       

8. 

Under section 88 of the Code, the court 

issuing  the  proclamation  under  section  87 

ibid, may at any time, order the attachment of 

any property movable or immoveable or both 

belonging to the proclaimed person.  

9. 

Section  88(6A)  of  the  Code  provides 

for  the  right  to  challenge  any  attachment,  if 

any  person  has  any  claim  or  objection  made 

to 

the  attachment  with  respect 

to  any 

property, which has been attached and owned 

by  the  proclaimed  offender.  For  ease  of 

W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc. 

5 

convenience, 

relevant 

subsection 

is 

reproduced below:- 

“(6-A) 
If  any  claim  is  preferred  to,  or 
objection  made  to  the  attachment  of  any 
property attached under this section within six 
months  from  the  date  of  such  attachment,  by 
any  person  other  than  the  proclaimed  person, 
on the ground that the claimant or objector has 
an  interest  in  such  property,  and  that  such 
interest  is  not  liable  to  attachment  under  this 
section, the claim or objection shall be inquired 
into,  and  may  be  allowed  or  disallowed  in 
whole or in part; 

Provided  that  any  claim  preferred  or 
objection  made  within  the  period  allowed  by 
this subjection may, in the event of the death of 
the  claimant  or  objector,  be  continued  by  his 
legal representative”. 

The  bare  perusal  of  above  subsection  shows 

that  if  any person  has  any claim  with  respect 

to  attached  properties  or  objection  to  the 

attachment of the property, he/she can object 

to  it  within  six  months  from  the  date  of 

attachment,  however,  proclaimed  offender 

cannot 

challenge 

the 

attachment.  The 

grounds,  on  the  basis  of  which  attachment 

can be challenged, is that claimant or objector 

has  interest  in  such  property  and  that  such 

interest  is  not liable to  attachment  under  this 

section  and  claim  or  objection  is  to  be 

inquired  into  and/or  may  be  allowed  or 

disallowed  in  whole  or  in  part.  The  words 

used  in  subsection  (6-A)  ibid  are  ‘claim’  with 

respect  to  attached  properties  or  ‘objections’ 

made  to  the  attachment’,  hence  it  is  wide 

enough  to  cover  any  factual  challenge  to  the 

attachment  or  even  legal  attack  on  the  same. 

 
 
 
W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc. 

6 

The  claims  of  the  petitioners  are  not  only 

factual but legal as well, as are borne out from 

the  contentions  by  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioners, however, to cater such claims, the 

statute provides adequate relief and remedy by 

way 

of 

application 

before 

the 

court/Magistrate which passed the attachment 

orders.  Learned 

counsel,  when  was 

confronted  with  this  view  of  the  matter,  he 

candidly  acknowledged  the  availability  of 

remedy  but  submitted  that  it  has  become 

barred by limitation and when reason for the 

same was asked, he responded that petitioners 

did  not  have  the  knowledge  of  attachment 

order.  

10.  Be  that  as  it  may,  alternate,  adequate 

and  efficacious  remedy  is  available  to  the 

petitioners,  under  which,  the  petitioners  can 

challenge the attachment not only on the basis 

of  the  interest  they  have,  if  any,  in  the 

properties  in  question,  but  also  on  the  legal 

grounds.  Under  section  88(6-A)  ibid,  the 

Court  can  hold  an  inquiry  into  the  claim  of 

the  objector.  Moreover, 

the 

limitation 

provided  for  assailing  the  attachment,  is  six 

months from the date of attachment. It is not 

clear  from  the  record  appended  with  the 

petitions,  as  to  when,  attachment  was  made 

and  whether  the  remedy  of  petitioners  has 

become barred  by limitation.  The attachment 

order was passed on 01.10.2020, but when the 

attachment  was  made,  is  not  borne  out  from 

the 

available 

record.  Even-otherwise, 

W.P. Nos.1770-2021 etc. 

7 

limitation  starts  from  the  date  of  attachment 

and  one  of  the  grounds  of  the  petitioners  in 

the  instant  petitions,  is  that  attachment  has 

not been made in accordance with provisions 

of section 88 of the Code, hence question of 

limitation remains grey. 

11. 

Since the petitioners have alternate and 

adequate  remedy,  they  can  challenge  the 

attachment  by  way  of  that  remedy  provided 

under  section  88  (6-A)  ibid.  Learned  trial 

court, 

while 

deciding 

the 

applications/objections to the attachment, can 

also  advert  to  the  question  of  limitation;  the 

fact  that  alternate  and  adequate  remedy  has 

become barred by limitation, is no ground for 

assailing  the  order  of  attachment  by  way  of 

petitions 

under  Article 

199  of 

the 

Constitution.  

12. 

In view of above, petitioners may assail 

attachment  of  the  properties  in  accordance 

with process provided under section 88 (6-A) 

ibid and if such applications are made, learned 

trial  court  shall  decide  the  question  of 

limitation  as  well  in  accordance  with  the 

mandate of law.     

13.  For what has been stated above, instant 

petitions  are  not  maintainable,  hence  are 

dismissed in limine.
