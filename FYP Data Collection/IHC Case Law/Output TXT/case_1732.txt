PARTY  NO. 1,  BY: 

Mr Sajid Haider Malik Advocate. 

PARTY  NO. 2,  BY: 

Mr Muhammad Habib Ullah Khan Advocate. 

ATHAR  MINALLAH,  CJ.-  Through this  consolidated 

judgment,  I  shall  decide  the 

instant  petition  and  three 

connected petitions listed in  "Annexure-A"  attached hereto. 

2. 

The  facts,  in  brief,  are  that  Muhammad Sajid  Iqbal 

son  of  Muhammad  Iqbal  [hereinafter  referred  to  as  "Party 

no.  l"]  and  Ms  Saira  Parveen  daughter  of  Abdul  Khaliq 

[hereinafter  referred  to  as  "Party  no.  2"]  entered  into  a 

marriage  contract  on  16-12-2007.  They  were  blessed with  a 

daughter  namely,  Ms  Fatima Sajid  [hereinafter  referred to  as 

the "Minor"].  The Minor was born on 13-09-2009.  After  living 

for  some  time  together  the  parties  developed  differences 

which  led  to  filing  of  a  suit  by  Party  no.  2  on  19-11-2011, 

seeking  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance,  dowry  articles, 

i:tower  and  personal  belongings.  The  learned  Judge  Family 

W.P.  No. 4287  of  2017. 

2 

Court  partially  decreed the  suit  vide  judgment  and  decree, 

dated  18-03-2007.  The parties filed  their  respective appeals. 

The  appeal filed  by  Party  no.  2  was dismissed while  appeal 

filed  by  Party  no.  1  was partially  allowed. The  parties  have, 

therefore,  assailed through  constitutional  petitions judgments 

and  decrees, dated  18-03-2017  and  29-11-2017,  passed by 

the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  and  the  learned  appellate 

Court,  respectively.  Party  no.  2,  filed  a  suit  seeking  khula 

(dissolution  of  marriage)  and  the  same  was  decreed  vide 

order  and  decree,  dated  03-09-2014.  Through  W.P.  No. 

3110/2019,  Party  no.  2  has  sought  suspension  of  the 

execution  proceedings. In  W.P. No. 4288/2019,  Party  no.  1 

has assailed orders  and decrees, dated  29-03-2017  and  28- 

09-2017,  passed by the  learned Guardian Judge/Judge Family 

Court  and the  learned appellate Court  whereby  petition  filed 

under  section  25  of  the  Guardian  and  Wards  Act,  1890 

[hereinafter referred to as the "Act of  1890"]  was dismissed. 

3. 

The  learned  counsel  for  Party  no.  1  has  mainly 

argued  that  the  learned  Courts  were  not  competent  to 

adjudicate  the  matter  because both  the  parties  had  left  the 

country  and  had settled  in  the  United  Kingdom in  2010.  He 

has further  argued that  the  learned Courts have not  properly 

appraised the evidence. 

4. 

On the  other  hand, the  learned counsel for  Party no. 

2  has  argued  that  evidence  brought  on  record  was  not 

W.P.  No. 4287  of 2017. 

3 

properly  appreciated and,  therefore  the  claims made by  the 

latter were dismissed in a  perfunctory manner. 

5. 

The learned counsels for the parties have been heard 

and the  record perused with their able assistance. 

6. 

The marriage contract executed between the  parties 

and pursuant thereto  birth  of the  Minor are not disputed. The 

parties had been residing within the jurisdiction  of the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  at  Islamabad.  The  cause of  action  had 

also arisen at  Islamabad. The  learned counsels for  both  the 

parties,  despite  their  able  assistance,  were  not  able  to 

persuade this  Court that  the  learned Judge Family Court and 

the  learned  appellate  Court  had  misread the  evidence. The 

learned counsel for  Party no.  1  could not  persuade this  Court 

that  the  provisions of  the  Act  of  1890 or  the  West Pakistan 

Family Courts  Rules, 1965  have been misinterpreted  by  the 

learned Courts. While exercising jurisdiction  under Article 199 

of the  Constitution of the  Islamic  Republic of  Pakistan, 1973, 

this Court is  not required to reappraise the evidence. 

7. 

For  the  above  reasons, the  petitions  in  hand  are 

A 

devoid of merit and thus accordingly dismissed.
