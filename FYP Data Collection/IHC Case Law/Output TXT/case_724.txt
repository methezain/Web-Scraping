01 

07.02.2022  Ch. Muhammad Atif, Advocate.  

The  petitioner  prays  for  setting  aside  the  judgment 

dated  30.09.2021  and  order  dated  21.12.2021  passed 

respectively  by  the  family  court  and  the  appellate  court, 

and,  accordingly  for  a  direction  for  respondent  no.3  to 

return the dower of Rs.5,000/- and gold 6 tola.  

2 

Learned  counsel  submits  that  the  findings  of  the 

learned  appellate  court  in  paragraph  18  of  the  impugned 

order  that  the  gold  ornaments  were  given  as  a  gift  is 

incorrect  in  law  as  columns  no.13,  14  and  15  are 

specifically  allocated  for  entries  of  dower  only;  if  a  gift 

was  intended,  then  it  was  to  be  mentioned  in  column 

no.17.  He relies on a judgment of a Division Bench of the 

Lahore  High  Court  in  W.P  no.  2111/2013  in  this  behalf. 

He also refers to the cross-examination of respondent no.3 

where  an  admission  was  made  that  the  gift  in  question 

received as haq mehar.
