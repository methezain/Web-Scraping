disposal of the instant writ petition. 
  Any other relief, which this Hon’ble Court may deem fit 
and proper, may also be awarded.”  

2. 

Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner No.1 was married 

to  respondent  No.  3  on  04.08.2017  and  out  of  the  said  wedlock,  a 

daughter  namely  Khadija  Taimoor  was  born  on  01.09.2018,  who  is 

living  with  petitioner  No.1;  that  respondent  No.3  divorced  petitioner 

No.1  on  27.07.2018  levelling  false  allegations  against  her.  It  is 

further stated that respondent No.3 filed a petition under Section 25 

of  the  Guardian  &  Wards  Act,  1890  for  Guardianship  &  Custody  of 

the  Minor  which  was  disposed  of  with  the  condition  that  custody  of 

the  minor  shall  remain  with  petitioner  No.1,  but  an  impracticable 

schedule  of  meeting  has  been  devised  through  the  said  judgment

W.P  No.3435 of 2020 
(Mst. Kanza Khalil & another VS ADJ  & others) 

dated  07.02.2020.  Being  aggrieved  of  the  said  Judgment,  both  the 

parties  preferred 

their  respective  appeals  before  the  learned 

Additional  District  Judge-V-East,  Islamabad  which  were  dismissed 

vide  consolidated  judgment  dated  10.10.2020,  hence  the  instant 

petition. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  has  contended  that  the 

visitation  plan 

framed  by 

the 

learned  Appellate  Court 

is 

impracticable;  that  both  the  parties  are  inimical  towards  each  other 

and  no  compromise  has  been  effected  between  the  parties  with 

regard  to  visitation  plan,  therefore,  the  plan  revised  by  the  learned 

Appellate Court cannot be enforced; that petitioner No.1 is a working 

woman, she has to look after her parents and the minor daughter, as 

such  it  is  impossible  for  the  petitioner  to  comply  with  the  orders 

passed  by  the  learned  lower  Appellate  Court.  Further  argued  that 

respondent  No.3  has  contracted  second  marriage,  therefore,  the 

minor  daughter  cannot  be  left  with  him;  that  petitioner  has  no 

objection if respondent No.3 is allowed to meet minor daughter once 

in a month and that too in the Court premises for one hour only; that 

both  the  Courts  below  have  not  applied  their  judicious  mind  while 

passing the impugned judgment, therefore, the same are liable to be 

set aside. 

4. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.3 

submits that respondent No.3 can pick and drop the minor from the 

house of petitioner No.1, therefore, no question can be raised about 

his  meeting  with  the  minor;  that  respondent  No.3  is  still  paying  the 

maintenance allowance to the minor even after arranging his second 

marriage. Lastly, prayed for dismissal of the instant petition. 

5. 

Arguments heard, record perused. 

6. 

A careful examination of the record reveals that the petitioner 

is  aggrieved  of  the  schedule  of  meeting  of  the  minor  daughter  with 

respondent  No.3,  chalked  out  by  the  learned  Guardian  Judge  and 

modified by the learned lower Appellate Court, whereas respondent 

No.3 has not challenged the custody of the minor to petitioner No.1, 

but  he  cannot  be  deprived  of  his  legal  and  natural  right  of  meeting 

with the minor especially when respondent No.3 is ready to provide

W.P  No.3435 of 2020 
(Mst. Kanza Khalil & another VS ADJ  & others) 

pick and drop facility to the minor from the house of petitioner No.1, 

therefore, petitioner No.1 is not justified to raise any  question about 

his  meeting  with  the  minor  as  per  the  schedule  framed  by  the 

learned  lower  Appellate  Court.  He  is  morally  and  legally  entitled  to 

meet  his  minor  daughter,  being  her  real  father,  in  spite  of  the  fact 

that  he  has  contracted  second  marriage,  as  such,  the  learned 

Additional District Judge has framed the visitation plan of the minor 

with  her  father  in  the  light  of  the  judgment  passed  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  reported  as  Mst.  Madiha  Younus  VS 

Imran Ahmad (2018 SCMR 1991). 

7. 

 Learned counsel for the petitioners has failed to point out any 

illegality  or  irregularity  committed  by  the  learned  lower  Appellate 

Court  calling  for  interference  by  this  Court  in  exercise  of  its 

constitutional jurisdiction. 

8. 

For  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  petition  having  no  force  is 

hereby dismissed.
