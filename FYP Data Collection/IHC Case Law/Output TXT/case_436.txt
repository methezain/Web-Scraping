petitioner in both the writ petitions.   
Mr.  Maher  Abdul  Majid,  Advocate  for  the 
respondents in both the writ petition.   

the 

By  way  of  this  single  order,  I  intend 

to decide the above captioned two (02) writ 

petitions,  having  common  questions  of  law 

and facts. 

02. 

In  W.P.  No. 

1454/2021, 

the 

petitioner  has  impugned  judgment  and 

decree  dated  12.01.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  West-

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
2 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

Islamabad,  whereby  the  appeal  preferred 

against the impugned judgment and decree 

dated 24.07.2019, passed by learned Senior 

Civil  Judge-III  (Judge  Family  Court),  West-

Islamabad, was dismissed. 

03. 

In  W.P.  No. 

1455/2021, 

the 

petitioner has assailed judgment and decree 

dated  12.01.2021,  passed  by 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge  (MCAC),  West-

Islamabad, whereby the appeal filed against 

the judgment and decree dated 15.10.2019, 

passed  by  Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian 

Judge), West-Islamabad, was dismissed. 

04.  Brief  facts  of  the  case  are  that  the 

petitioner was married to respondent No. 1 

in  the  year  2001  under  the  Muslim  Rites 

and  Ceremonies,  from  the  wedlock  the 

spouses  were  blessed  with  children  / 

respondents  Nos.  2  to  5.  The  respondents 

Nos.  2  to  4  /  minors  are  in  custody  of 

respondent  No.  1  /  mother,  whereas 

respondent  No.  5  namely  Muhammad 

 
 
 
 
3 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

Hayyan Faisal is in the custody of petitioner 

/ father. 

05.  During  initial  period,  the  relation 

between the parties remained cordial, which 

turned  strained  due  to  conduct  of  the 

petitioner 

and 

under 

compelling 

circumstances,  respondent  No.  1  went  to 

the  house of  her parents  in  the  year 2005, 

later  on  she  rejoined  the  petitioner  and 

even then his conduct did not change. 

06. 

The respondent  No. 1 filed a suit for 

recovery  of  maintenance  allowance,  dowry 

articles, personal belongings and documents 

against 

the  petitioner,  whereas 

the 

petitioner  filed  a  petition  for  custody  under 

Section  25  of  the  Guardian  and  Ward  Act, 

1890  for  custody  of  respondents  Nos.  2  to 

5. 

07.  Written statements were filed in both 

the  suit,  issues  were  framed  and  after 

recording  evidence  of  both  the  parties, 

learned Senior Civil Judge-III (Judge Family 

Court),  West-Islamabad  held  respondent 

 
 
 
 
 
4 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

No.  1  entitled  for  recovery  of  maintenance 

allowance  for  her Iddat  period  only  at  the 

rate  of  Rs.  10,000/-  (Ten  Thousand)  per 

month;  also  held  entitled  respondents  / 

minors  No.  2 

to  4 

for 

recovery  of 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

8000/-  (Eight  Thousand)  per  month  for 

each of the minor, in addition to expense of 

their education, transportation and clothing, 

till  their  legal  entitlement,  subject  to  10% 

annual  increase  from  the  date  of  decree 

and  the  interim  maintenance  was  ordered 

to  be  adjusted 

towards  arrears  of 

outstanding 

amount 

of  maintenance 

allowance  of  the  minors.  The  respondent 

No. 1 was also held entitled for the recovery 

of  her  diary  from  the  petitioner.  The  claim 

of respondent No. 1 regarding dowry article 

was  satisfied  by  delivering  of  such  articles 

by  the  petitioner,  as  the  marriage  between 

the  parties  has  already  been  dissolved, 

hence prayer of the petitioner for restitution 

of conjugal rights has become redundant.  

 
 
 
5 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

08. 

The  petition  U/S  25  of  Guardian  and 

Wards Act, 1890 for custody of respondents 

Nos.  2  to  5  was  dismissed  and  visitation 

schedule  of  the  minors  with  the  petitioner 

was  also  decided  in  detail  by  the  learned 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge), 

West-Islamabad.  Respondent  No.  5 

/ 

Muhammad  Hayyan  Faisal  in  W.P.  No. 

1455/2021 is in custody of petitioner.  

09.  Being  aggrieved,  petitioner 

filed 

appeals  against  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  dated  24.07.2019 

and  15.10.2019,  which  were  dismissed  by 

the  Court  of  learned  Additional  District 

Judge 

(MCAC),  West-Islamabad 

vide 

impugned 

judgment  and  decree  dated 

12.01.2021. 

10. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter alia contends  that  both  the  impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are  against  the 

facts and law applicable on the subject; the 

issues  have  not  been  decided  properly  in 

the  light  of  evidence  produced  by  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

parties; 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III 

(Judge  Family  Court),  West-Islamabad  has 

not  decided  maintenance  of  the  minors 

according  to  the  financial  status  of  the 

petitioner;  after  passing  the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees, 

the  petitioner 

transferred  to  Karachi,  so  it  is  not  possible 

for  the  petitioner  to  follow  the  visitation 

schedule pronounced by the learned Senior 

Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge),  West-

Islamabad;  both  the  impugned  judgments 

and  decrees  are  based  on  surmises  and 

conjectures,  hence  are  liable  to  be  set 

aside.  

11. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  contesting 

respondents 

has 

controverted 

the 

arguments advanced by learned counsel for 

the  petitioner  and  stated  that  both  the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  are 

passed  strictly  in  accordance  with  law  and 

evidence  produced  by  the  parties;  the 

minors  are  school  going  children  and 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

 
 
 
7 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

8,000/-  (Eight  Thousand)  per  month  for 

each  minor 

is  not  exorbitant, 

rather 

according  to  the  financial  status  /  salary  of 

the  petitioner;  custody  of  the  minors  has 

also  not  handed  over  to  the  petitioner,  as 

the  petitioner  has  contracted  second 

marriage,  hence  prayed  for  dismissal  of 

both the petitions.  

12.  Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  learned 

counsel for the respondents in both the writ 

petitions  have  been  heard  and  record  has 

been perused with their able assistance.  

13. 

Learned  Judges  of  both  the  lower 

Courts  have  discussed  the  merits  of  the 

case  in  detail.  Admittedly,  the  minors  are 

school  going  children  and  maintenance 

allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  8,000/-  (Eight 

Thousand) per month for each of the minor 

in  addition  to  expenses  of  their  education, 

transportation  etc.  is  not  exorbitant.  The 

amount  has  been  decided  by  both  the 

 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

learned  lower  Courts  according  to  the 

financial status of the petitioner.  

14.  As  far  as,  handing  over  the  custody 

of  minors  to  the  petitioner  is  concerned, 

admittedly  the  petitioner  has  contracted 

second  marriage  and  is  living  with  his 

second wife, however the respondent No. 1 

has  not  contracted  second  marriage  and 

being  mother  she  look  after  her  minor 

children  and 

is  giving 

them  proper 

education.  

15. 

It  would  be  in  the  fitness  of  things 

that  the  fate  of  custody  of  the  minors 

should  be  decided  keeping  in  view  welfare 

of  the  minors  which, 

in  fact, 

is  the 

paramount  consideration 

in  respect  of 

custody of the minors. I am fortified by the 

judgments  of  the  superior  Courts.  In  the 

case  reported  as Mst. Firdous Iqbal VS 

Shifaat  Ali  and  others  (2000  SCMR 

838)  Honourable  Supreme  Court  held  as 

under:-- 

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

â€œThe  custody  of  a  minor  can, 

however, be delivered by the court 

only in the interest of welfare of 

the minor  and  not  the  so-called 

right of one parent or another. It is 

true: that a Muslim father is lawful 

guardian of his minor child and is 

ordinarily entitled to his custody 

provided it is for the welfare of the 

minor. It would, thus, he noticed 

that right of the father to claim 

custody  of  minor  son  is  not  an 

absolute right, in that, the father 

may disentitle himself to custody 

on account of his conduct in the 

light of the facts and circumstances 

of each case." Reliance is placed upon 

the  cases  titled  as Khan Muhammad 

VS Mst. Surayya Bibi and others 

(2008 SCMR 480) and Muhammad 

Ashraf  VS  Sakina  (1989  SCMR 

1277).  

16.  As  far  as  the  fact  with  regard  to 

transfer of the petitioner from Islamabad to 

Karachi 

is  concerned,  no  document  / 

transfer  order  has  been  placed  on  record, 

the  petitioner  can  come  from  Karachi  to 

Islamabad,  in  order  to  see  his  minors 

children.  

 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

17. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  any  illegality  in  the 

impugned judgments and decrees. It is well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash a decision for an error of law. It will 

also  be  issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an  inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal  acts  without  jurisdiction  or  in 

excess  of 

its 

jurisdiction,  or  fails  to 

exercise its jurisdiction or where the Court 

or a tribunal acts illegally in exercise of its 

undoubted  jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a 

matter  in  violation  of  the  principle  of 

natural  justice.  The  High  Court  while 

issuing  a  writ of certiorari  acts in exercise 

of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

jurisdiction.  The  High  Court  in  exercise  of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court or a tribunal.  

18. 

In  this  regard,  reliance  is  placed 

upon  the  following  dictums  /  laws  laid 

 
 
 
 
11 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

down  by  the  Honâ€™ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan: 

i.  Amjad Khan VS Muhammad 

Irshad  (Deceased)  through  LRs 

(2020 SCMR 2155). 

ii.  President  All  Pakistan 

Women  Association,  Peshawar 

Cantt VS Muhammad Akbar Awan 

and others (2020 SCMR 260). 

iii.  Chief Executive MEPCO and 

others VS Muhammad Fazil and 

others (2019 SCMR 919). 

iv.  Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and  others 

(PLD 2018 SC 28). 

v.  Shajar Islam VS Muhammad 

Siddique and 2 others (PLD 2007 

SC 45). 

19. 

Further, there are concurrent findings 

of  both  the  learned  Courts  below  against 

the  petitioner.  In  case  of  concurrent 

findings  of  the  courts  below,  scope  of  the 

constitutional petition becomes very limited. 

The  petitioner  has  failed  to  point  out  any 

misreading  or  non-reading  of  the  evidence. 

It  has  been  laid  down  in  a  case  titled  as 

Syed Arif Ali Sabri VS Abdul Samad 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

through L.Rs. and 2 others (2008 YLR 

2309) that: 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope of the constitutional petition 

for interference is very limited and 

it can only be interfered when the 

orders  of  the  Courts  below  are 

fanciful or based on misreading or 

non-reading of the evidence". 

Reliance  is  also  placed  on  cases  titled  as 

Khuda Bukhsh VS Muhammad Sharif 

and another  (1974  SCMR  279),  and 

Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad Ali and 

others (PLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

20. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned  judgments  and  decrees  dated 

12.01.2021 and 24.07.2019 (in writ petition 

No.  1454/2021),  passed  by 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge,  West-Islamabad 

and  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Judge 

Family Court), West-Islamabad, respectively 

as well as impugned judgments and decrees 

dated  12.01.2021  and  15.10.2019  (in writ 

 
 
 
 
 
13 

Writ Petitions Nos. 1454/2021 & 1455/2021 

petition No. 1455/2021), passed by learned 

Additional  District  Judge  (MCAC),  West-

Islamabad  and  Senior  Civil 

Judge-III 

(Guardian 

Judge), 

West-Islamabad, 

respectively, are in accordance with law and 

facts  of  the  matter,  hence  do  not  require 

any interference by this Court. 

21. 

In  view  of  above  prospective,  both 

the  writ  petitions  have  no  merits  and  the 

same  are  dismissed  with  no  order  as  to 

costs.
