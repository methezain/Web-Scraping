W.P.No.523/2012 

MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through  this  judgment,  I 

propose to decide the writ petitions listed in "Schedule-A" hereto. 

2. 

The petitioners, who have all retired from service, seek a direction 

to the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (“P.T.C.L.”) and the 

Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  to  pay  them  pension  with 

periodic increases commensurate to the ones announced by the Federal 

Government for  civil servants from time to  time. Some  of the petitioners 

also  seek  the  payment  of  medical  allowance,  special  additional  pension 

(at the rate of the orderly allowance announced by the Government for in 

service  government servants  in  BPS-20 and  above),  family  pension,  and 

the  restoration  of  the  commuted  portion  of  their  pension  in  the  same 

manner as permissible to civil servants. 

3. 

The Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Act, 1991 (“the 1991 

Act”) was enacted on 25.11.1991. By operation of Section 9(1) of the said 

Act, 

the  employees  of 

the  Pakistan  Telegraph  and  Telephone 

Department,  Government  of  Pakistan 

(“T&T  Department”)  were 

transferred to the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (“P.T.C.”) on 

the  same  terms  and  conditions  to  which  they  were  entitled  immediately 

before such transfer. Section 9(2) of the 1991 Act provided that the terms 

and  conditions  of  service  of  the  departmental  employees  transferred  to 

P.T.C. shall not be varied to their disadvantage. The terms and conditions 

of  service  to  which  such  employees  were  entitled  before  their  transfer 

were to continue to be applicable to them notwithstanding their transfer 

to P.T.C. 

4. 

The Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996 (“the 

1996  Act”)  was  enacted  on  13.10.1996.  Section  34  of  the  said  Act 

provided  inter  alia  that  the  Federal  Government  shall  establish  a 

company to be known as Pakistan Telecommunication Company, limited 

by  shares,  and  cause 

it  to  be 

incorporated  under  the  erstwhile 

Companies Ordinance, 1984. The principal object of this company was to 

be  the  provision  of  the  domestic  and  international  telecommunication 

and related services consistent with the provisions of the 1996 Act. 

5. 

Section 35(2) of the 1996 Act provided inter alia that the employees 

of  P.T.C.,  specified  in  an  order  issued  by  the  Federal  Government 

pursuant  to  Section  35(1)  of  the  said  Act,  shall  be  transferred  to  and 

become  the  employees  of  either  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Company 

 
 
3 

W.P.No.523/2012 

Limited  (“P.T.C.L.”),  the  National  Telecommunication  Corporation,  the 

Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, the Pakistan Telecommunication 

Employees Trust,  or  the Frequency  Allocation Board referred  to  in such 

order. It is an admitted position that  the petitioners stood transferred to 

P.T.C.L. by virtue of the said provisions in the 1996 Act. 

6. 

Section  36(1)  of  the  1996  Act  provided  inter alia  that  no  person 

transferred to P.T.C.L. pursuant to Section 35(2) of the said Act shall be 

entitled  to  any  compensation  as  a  consequence of such transfer.  Under 

the proviso to Section 36(1) of the said Act, the Federal Government was 

under  an  obligation  to  guarantee  the  existing  terms  and  conditions  of 

service  and  rights  including  pensionary  benefits  of  the  employees 

transferred to P.T.C.L. Under Section 36(2) of the said Act, the terms and 

conditions  of  service  of  any  such  transferred  employees  could  not  be 

altered  adversely  by  P.T.C.L.  except  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of 

Pakistan  or  with  the  consent  of  such  transferred  employees  and  the 

award  of  appropriate  compensation.  Section  36(5)  of  the  1996  Act 

provided as follows:- 

"36(5) Under the order vesting property of the Corporation in the 
Company, the Federal Government shall require the Company to assume 
the  responsibility  of  pensionary  benefits  of  the  telecommunication 
employees and the Company shall not alter such pensionary benefits 
without the consent of the individuals concerned and the award of 
appropriate compensation."  

7. 

In  this  judgment,  the  petitioners  who  were  employed  in  T&T 

Department  and  transferred  to  P.T.C.  by  operation  of  Section  9  of  the 

1991 Act and further transferred to P.T.C.L. by operation of  Sections 35 

and  36  of  the  1996  Act,  and  who  retired  while  in  service  of  P.T.C.  or 

P.T.C.L. shall be referred to as “departmental employees”. 

8. 

At 

this  stage, 

it  may  be  mentioned 

that 

the  Pakistan 

Telecommunication  Corporation  Employees  Pension  Fund  (“P.T.C.E. 

Pension  Fund”)  was  created  by  a  trust  deed  dated  02.04.1994.  It  is  a 

matter  of  record  that  clause  2  of  the  trust  deed  provided  that  “all 

departmental employees transferred to the Corporation as defined in 

Section 9 of the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation Act, 1991 shall 

be entitled to benefits as defined under the Federal Government Pension 

Rules as applicable to such employees before the formation of P.T.C.” 

Section  45(1)  of  the  1996  Act  provided  inter alia  that  the  Federal 

Government  shall,  by  notification  in  the  official  Gazette,  order  that  all 

 
4 

W.P.No.523/2012 

assets of the P.T.C.E. Pension Fund and such liabilities as are specified in 

the notification, shall vest in and shall become the assets and liabilities of 

the Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust (“P.T.E.T”) established 

by  the  Federal  Government  pursuant  to  Section  44(1)  of  the  said  Act. 

P.T.E.T. was to be a body corporate managed by a board of six trustees, 

three  of  whom  were  to  be  appointed  by  the  Federal  Government  and 

three by P.T.C.L. 

9. 

Under  Section  45(2)  of  the  1996  Act,  P.T.C.L.  was  to  contribute  to 

the  Pension  Fund  the  amount  determined  by  the  Actuary  (appointed  by 

the  trustees)  representing  the  unfunded  portion  of  the  accrued  pension 

liabilities  which  was  to  be  assumed  by  P.T.C.L.  The  Pension  Fund 

administered by P.T.E.T. was to consist of (a) amounts received from the 

P.T.C.E. Pension Fund; (b) contributions to be paid by P.T.C.L.; (c) annual 

contribution  to  be  paid  by  P.T.C.L.  at  the  commencement  of  each 

financial  year;  (d) investments  and  profits,  gains  and  other  returns 

accrued on such investments; and (e) donations and other contributions 

by individuals or any aid-giving agencies. 

10.  One of the functions and powers of P.T.E.T. was to make provision 

for  the  payment  of  pension  to  the  telecommunication  employees  to  the 

extent of their entitlement. In the performance of its functions, the Board 

of Trustees had inter alia the exclusive right to determine the amounts, if 

any, payable in respect of pensionary benefits to the telecommunication 

employees.  P.T.E.T.  was  created  through  notification  No.5(3)/93-PTET, 

dated 03.01.1996 after which all assets and liabilities of P.T.C.E. Pension 

Fund became vested in P.T.E.T. 

11.  Having  discussed  the  statutory  scheme  regarding  the  transfer  of 

the employees of T&T Department/departmental employees to the P.T.C. 

and then to the P.T.C.L. by operation of  the above-mentioned provisions 

of the 1991 Act and the 1996 Act, and their entitlement to the payment of 

pension  after  their  retirement,  it  is  pertinent  to  mention  that  the  retired 

departmental  employees  who  had  pensionable  service  had  been  paid 

their  pension  as  well  as  the  periodic  increases  in  pension  in  the  same 

proportion as paid by the Federal Government to retired civil servants up 

to  30.06.2010.  The  decisions  to 

increase  pension  for  the  retired 

employees of P.T.C.L. at the same rate as was increased by the Federal 

5 

W.P.No.523/2012 

Government for retired civil servants were made from time to time by the 

Board of Trustees of P.T.E.T. 

12. 

It is not disputed that until 30.06.2010, the increases in the rate  of 

pension made by P.T.E.T. for its pensioners was commensurate with the 

increases in such rates made by the Federal Government for retired civil 

servants  from  time  to  time.  For  instance,  the  Federal  Government,  vide 

Office  Memorandum  (“O.M.”),  dated  13.07.2009  had  increased  the 

pension  for  civil  servants.  Vide  letter  dated  17.07.2009,  the  Board  of 

Trustees  of  P.T.E.T.,  after  making  reference  to  the  said  O.M.,  approved 

the increases in pension for the retired employees of P.T.C.L. at the same 

rate as had been increased by the Federal Government through the said 

O.M. The disparity in the rate of increase of such pension by P.T.E.T. and 

the  Federal  Government  arose  after  30.06.2010.  For  the  purposes  of 

clarity, such disparity is set out in the table below:-

13.  On  11.08.2010,  the  General  Manager  (C&A),  P.T.E.T.  asked  the 

Post Masters not to pay the increases in pension and medical allowance 

to  the  pensioners  of  P.T.C.L.  until  such  increases  were  approved  by 

P.T.C.L. 

14.  The retired employees of P.T.C.L. filed writ petitions (including writ 

petition  No.148/2011)  before  this  Court  assailing  the  said  letter  dated 

11.08.2010  and  praying  for  the  increases  in  the  pension  and  medical 

 
 
6 

W.P.No.523/2012 

allowance  announced  by  the  Federal  Government  to  be  paid  to  them. 

Vide 

judgment  dated  21.12.2011,  the 

learned  Judge-in-Chambers 

allowed the writ petitions, and P.T.E.T. was “directed to pay pension etc. 

to the petitioners according to the increase made by the Government 

along with arrears if any.” In the said judgment, after making reference to 

Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35, 36, 44 and 46 of the 1996 Act, 

it was inter alia held as follows:- 

“28.  The situation which crystallizes from the above quoted provisions of 
law is that the terms and conditions of service of employees could not be 
varied to their disadvantage, the same could not be altered adversely by 
the Company without consent of the employees and subsection-5 of 
Section 36 further stresses that the Company could not alter pensionary 
benefits without the consent of the individuals. It also manifests from the 
above provisions that the Federal Government has guaranteed that 
existing terms and conditions of service and rights including pensionary 
benefits of the employees and the Federal Government has also assumed 
the responsibility of pensionary benefits of employees. It is not the case 
of the respondents that before taking the impugned action, they had ever 
consulted the pensioners. The same can be termed as disadvantage. It is 
crystal clear that the impugned action is illegal and flagrant violation of 
provisions of Act, 1996. It is also against the principle of “A communi 
observantia non est recedendum” (where a thing provided to be done in 
a particular manner that must be done in that manner and not other than 
that). The Hon‟ble Supreme Court of Pakistan in the matter of: HUMAN 
RIGHTS CASES NOS.4668 OF 2006, 1111 OF 2007 AND 15283-G of 2010 
has held that “Things are required to be done strictly according to law, or 
it should not be done at all”. 

15.  The  said  judgment  dated  21.12.2011  was  assailed  by  P.T.C.L.  etc. 

in  Intra  Court  Appeals  (including  I.C.A.No.8/2012)  before  the  Division 

Bench  of  this  Court.  Vide  judgment  dated  17.03.2014,  the  said  appeals 

were  dismissed  with  costs.  On  the  question  whether  the  retired 

departmental employees were also entitled to the increases in pension at 

the  same  rate  as  announced  by  the  Federal  Government  for  the  retired 

civil  servants,  the  view  of  the  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  was  as 

follows:- 

“17.  The contention that the company had accepted the liability to the 
extent of payment of pension fixed at the time of retirement and not for 
the future increases, again is not correct, for the simple reason that the 
pension is part of pay and any increase extended to the similarly placed 
employees can not be refused to the respondents, as they can not be 
discriminated  against  others.  Denial  of  increases,  made  by  the 
Government,  to  the  respondents  is  violative  of  Article  25  of  the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.” 

16.  P.T.C.L.  etc.  filed  petitions  against  the  said  judgment  dated 

17.03.2014  before  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court.  Vide  judgment  dated 

12.06.2015  reported  as  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

 
 
 
7 

W.P.No.523/2012 

(PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (2015  SCMR  1472),  the  said  petitions  were 

dismissed  and  it  was  held  inter  alia  that  “the  employees  of  T&T 

Department having retired after their transfer to the Corporation and the 

Company, will be entitled to the same pension as is announced by the 

Government of Pakistan and that the Board of Trustees of the trust is 

bound to follow such announcement of the Government in respect of 

such employees.”  

17.  The said judgment dated 12.06.2015 was sought to be reviewed by 

P.T.C.L. etc. in several review petitions, which were all disposed of vide 

order  dated  17.05.2017  passed  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court.  The 

primary  ground  taken  by  P.T.C.L.  in  the  said  review  petitions  was  that 

some of the ex-employees of P.T.C.L. in whose favour the judgment under 

review had been passed, had availed the benefit of Voluntary Separation 

Scheme  (“V.S.S.”),  and  having  done  so,  they  were  not  entitled  to  the 

benefit  of  pension  in  terms  of  what  was  announced  by  the  Federal 

Government,  and  that  the  High  Court  could  not  have  exercised  its 

jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution in such cases since the 

V.S.S.  had  converted  their  employment  to  be  governed  by  contract  as 

contained in the V.S.S. 

18.  The  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  also  recorded  the  contention  of  the 

learned counsel for the review petitioners that P.T.C.L. will approach the 

High  Court  by  filing  an  application  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  for 

resolving  the  said  issue  in  accordance  with  the  law.  The  Hon‟ble 

Supreme  Court,  after  observing  that  the  submissions  made  by  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  review  petitioners  seemed  to  be  fair  and 

reasonable,  disposed  of  the  review  petitions  without  giving  findings  on 

any of the grounds agitated in such petitions. For the purposes of clarity, 

paragraphs  5  and  6  of  the  said  order  dated  17.05.2017  are  reproduced 

herein below:- 

“5. In the circumstances, submission made by Mr. Khalid Anwar, learned 
Sr. ASC for the Review Petitioners and adopted by counsel for other 
review petitioners, as noted above, prima facie seem to be fair and 
reasonable and without expressing ourselves on any  of the points 
involved in the matter, we feel that cause of justice will be met if all these 
Review Petitions are disposed of accordingly. 
6.   Consequently, the listed Review Petitions are disposed of and the 
PTCL/Review Petitioners to the extent as noted above may avail remedy 
under Section 12(2), CPC which shall be decided by the concerned Court 
in accordance with law. At the same time, the PTCL/Review Petitioners 

8 

W.P.No.523/2012 

may urge all points available to them in other cases pending before the 
High Courts in accordance with law. Disposed of.” 

19.  P.T.C.L.  filed  several  applications  under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C. 

against  the judgment dated  17.03.2014 passed  by  the  Division  Bench of 

this  Court  in  Intra  Court  Appeal  No.08/2012  and  connected  matters, 

whereby  appeals  against  the  judgment dated  21.12.2011 passed  by  this 

Court  in  writ  petition  No.148/2011  and  connected  matters  had  been 

dismissed.  As  mentioned  above,  vide 

the  said 

judgment  dated 

21.12.2011,  the  learned  Judge-in-Chambers  had  allowed  several  writ 

petitions  filed  by  the  retired  employees  of  P.T.C.L.,  who  had  been 

transferred from T&T Department, and held that they were entitled to be 

paid the increases in pension announced by the Government of Pakistan, 

and  directed  P.T.C.L.  to  pay  pension  etc.  to  them  according  to  the 

increase made by the government along with arrears, if any. 

20.  A  preliminary  objection  to  the  maintainability  of  said  application 

under  Section  12(2)  C.P.C.  was  taken  by  the  respondents  in  the  said 

application  that  since  the  judgment  dated  17.03.2014  passed  by  the 

Division  Bench  of  this  Court  had  been  upheld  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme 

Court  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

(PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (supra),  P.T.C.L.  could  only  file  the 

application under Section 12(2) C.P.C. before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 

in view of the law laid down in the case of Sahibzadi Maharunisa VS Mst. 

Ghulam  Sughran  (PLD  2016  SC  358).  The  said  preliminary  objection 

found favour with the Division Bench of this Court, and vide order dated 

22.01.2018, the said applications were dismissed as not maintainable.  

21.  The  said  order  dated  22.01.2018  has  been  assailed  by  P.T.C.L. 

before the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. I am told that P.T.C.L. has also made 

an alternative prayer for its petitions for leave to appeal against the said 

order to be treated as applications under Section 12(2) C.P.C. against the 

judgment  dated  12.06.2015,  reported  as  Pakistan  Telecommunication 

Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif (supra).  The  said  petitions 

are  pending  adjudication  before  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court.  It  was  in 

these  circumstances  that  the  writ  petitions  proposed  to  be  decided 

through this judgment were filed.

W.P.No.523/2012 

CONTENTIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONERS:- 

22.  Learned counsel for the petitioners drew the attention of the Court 

to  the  law  laid  down  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  cases  of 

Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad 

Arif (supra), and Muhammad Riaz VS Federation of Pakistan (2015 SCMR 

1783), and submitted that the petitioners seek the grant of the same relief 

as  was  granted  to  the  retired  employees  of  P.T.C.L.  in  the  said  cases; 

that  it  is  the  petitioners‟  fundamental  right  to  be  granted  all  pensionary 

and  retirement  benefits  as  were  payable  by  the  Federal  Government  to 

retired civil servants; that such retirement benefits are not just restricted 

to  pension  or  increases  in  pension  but  also  include  medical  allowance, 

special  additional  pension  (at  the  rate  of  the  orderly  allowance 

announced  by  the  Government  for  in-service  government  servants  in 

BPS-20 and above), family pension, and the restoration of the commuted 

portion;  that  upon  the  transfer  of  the  departmental  employees  to  P.T.C. 

and thereafter to P.T.C.L., the terms and conditions of their service were 

protected under Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35 and 36 of the 

1996 Act; that it is well settled that pension is not a bounty but a right and 

the  same  cannot  be  reduced  arbitrarily;  that  when  the  departmental 

employees were transferred to P.T.C., they were not told that they would 

not be given the same benefits as would have accrued to civil servants in 

the future;  that it  is  an  admitted  position that prior to  the transfer  of the 

departmental  employees  from  T&T  Department  to  P.T.C.  they  were  civil 

servants;  that  after  the  transfer  of  such  departmental  employees,  they 

were  no  longer  civil  servants  but  by  virtue  of  the  protection  afforded  to 

them under Section 9 of the 1991 Act, they were entitled to be given the 

same retirement benefits as were granted by the Federal Government to 

retired  civil  servants;  that  since  up  to  2010,  the  rate  of  increases  in 

pension  payable  to  the  retired  employees  of  P.T.C.L.  was  exactly  the 

same  as  the  rate  of  increases  in  pension  announced  by  the  Federal 

Government for retired civil servants, this was the correct interpretation 

of  the  protection  afforded  to  the  departmental  employees  as  well  as 

employees  transferred  from  P.T.C.  to  P.T.C.L.  enshrined  in  Section  9  of 

the 1991 Act and Sections 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act; and that the Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  has  already  held  that  the  disparity  in  the  rate  of  the 

increases  in  pension  between  the  one  allowed  by  P.T.E.T.  to  the  retired 

 
10 

W.P.No.523/2012 

employees of P.T.C.L. and the one allowed by the Federal Government to 

retired  civil  servants  was  unlawful.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners 

prayed  for  the  writ  petitions  to  be  allowed  in  terms  of  the  relief  sough 

therein. 

CONTENTIONS OF THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR P.T.C.L.:- 

23.  Learned counsel for P.T.C.L. contended that in the case of Pakistan 

Telecommunications  Corporation  VS  Riaz  Ahmad  (PLD  1996  SC  222),  it 

has  been  held  inter alia  that  the  employees  of  P.T.C.  who  had  been 

transferred  en  bloc  from  T&T  Department  under  Section  9  of  the  1991 

Act were civil servants within the meaning of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 

and could approach the Service Tribunal to enforce a service rule related 

to  a  condition  of  their  eligibility  for  promotion  to  a  higher  post;  that 

similarly  in  the  case  of  Divisional  Engineer  Phones,  Phones  Division, 

Sukkur  VS  Muhammad  Shahid  (1999  SCMR  1526),  it  was  held inter alia 

that if an employee transferred to P.T.C. was a civil servant before such 

transfer, he continues to be a civil servant; that the law laid down in the 

above referred two judgments was still holding the field when the Hon‟ble 

Supreme Court passed the judgment in the case of Masood Ahmed Bhatti 

VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (2012  SCMR  152),  which  begins  with  the 

sentence: “These appeals have been filed by three individual appellants 

who admittedly were civil servants employed in the Telephone and 

Telegraph („T&T‟) Department prior to the enactment of the Pakistan 

Telecommunication Corporation Act, 1991 (the „PTC Act‟)”; that although 

the  review  petitions  against  the  judgment  in  the  case  of  Masood  Ahmed 

Bhatti VS Federation of Pakistan (supra) were dismissed by the Hon‟ble 

Supreme  Court  vide  judgment  reported  as  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed 

Bhatti (2016 SCMR 1362), it was held inter alia that the employees of T&T 

Department  on  their  transfer  to  P.T.C.  and  further  transfer  to  P.T.C.L. 

“did not remain civil servants anymore”;  that  the  said  judgment  was 

passed  on  19.02.2016,  i.e.  after  the  judgment  dated  21.02.2011  passed 

by  the  learned  Single  Bench  of  this  Court  in  writ  petition  No.148/2011 

etc.,  judgment  dated  17.03.2014  passed  by  the  Division  Bench  of  this 

Court in I.C.A.No.8/2012 etc., and judgment dated 12.06.2015 passed by 

the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in  civil  petitions  No.565-568  and  582-

584/2014  etc  reported  as  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

(PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (2015  SCMR  1472);  that  since  the  latest 

 
 
11 

W.P.No.523/2012 

dictum of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court is that the departmental employees 

are  not  civil  servants  after  their  transfer  to  P.T.C.,  the  law  laid  down  in 

the  above-mentioned 

judgments  dated  21.12.2011,  17.03.2014  and 

12.06.2015  no 

longer  holds  good;  that  the 

increases 

in  pension 

announced by the  Federal Government from time to time are not for  the 

benefit of non-civil servants, and therefore the benefit of such increases 

cannot  be  given  to  the  departmental  employees;  that  P.T.C.L.  has  also 

increased the pension payable to its retired employees with pensionable 

service, however such increases are not at the same rate of increases in 

pension announced by the Federal Government for retired civil servants 

from  time  to  time;  that  since  the  departmental  employees,  after  their 

transfer to P.T.C. were no longer civil servants, they were not entitled to 

any  of  the  retirement  benefits  to  which  retired  civil  servants  had  been 

made  entitled  by  the  Government;  and  that  the  petitions  filed  by  the 

petitioners who were employed in P.T.C. after the enactment of the 1991 

Act are  not maintainable since the terms and conditions of their service 

were  not  governed  by  statutory  rules.  Learned  counsel  for  P.T.C.L. 

prayed for the petitions to be dismissed.  

24. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

contesting  parties  and  have  perused  the  record  with  their  able 

assistance.  The  facts  leading  to  the  filing  of  the  instant  petitions  have 

been set out in sufficient detail in paragraphs 2 to 21 above, and need not 

be recapitulated.  

25.  As  mentioned  above,  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of 

Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad 

Arif (supra)  held inter alia  that  the  retired  departmental  employees “will 

be entitled to the same pension as is announced by the Government of 

Pakistan and that the Board of Trustees of the Trust is bound to follow 

such announcement of the Government in respect of such employees.” 

Against  the  said  judgment,  P.T.C.L.  has  filed  an  application  under 

Section 12(2)  C.P.C.  which is  still  pending  adjudication.  It  remains  to  be 

seen  what  the  fate  of  the  said  application  would  be  and  whether  or  not 

the law laid down in said case of Pakistan Telecommunication Employees 

Trust (PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif (supra) is  interfered  with.  Be  that  as  it 

may,  the  mere  pendency  of  such  an  application  before  the  Hon‟ble 

Supreme Court does not in any manner dilute the mandate in Article 189 

12 

W.P.No.523/2012 

of the Constitution which makes a decision of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 

to  the  extent  that  it  decides  a  question  of  law  or  is  based  upon  or 

enunciates a principle of law, binding on all other Courts in Pakistan.  

26.  As  can  be  gathered  from  the  discussion  in  paragraphs  14  to  21 

above,  this  is  not  the  first  time  when  retired  departmental  employees 

have  invoked  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  to  seek  a 

direction  to  P.T.C.L.  and  P.T.E.T.  to  pay  them  pension  along  with  the 

periodic  increases  at  the  same  rate  as  announced  by  the  Federal 

Government for civil servants from time to time. 

27.  As  mentioned  above,  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication 

Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (supra),  the  Hon‟ble 

Supreme  Court  held  in  unequivocal  terms  that  the  employees  of  T&T 

Department having  retired  after their  transfer to P.T.C. and  P.T.C.L.  are 

entitled to pension at the same rate as announced by the Government for 

civil  servants,  and  that  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  P.T.E.T.  was  bound  to 

follow  such  announcements  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan.  In  the  said 

case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court dealt with the departmental employees 

“who  were  employed  in  T&T  Department  and  transferred  to  the 

Corporation and then to the Company and not any other employees”. 

Paragraphs  18  and  19  of  the  said  judgment  is  most  instructive,  the 

relevant portions whereof are reproduced herein below:- 

“18. …Thus, it becomes clear that the employees of T&T Department who 
were transferred to the Corporation and then to the Company having 
retired, they will as per the terms and conditions of service will be 
entitled to payment of pension also according to the one announced by 
the  Government  of  Pakistan.  Thus  if  any  increase  in  pension  is 
announced by the Government of Pakistan for its employees, the same 
will also apply and will be paid to the employees of T&T Department 
transferred to the Corporation and then to the Company. …” 

“19.  Adverting to the submission of Mr. Shahid Anwar Bajwa, learned 
ASC, we may note that while the Company may be entitled to fix the terms 
and conditions of service of its employees so also the provision of 
pension by the Board of Trustees of the Trust but as discussed above, as 
regards  the  employees  of  T&T  Department  transferred  to  the 
Corporation and then to the Company, their terms and conditions of 
service stand protected by the provision of Section 9 of the Act of 1991 
and Sections 35, 36 and 46 of the Act of 1996 and thus they will be 
entitled to payment of increase in pension as is announced by the 
Government of Pakistan. The contribution of the Company to the Pension 
Fund determined by the Actuary and its payment by the Company does 
not appear to be of much relevance because the question before us is of 
entitlement of the respondents to the increase in pension. …” 

 
 
13 

W.P.No.523/2012 

28.  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation  of 

Pakistan (supra), the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, consistent with the law laid 

down in the case of Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET) 

VS Muhammad Arif (supra) held that the petitioner in the said case, who 

had  been  transferred  from  T&T  Department  to  P.T.C.  by  operation  of 

Section  9  of  the  1991  Act,  and  subsequently  to  P.T.C.L.  by  operation  of 

Sections 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act, was “entitled to payment of increase 

in pay and pension as announced by the Government from time to time”. 

As  P.T.C.L.  has  not  filed  a  review  petition  against  the  judgment  in  the 

case  of  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (supra),  it  has 

attained finality for all intents and purposes.  

29.  The  main  thrust  of  the  arguments  of  the  learned  counsel  for 

P.T.C.L.  was  that  the  retired  departmental  employees  cannot  be  held  to 

be entitled to the increases in pension at the same rate as announced by 

the  Government  for  retired  civil  servants  on  the  basis  of  the  law  laid 

down  in  the  cases  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

(PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif (supra)  and  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation 

of  Pakistan (supra), since  subsequently,  it  had  been  held  in  the  case  of 

P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  that  the  departmental 

employees, after their transfer to P.T.C., were no longer civil servants.  

30.  True,  the  judgment  of  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of 

Masood Ahmed Bhatti VS Federation of Pakistan (supra) proceeds on the 

assumption  that  the  departmental  employees  transferred  to  P.T.C.  and 

further  transferred  to  P.T.C.L.  under  the  provisions  of  the  1991  Act  and 

the 1996 Act were civil servants. By dint of the law laid down in the case 

of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra),  the  departmental 

employees, after their transfer to P.T.C. and further transfer to P.T.C.L., 

were no longer civil servants but since the terms and conditions of their 

service prior to their transfer were admittedly those of civil servants, and 

since  such  terms  and  conditions  of  their  service  stood  protected  by 

Section  9  of  the  1991  Act  and  Sections  35  and  36  of  the  1996  Act,  they 

would  be  entitled  to  all  those  service  benefits  to  which  a  civil  servant 

would be entitled. In other words, notwithstanding their transfer to P.T.C. 

and subsequently to P.T.C.L., the departmental employees were entitled 

to  be  given  all  those  service  benefits  as  were  payable  to  retired  civil 

servants.  To  hold  otherwise  would  not  just  be  placing  the  departmental 

14 

W.P.No.523/2012 

employees  in  a  disadvantageous  financial  position  on  account  of  their 

transfer  but  also  meting  out  a  treatment  to  them  in  violation  of  Section 

9(2)  of  the  1991  Act  which  provides  inter alia  that  the  terms  and 

conditions  of service  of  the  departmental  employees  shall not  be varied 

to their disadvantage, and Section 36(2) of the  1996 Act which provides 

inter alia that the terms and conditions of the transferred employees shall 

not  be  altered  adversely  by  P.T.C.L.  The  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in  the 

case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  has  also  observed, 

after making  reference to the said statutory provisions, that  none of the 

terms  and  conditions  of  their  service  could  be  varied  to  their 

disadvantage. 

31.  The law laid down in the above referred two judgments in the cases 

of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad 

Arif  (supra)  and  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (supra) 

cannot  be  held  to  have  been  displaced  by  the  judgment  of  the  Hon‟ble 

Supreme Court in the case of P.T.C.L. VS Masood Ahmed Bhatti (supra) 

wherein  it  was  held  that  the  employees  of  T&T  Department  upon  their 

transfer  to  P.T.C.  and  further  transfer  to  P.T.C.L.  were  no  longer  civil 

servants.  In the  latter  case,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of such 

departmental  employees  provided  in  Sections  3  to  22  of  the  Civil 

Servants Act, 1973 were held to have been protected by Section 9 of the 

1991 Act and Sections 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act.  

32.  Proceeding on hypothesis, even if the law laid down by the Hon‟ble 

Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees 

Trust (PTET) VS Muhammad Arif (supra), as well as the judgments dated 

21.12.2011 and  17.03.2014 passed  by  the learned  Single  Bench  and  the 

learned  Division  Bench  of  this  Court,  respectively,  is  to  be  ignored,  the 

latest authority on the subject as to whether the departmental employees 

(i.e.  the  employees  transferred  from  T&T  Department  to  P.T.C.  and 

further transferred  to  P.T.C.L.  by  operation  of statute)  are  entitled  to all 

the  service  and  retirement  benefits  that  could  be  derived  by  civil 

servants  or  retired  civil  servants  is  the  case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood 

Ahmed Bhatti (supra). In the said judgment, the Hon‟ble Supreme Court, 

after holding that the employees of T&T Department after their transfer to 

P.T.C.  and  further  transfer  to  P.T.C.L.  by  operation  of  statute,  “did not 

remain Civil Servants any more”,  held  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of 

15 

W.P.No.523/2012 

service  of  such  employees  provided  by  Sections  3  to  22  of  the  Civil 

Servants  Act,  1973  were  protected  by  Section  9(2)  of  the  1991  Act  and 

Sections  35(2),  36(a)  and  (b)  of  the  1996  Act.  Therefore,  the  mere  fact 

that  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood 

Ahmed Bhatti (supra) held that such departmental employees, after their 

transfer did not retain their status as civil servants would not, in my view, 

disentitle  such  departmental  employees  from  being  given  all  the 

retirement  benefits  including  the  increases  in  pension  etc.  as  a  retired 

civil  servant  was  entitled  to  receive.  For  the  purposes  of  clarity,  the 

relevant portion of the said report is reproduced herein below:- 

“A fleeting glance at the provisions quoted above would reveal that the 
departmental employees on their transfer to the Corporation became 
employees of the Corporation under section 9 of the Act of 1991 and then 
of the Company under section 35 of the Act of 1996. Their terms and 
conditions of service were fully protected under section 9(2) of the Act of 
1991 and 35(2) of the Act of 1996. None of the terms and conditions could 
be  varied  to  their  disadvantage  as  is  provided  by  the  sections 
reproduced above. Not only that the legislature also bound the Federal 
Government to guarantee the existing terms and conditions of service 
and rights including pensionary benefits of the transferred employees. 
Since they by virtue of the aforesaid provisions became employees of the 
Corporation in the first instance and then the Company, they did not 
remain Civil Servants any more. But the terms and conditions of their 
service provided by sections 3 to 22 of the Civil Servants Act and 
protected by section 9(2) of the Act of 1991 and sections 35(2), 36(a) and 
(b) of the Act of 1996 are essentially statutory. Violation of any of them 
would thus be amenable to the constitutional jurisdiction of the High 
Court. Though in the cases of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation 
and another v. Riaz Ahmed and 6 others and Divisional Engineer Phones, 
Phones Division, Sukkur and another v. Muhammad Shahid and others 
(supra) it was held that the departmental employees on their transfer to 
the Corporation and then to the Company would continue to be Civil 
Servants, but this interpretation does not appear to be correct as they on 
their transfer became employees of the Corporation under section 9 of 
the Act of 1991 and then of the Company under section 35 of the Act of 
1996. Retention of their status as civil servants is thus not supported by 
the words used in the aforesaid provisions.” 

33.  Since the departmental employees after their transfer to P.T.C. lost 

their status of being civil servants, they cannot invoke the jurisdiction of 

the  Service  Tribunal  to  agitate  a  matter  regarding  the  terms  and 

conditions of their service. There is nothing prevising such employees to 

seek  relief  in  the  Constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  regarding  a 

matter  concerning  the  terms  and  conditions  of  their  service.  This  has 

been  explicitly  held  in  the  case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti 

(supra). It  ought  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in 

the  case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  dismissed  the 

 
16 

W.P.No.523/2012 

review petitions filed against the judgment of the Hon‟ble Supreme Court 

in  the  case  of  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan (supra) 

wherein the  contention  of the  learned  counsel for  P.T.C.L.,  that P.T.C.L. 

was  left  free  to  deal  with  its  employees  regardless  of  any  constraints 

specified  in  Sections  35  and  36  of  the  1996  Act,  was  held  to  be  with  no 

force.  Furthermore,  after  referring  to  the  protection  given  to  the  terms 

and  conditions  of  the  departmental  employees/T&T  employees  under 

Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act, it was 

also held that P.T.C.L. as well as the Federal Government had no power 

to  vary  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  such  departmental 

employees.  

34. 

It  also  ought  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  the  judgment  in  the  case  of 

P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  was  announced  on 

19.02.2016,  i.e.  prior  in  time  to  the  disposal  of  the  review  petitions  filed 

by  P.T.C.L.  against 

the 

judgment 

in 

the  case  of  Pakistan 

Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET) VS Muhammad Arif (supra). 

Yet the Hon'ble Supreme Court did  not feel the need to  displace the law 

laid  down  in  the  case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

(PTET) VS Muhammad Arif (supra) on the basis of the observations in the 

case of P.T.C.L. VS Masood Ahmed Bhatti (supra). 

35. 

It  may  be  mentioned  that  some  departmental  employees  who  had 

successfully  litigated  against  P.T.C.L.  and  P.T.E.T.  for  the  increases  in 

pension to be paid to them at the same rate as the increases in pension 

were being paid by the Federal Government to retired civil servants had 

filed contempt petitions against P.T.E.T. etc. before the Hon‟ble Supreme 

Court.  These  contempt  petitions  were  disposed  of  vide  order  dated 

15.02.2018 in the following terms:- 

“At the very outset Mr. Shahid Anwar Bajwa, learned ASC for the alleged 
contemnors/PTCL/PTET has made a categorical statement before the 
Court that all petitioners besides VS optees will be given pension by the 
alleged  contemnors/PTCL/PTET  along  with  incentive  pay  and  that 
PTCL/PTET will  not make  any  sort  of  recovery/deduction  from  the 
pension of the petitioners, which they were already receiving and the 
present status would be that the petitioners will be granted increases in 
pension as is announced by the Federal Government from time to time. It 
is  further  stated  by  the  learned  ASC  for  the  alleged 
contemnors/PTCL/PTET that the alleged contemnors/PTCL/PTET shall 
make payments of pension with incentive pay to the petitioners besides 
VS optees within a period of fifteen days from today directly to the 
petitioners and will submit a compliance report in this regard with the 
Registrar of this Court. The question of refund of the amount deposited 
by the alleged contemnors/PTCL/PTET in this Court will be considered 

17 

W.P.No.523/2012 

after submission of such compliance report. The above terms are also 
agreed by all the learned ASCs for the petitioners-Criminal Original 
Petition No.53 of 2015 and Criminal Original Petition No.54 of 2015 are 
therefore disposed of.” 

36. 

If  the  argument  of  the  learned  counsel  for  P.T.C.L.,  that  since  the 

departmental  employees  upon  their  transfer  to  P.T.C.  and  further 

transfer  to  P.T.C.L.  had  ceased  to  be  civil  servants  and  were  therefore 

not  entitled  to  the  same  benefits  as  were  payable  to  civil  servants,  is  to 

be  accepted,  there  would  have  been  no  occasion  for  the  Hon‟ble 

Supreme Court to have disposed of the contempt petitions in the manner 

that  it  did  vide  the  said  order  dated  15.02.2018.  This  order  was 

subsequent in time to the judgment of the  Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the 

case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti (supra)  wherein  it  had  been 

held that the departmental employees after their transfer to P.T.C. were 

no longer civil servants. This dictum did not take away the entitlement of 

such  departmental  employees  to  be  paid  pension  with  increases  at  the 

same  rate  as  announced  by  the  Federal  Government  for  retired  civil 

servants  from  time  to  time.  This  is  the  reason  why  P.T.C.L.  made  a 

statement  before  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  that  the  petitioners  who 

had  filed  the  contempt  petitions  would  be  paid  pension  along  with 

“increases in pension as is announced by the Federal Government from 

time to time”. Therefore, it is safe to hold that the law laid by the Hon‟ble 

Supreme  Court  in  the  cases  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees 

Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (supra)  and  Muhammad  Riaz  VS 

Federation of Pakistan (supra) had not been displaced by the judgment in 

the case of P.T.C.L. VS Masood Ahmed Bhatti (supra) to the extent of the 

ratio  that  the  departmental  employees  retiring  after  their  transfer  to 

P.T.C.  and  further  transfer  to  P.T.C.L.  were  entitled  to  be  paid  pension 

with  periodic  increases  at  the  same  rate  as  announced  by  the  Federal 

Government for retired civil servants from time to time.  

37.  Since the law laid down by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the cases 

of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad 

Arif  (supra),  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  (supra),  and 

P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood  Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  is  binding  not  just  on  this 

Court but also on P.T.C.L. and P.T.E.T. in terms of Articles 189 and 190 of 

the  Constitution,  P.T.C.L.  and  P.T.E.T  were  bound  to  give  all  the 

departmental employees the very same benefit as had been given to the 

similarly  placed  departmental  employees  who  were  parties  to  the 

 
18 

W.P.No.523/2012 

litigation  in  the  cases  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust 

(PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (supra)  and  Muhammad  Riaz  VS  Federation 

of Pakistan (supra). The petitioners who are similarly placed and similarly 

circumstanced  as  the  departmental  employees  to  whom  the  same  relief 

had been given by the Courts as the one sought in these petitions have a 

right  to  be  given  the  same  relief.  This  relief  should  have  been  given  to 

them by P.T.E.T. and P.T.C.L. and they should not have been made to go 

through the acrimony of litigation. It is well settled that “equal protection 

of law” and “equality before law” means that all persons similarly placed 

should  be  treated  alike.  A  party  who  does  not  litigate  ought  to  be  given 

the same relief/benefit as a similar party who had litigated. Reference in 

this regard may be made to the following case law:- 

(i) 

In  the  case  of  WAPDA  VS  Abdul  Ghaffar  (2018  SCMR  380),  the 

Hon‟ble Supreme Court held the respondents in the said case to be 

entitled  to  the  same  relief  as  had  been  granted  to  a  number  of 

similarly  placed  respondents  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  a  few 

years earlier.  

(ii) 

In  the  case  of  Federation  of  Pakistan  VS  Ghulam  Mustafa  (2012 

SCMR  1914),  it  was  observed inter alia  that  the  pensioners  before 

the  Court  had  to  be  treated  at  par  with  the  pensioners  in  whose 

favour decisions had been given by the Hon‟ble Supreme Court. 

(iii) 

In  the  case  of  Hameed  Akhtar  Niazi  VS  Secretary,  Establishment 

Division (1996 SCMR  1185),  the following  observations  were  made 

by the Hon'ble Supreme Court:- 

“We may observe that if the Tribunal or this Court decides a point 
of law relating to the terms of service of a civil servant which 
covers not only the case of the Civil Servants who litigated, but 
also of other civil servants, who may have not taken any legal 
proceedings, in such a case, the dictates of justice and rule of 
good governance demand that the benefit of the above judgment 
be extended to other civil servants, who may not be parties to the 
above  litigation  instead  of  compelling  them  to  approach  the 
Tribunal or any other legal forum.” 

Law to the said effect has also been laid down in the cases of Tara 

Chand VS Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (2005 SCMR  499), Abdul 

Hameed  Nasir  VS  National  Bank  of  Pakistan  (2003  SCMR  1030),  and 

Government of Punjab VS Samina Parveen (2009 SCMR 1). 

38. 

In  support  of  his  argument  that  the  departmental  employees  were 

not entitled to the increases in pension at the same rate as announced by 

 
 
 
19 

W.P.No.523/2012 

the  Federal  Government  for  the  retired  civil  servants,  much  stress  was 

laid by the learned counsel for P.T.C.L. on the judgment dated 29.11.2017 

passed by the Division Bench of the Hon‟ble Peshawar High Court in writ 

petition  No.2973-P/2012  titled  “Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees 

Union  VS  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Company  Ltd.”  I  have  gone 

through  the said  judgment with great  interest  and  keenness.  In  the said 

judgment,  it  was  held  inter  alia  that  since  after  the  transfer  the 

employees  of  T&T  Department  to  P.T.C.  and  thereafter  to  P.T.C.L.  they 

had not remained civil servants, the increases in pension and revision in 

pay scales etc. announced by the Federal Government  for civil servants 

were  not  applicable  mutatis mutandis  to  such  employees.  With  utmost 

respect  and  reverence  to  the  Hon'ble  Peshawar  High  Court,  I  cannot 

bring  myself  to  agree  with  the  ratio  in  the  said  judgment  since  I  feel 

bound  to  follow  the  law  laid  down  by  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court  in  the 

cases  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees  Trust  (PTET)  VS 

Muhammad Arif (supra), and Muhammad Riaz VS Federation of Pakistan 

(supra). It  may  be  reiterated  that  in  the  case  of  P.T.C.L.  VS  Masood 

Ahmed  Bhatti  (supra)  it  was  held  inter  alia  that  the  departmental 

employees, after their transfer to P.T.C., had not remained civil servants 

but the terms and conditions of their service were provided in Sections 3 

to 22 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 and the same had been protected by 

Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35 and 36 of the 1996 Act. 

39.  Consistent  with  the  law  laid  in  the  judgments  of  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme  Court  in  the  cases  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Employees 

Trust  (PTET)  VS  Muhammad  Arif  (supra)  and  Muhammad  Riaz  VS 

Federation  of  Pakistan  (supra),  I  hold  that  those  petitioners  who  are 

departmental  employees  are  entitled  to  the  payment  of  pension  with 

periodic increases at exactly the same rate as announced by the Federal 

Government for retired civil servants from time to time. Since the pension 

at  the  same  rate  of  increase  as  announced  by  the  Federal  Government 

from  time  to  time  after  2010  has  not  been  paid  to  the  retired 

departmental  employees,  P.T.C.L.  and  P.T.E.T.  ought  to  calculate  the 

arrears  in  pension  payable  to  the  petitioners,  who  are  departmental 

employees, and pay the same to them. 

40. 

In addition to the relief of the increases in pension at the same rate 

as  announced  by  the  Government  for  retired  civil  servants,  some  of  the 

20 

W.P.No.523/2012 

petitioners also seek a declaration to the effect that they are also entitled 

to other retirement benefits that have been granted by the Government to 

retired  civil  servants.  I  shall  deal  with  each  of  such  retirement  benefits 

herein below:-  

Special  additional  pension  (at  the  rate  of  the  orderly  allowance 
announced  by  the  Government  for  in-service  government  servants  in 
BPS-20 and above) 

41.  Vide  office  memorandum  No.F.1(8)-R.4/89,  dated  04.12.1991, 

Regulation  Wing  of  the  Finance  Division  conveyed  the  Government‟s 

decision to approve inter alia retirement benefits for superannuating civil 

servants. Included in such benefits was “additional pension”. Paragraph 

(iii)  of  the  said  office  memorandum  provided  that  retiring  government 

officer in BPS-20, 21 and 22 will be allowed a special additional pension 

equal  to  the  admissible  pre-retirement  orderly  allowance.  The  available 

record shows that the orderly allowance for government officers in BPS-

20  and  above  was  increased  through  the  following  office  memoranda 

issued by the Finance Division:-

42.  As  per  the  Finance  Division‟s  office  memorandum  No.F.1(2)-

Reg.6/91-Vol-IX,  dated  24.12.2012,  by  virtue  of  Finance  Division‟s  office 

memorandum  No.F(1)(2)-Reg.6/91,  dated  29.09.1991,  officers  in  BPS-20 

and above on retirement were entitled to special additional pension equal 

to  the  admissible  pre-retirement  orderly  allowance.  This  facility  was 

further extended to all officers in BPS-20 and above who retired prior to 

19.02.1991  on  the  orders  of  the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court.  The  rate  of 

special  additional  pension  remained  fixed  at  the  rate  prevailing  at  the 

time  of  the  officers‟  retirement  and  was  not  enhanced  with  subsequent 

increases in the rate of orderly allowance. On the basis of the principle of 

equity and fairness, it was decided to approve that the retired officers in 

 
 
 
21 

W.P.No.523/2012 

BPS-20  and  above  shall  be  paid  special  additional  pension  equal  to  the 

orderly  allowance  admissible  to  serving  officers  with  effect  from 

01.01.2013,  and  that  whenever  the  government  revises  the  rate  of 

orderly  allowance  in  the  future,  the  same  increase  shall  be  made 

applicable to the special additional pension of the retired officers. This is 

explicitly  stated  in  the  above-mentioned  Finance  Division‟s  O.M.  dated 

24.12.2012. 

43.  Now, P.T.E.T. approved the enhancement of  the orderly allowance 

to Rs.3,000/- per month from 01.10.2007 in light of the Finance Division‟s 

O.M. dated 29.10.2007. Subsequently,  the P.T.E.T. Board of Trustees, in 

its  63rd  meeting  held  on  27.03.2013,  increased  the  orderly  allowance 

from  Rs.3,000/-  per  month  to  Rs.7,000/-  per  month  with  effect  from 

01.03.2013 for those pensioners who retired before 01.01.1996 in BPS-20 

and  above.  After  this,  P.T.E.T.  has  not  increased  the  rate  of  orderly 

allowance.  

44.  The  principle  under  which  the  retired  departmental  employees 

have  been  held  to  be  entitled  to  the  increase  in  the  rate  of  pension 

commensurate to the increases in the pension announced by the Federal 

Government for civil servants from time to time would also be applicable 

to  the  entitlement  of  the  departmental  employees  to  the  payment  of 

special  additional  pension  at  the  same  rate  as  the  orderly  allowance 

announced and increased by the Government for retired civil servants in 

BPS-20  and  above.  Since  there  is  a  disparity  in  the  rate  of  the  orderly 

allowance  announced  by  the  Federal  Government  and  the  one 

announced  by  P.T.E.T.,  this  disparity  must  be  eliminated  so  that  the 

retired  departmental  employees  of  the  same  grade  as  the  civil  servants 

retiring  in  BPS-20  and  above  are  also  made  entitled  to  the  payment  of 

special  additional  pension  at  the  same  rate  as  the  orderly  allowance 

announced  by  the  Federal  Government  for  civil  servants  in  BPS-20  and 

above.  

Medical allowance 

45.  Vide  O.M.  dated  05.07.2010,  the  Finance  Division  conveyed  to  all 

Ministries/Divisions  the  sanction  of  the  President  of  Pakistan  to  the 

introduction of medical allowance with effect from 01.07.2010 to all civil 

pensioners  of  the  Federal  Government  including  civilians  paid  from 

Defence Estimates and Civil Armed Forces at the following rates:- 

 
22 

W.P.No.523/2012 

(i)  Pensioners who retired in BPS 1 - 15 @ 25% of pension drawn. 
(ii)  Pensioners who retired/will retire in BPS 16 - 22 @ 20 % of pension 

drawn. 

46.  Vide  O.M.  dated  07.07.2015,  the  Finance  Division  conveyed  the 

sanction of the President of Pakistan with effect from 01.07.2015 for 25% 

increase  in  the  amount  of  medical  allowance  being  drawn  by  civil 

pensioners  of  the  Federal  Government  including  civilians  paid  from 

Defence Estimates  and  Civil Armed  Forces  and  to  the  future retirees  on 

the medical allowance admissible to them at the time of retirement.  

47.  Had  the departmental employees  retired  prior to  the  enactment  of 

the  1991  Act,  their  status  as  a  civil  servant  at  that  stage  would  have 

entitled  them  to  the  payment  of  medical  allowance  on  the  basis  of  the 

above-referred  office  memoranda.  Since  the  departmental  employees 

had  not  lost  their  entitlement  to  be  given  all  the  service  benefits  as  are 

entitled  to  civil  servants  by  virtue  of  the  protection  afforded  to  them  by 

Section  9  of  the  1991  Act  and  Sections  35  and  36  of  the  1996  Act,  they 

are  held  to  be  entitled  to  the  payment  of  medical  allowance  with  effect 

from 01.07.2010 at the same rates as mentioned in the Office Memoranda 

dated 05.07.2010 and 07.07.2015. 

Restoration  of  the  Commuted  Portion  of  the  pension  of  the 
departmental employees in the same manner as permissible to civil 
servants 

48.  Mr.  A.A.  Zuberi,  a  retired  Member  of  the  Income  Tax  Appellate 

Tribunal,  had  filed  writ petition  No.2147/2009 before the  Hon'ble  Lahore 

High Court  praying  for  the 50%  of his  commuted  pension  to  be restored 

on  expiry  of  fifteen  years  with  the  increases  allowed  by  the  Federal 

Government.  Vide  judgment  dated  11.02.2009  reported  as  A.A.  Zuberi 

VS Additional Accountant General, Pakistan Revenue, Lahore (2010 PLC 

(C.S.)  1211),  the  said  writ  petition  was  allowed  and  the  respondents  in 

the said writ petition were directed to inter alia “calculate the petitioner‟s 

revived pension amount reflecting the total increases from the date of 

expiry of period of 15 years… and pay the arrears of the said period to 

the petitioner”. It was also held that the petitioner was not entitled to any 

increase prior to the expiry of the fifteen-year commutation period. 

49. 

Intra Court Appeal No.118/2009 filed by the Additional Accountant-

General,  Pakistan  Revenue,  Lahore  against  the  said  judgment  was 

dismissed  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  vide  judgment  dated 

16.06.2010  reported  as  Additional  Accountant  General,  Pakistan 

 
 
 
 
23 

W.P.No.523/2012 

Revenue,  Lahore  VS  A.A.  Zuberi  (2011  PLC  (C.S.)  580).  In  the  said 

judgment,  the  Division  Bench  of  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court,  after 

making reference to and interpreting Rule 3.29 of the Pension Rules, held 

in paragraphs 20 to 22 of the said report as follows:- 

“20. Under the Rules the pension stands RESTORED at the end of the 
commutation period. This means that the respondents are once again 
entitled to 100% pension as it stands on that day. The best index to gauge 
the pension due on the said date is the amount of 50% pension being 
received monthly by the respondents on the said date. The pension due 
will be double the said amount. It is preposterous to imagine that a civil 
servant be given pension in the year 2008 which he was entitled to draw 
in 1993 (15 years ago). Such action offends the right to livelihood of the 
respondents guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution. It also fails 
to meet the test of economic justice which is also an integral part of right 
to life as provided in the preamble and the Objectives Resolution to the 
Constitution. Depriving a civil servant of his lawful pension is also 
discriminatory when compared to equally placed retired civil servants 
who are drawing the current rate of pension. This offends Article 25 of 
the  Constitution.  No  civilized  system  can  provide  for  such  an 
unreasonable  and  uneconomic  post  retirement  benefit  to  their 
employees who have given their golden years for the public service of 
this country.  
21. The interpretation of the appellant on the accounting side also 
appears to be unreasonable. It will be odd for a civil servant to draw two 
different slabs of pensions i.e., 50% at the rate prevalent in the year 1993 
and the remaining on the current rate inclusive of increments.  
22. We, therefore, hold that under Rule 3.29 of the Pension Rules (supra) 
the restoration of pension means the pension due to a retired civil 
servant in that year inclusive of all the increments till that time (i.e. 
accumulated over the last 15 years in this case). In other words it would 
simply be double the amount of 50% pension the respondents are already 
drawing. These appeals are, therefore, dismissed. The order of the 
learned Single Judge is modified/clarified in the above terms.” 

50. 

It is an admitted position that appeals against the above- mentioned 

judgment  of  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  were  dismissed  as  time 

barred.  The  fact  that  the  appeals  were  dismissed  has  also  been 

mentioned in the order dated 24.04.2012 passed by the Hon'ble Supreme 

Court in civil petition No.549/2012.  

51.  A number of civil servants filed appeals before the Federal Service 

Tribunal,  Islamabad  (“F.S.T.”)  seeking  the  benefit  of  periodic  increases 

on the surrendered portion of the commuted value of their pension after 

its  restoration.  The  F.S.T.,  after  taking  into  consideration  the  law  laid 

down  by  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court  in  the  case  of  A.A.  Zuberi  VS 

Additional  Accountant  General,  Pakistan  Revenue,  Lahore  (supra), 

allowed the said appeals vide judgment dated 05.01.2012. The appellants 

before  the  F.S.T.  were  held  to  be  entitled  to  the  increase  in  their 

commuted  pension  at  the  same  rate  at  which  they  were  drawing  the 

 
24 

W.P.No.523/2012 

remaining  50%  pension.  The  Federation  of  Pakistan  assailed  the  said 

judgment by filing civil petitions before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Vide 

order dated 24.04.2012, the said petitions were dismissed.  

52.  The  above-mentioned  litigation  history  was  referred  to  in  the 

Finance  Division‟s  O.M.  dated  21.01.2013.  The  said  O.M.  conveys  the 

Government‟s  decision  to  implement  the  judgment  dated  05.01.2012 

passed by the F.S.T. and upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide order 

dated  24.04.2012  to  the  extent  of  the  parties  to  the  said  litigation.  This 

decision  was  stated  to  be  subject  to  the  outcome  of  a  petition  under 

Article 184(3) of the Constitution which the Government was intending to 

file so that the  said  order  dated  24.04.2012 could  be revisited.  Till date, 

the said order dated 24.04.2012 still holds the field.  

53.  Subsequently,  vide 

letter  No.F.5(2)-Reg.6/2015-1210,  dated 

09.02.2016, the Finance Division conveyed the decision of the competent 

authority  to  allow  the  benefit  of  periodic  increases  on  the  surrendered 

portion  of  the  commuted  value  of  pension  after  restoration  to  those 

pensioners  who  retired  on  or  after  01.12.2001  as  had  already  been 

allowed to the pensioners who retired prior to 01.12.2001 in accordance 

with  the  Finance  Division‟s  office  memoranda  dated  21.01.2013  and 

11.03.2013. 

54.  Since the benefit of the restoration of the commuted portion of the 

pension along with increases therein has been allowed to civil servants, 

the  retired  departmental  employees  would  also  be  entitled  to  the  same 

benefit.  Just  as  the  restoration  of  the  commuted  portion  of  the  pension 

along  with  increases  therein  constitutes  a  part  of  the  terms  and 

conditions  of  a  civil  servant‟s  service,  and  such  benefit  has  been 

bestowed on retired civil servants pursuant to the provisions of the Civil 

Servants  Act,  1973,  the  retired  departmental  employees,  a  portion  of 

whose pension has been commuted, cannot be deprived of its restoration 

with  the  increases  in  pension  at  the  same  rate  as  announced  by  the 

Government for retired civil servants.  

Family pension 

55.  Vide  Finance  Division‟s  O.M.  No.F.2(3)/Reg.6/2010/786,  dated 

05.07.2010,  the  rate  of  the  family  pension  was  increased  from  50%  to 

75% of the gross net pension with effect from 01.07.2010. Family pension 

is being paid to the families  of retired civil servants. Hence, the families 

25 

W.P.No.523/2012 

of  the  retired  departmental  employees  would  also  be  entitled  to  such 

pension.  

56.  The  sheet  anchor  of  the  plea  raised  by  the  petitioners  who  were 

retired departmental employees was that they should be given the same 

pensionary  benefits  as  were  payable  by  the  Federal  Government  to  the 

retired  civil  servants  regardless  of  whether  such  benefits  were  in 

existence  prior  to  or  after  the  enactment  of  the  1991  Act.  Indeed,  it  is 

after  the  enactment  of  the  1991  Act  that  the  Federal  Government  had 

announced  increases  in  pension  for  retired  civil  servants.  Until  2010, 

P.T.E.T.  also  announced  increases  in  pension  at  the  same  rate  as 

announced  by  the  Federal  Government.  In  the  case  of  Pakistan 

Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET) VS Muhammad Arif (supra), 

the  Hon‟ble  Supreme  Court,  after  observing  that  the  departmental 

employees having retired after their transfer to P.T.C. and P.T.C.L. were 

entitled  to  the  same  pension  as  announced  by  the  Government  of 

Pakistan,  held  that  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  P.T.E.T. “is bound to follow 

such announcements of the Government in respect of such employees”. 

The  departmental  employees  being  successful  in  their  challenge  to  the 

disparity created by the decisions of P.T.E.T. and P.T.C.L. in the increase 

in  pension  for  such  employees  with  the  increase  in  pension  announced 

by  the  Federal  Government  for  retired  civil  servants,  implies  that  such 

employees were entitled to all those retirement or pensionary benefits to 

which a retired civil servant was entitled. The protection as to the terms 

and  conditions  of  the  service  given  to  the  departmental  employees  by 

Section 9 of the 1991 Act is not confined to pensionary benefits. There is 

no  denying  the  fact  that  the  departmental  employees  prior  to  their 

transfer  to  P.T.C.  were  civil  servants.  Had  there  been  no  such  transfer, 

they would have been entitled to be paid not just the increases in pension 

at  the  same  rate  as  announced  by  the  Federal  Government  for  retired 

civil  servants  but  also  all  other  retirement  and  pensionary  benefits  as 

were  being  given  or  introduced  by  the  Federal  Government  for  retired 

civil  servants  of  the  same  category,  and  on  such  terms  as  they  were 

made payable.  

57.  The increase in the rate of pension has no distinguishing feature as 

a  retirement  benefit  from  other  retirement  benefits.  The  periodic 

increases in the rate of pension announced by the Federal Government is 

26 

W.P.No.523/2012 

as  much  a  retirement  benefit  as  medical  allowance,  special  additional 

pension  (at  the  rate  of  the  orderly  allowance  announced  by  the 

Government  for  in-service  government  servants  in  BPS-20  and  above), 

family  pension,  and  the  restoration  of  the  commuted  portion  of  the 

pension  of  the  departmental  employees 

in  the  same  manner  as 

permissible  to  civil  servants.  Of  course,  the  conditions  fixed  by  the 

Government for making such payments have to be satisfied. To hold that 

the  departmental  employees  are  entitled  to  the  increases  in  pension  at 

the same  rate as announced by the Federal Government for retired civil 

servants  but  not  to  the  other  retirement  or  pensionary  benefits 

introduced or made payable to retired civil servants, would in my opinion, 

be most unjust.  

58. 

It is not P.T.E.T. or P.T.C.L.‟s case that the increases in pension or 

the other retirement benefits referred to herein above are not granted to 

the  retired  civil  servants  under  the  provisions  of  the  Civil  Servants  Act, 

1973. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in no uncertain terms that the 

terms and conditions of the departmental employees would be governed 

by  Sections  3  to  22  of  the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  by  virtue  of  the 

protection afforded to them by Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35 

and  36  of the 1996  Act.  Therefore,  such  departmental  employees  would 

be  entitled  to  all  those  retirement  benefits  which  are  granted  by  the 

Government  to  retired  civil  servants  pursuant  to  the  said  provisions  of 

the  Civil  Servants  Act,  1973  and  on  such  terms  as  they  are  allowed  to 

civil servants of an equivalent grade. As mentioned above, Section 9(2) of 

the  1991  Act  provides  that  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  of  the 

departmental  employees  upon  their  transfer  to  P.T.C.  “shall not be 

varied”  to  their  disadvantage.  To  give  the  retired  departmental 

employees lesser retirement benefits than those made admissible by the 

Government  to  retired  civil  servants  would  be  placing  such  retired 

departmental  employees  in  a  disadvantageous  position,  which  is  not 

countenanced  by  the  mandate  of  Section  9(2)  ibid.  Just  as  P.T.C.  was 

prohibited  by  Section  9(2)  of  the  1991  Act  from  varying  the  terms  and 

conditions  of  service  of 

the  departmental  employees 

to 

their 

disadvantage,  in  the  same  way  Section  36(2)  of  the  1996  Act  also 

prohibited  P.T.C.L.  from  altering  adversely  the  terms  and  conditions  of 

service  of  such  employees.  The  adoption  of  the  words  “shall not be 

27 

W.P.No.523/2012 

altered adversely”  in  Section  36(2)  conveys  a  prohibition  unless  of 

course  it  is  with  the  consent  of  such  employees  and  on  award  of 

appropriate compensation.  

59.  Since by reason of the transfer of the departmental employees they 

had  lost  the  status  of  civil  servants,  but  had  certainly  not  lost  their 

entitlement to be given all the service/retirement benefits by virtue of the 

protection afforded to them by Section 9 of the 1991 Act and Sections 35 

and  36  of  the  1996  Act,  they  are  held  to  be  entitled  to  the  payment  of 

other retirement benefits including medical allowance, special additional 

pension  (at  the  rate  of  the  orderly  allowance  announced  by  the 

Government  for  in-service  government  servants  in  BPS-20  and  above), 

family  pension,  and  the  restoration  of  the  commuted  portion  as  paid  by 

the Government to retired civil servants of an equivalent category. 

60.  There are several petitioners who do not come within the category 

of “departmental employees”.  These  petitioners  were  not  transferred  to 

P.T.C.  by  operation  of  Section  9  of  the  1991  Act  but  were  employed  in 

P.T.C. after the enactment of the said Act.  

61. 

It  needs  to  be  determined  whether  those  petitioners  who  were 

employed  in  P.T.C.  after  the  enactment  of  the  1991  Act  could  agitate  a 

grievance regarding the terms and conditions of their service before this 

Court in its Constitutional jurisdiction. The answer to this question would 

depend  on  whether  the  terms  and  conditions  of  such  an  employee  of 

P.T.C.  are  governed  by  statutory  rules  or  regulations.  If  such  rules  or 

regulations are not statutory, the principle of 'master and servant' would 

govern  the  relationship  between  the  employee  and  the  employer 

organization.  In  the  case  of  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Company 

Limited  VS  Iqbal  Nasir  and  others  (PLD  2011  S.C.  132),  it  has  explicitly 

been  held  that  the  Pakistan  Telecommunication  Corporation  Service 

Regulations, 1996 framed pursuant to Section 20 of the 1991 Act, had not 

been  notified  in  the  official  Gazette.  Since  the  said  Regulations  did  not 

have  a  statutory  status,  the  employees  of  P.T.C.  employed  after  the 

enactment  of  the  1991  Act  and  governed  by  the  said  Regulations  could 

not agitate a dispute regarding the terms and conditions of their service 

(including their right to receive pension) by filing a petition under Article 

199  of  the  Constitution.  Therefore,  the  writ  petitions  filed  by  such 

petitioners are liable to be dismissed on that score alone. 

28 

W.P.No.523/2012 

62.  One  of  the  petitioners  in  writ  petition  No.1419/2018  (Mst.  Mukhtar 

Begum  Sheikh  widow  of  Sheikh  Ghulam  Mohiuddin),  and  one  of  the 

petitioners  in  writ  petition  No.1638/2018  (Mst.  Farzand  Begum  widow  of 

Tikka  Khan)  are  the  widows  of  employees  of  the  T&T  Department  who 

retired on 01.04.1979 and 01.12.1979, respectively. They are seeking for 

the  increase  in  the  rate  of  the  family  pension  at  the  same  rate  as  was 

increased  by  the  Federal  Government  for  retired  civil  servants.  The 

husbands of the said petitioners had retired as civil servants prior to the 

enactment  of  the  1991  Act.  Since  the  liability  of  pension  as  regards  the 

retired  employees  of T&T Department had shifted  onto P.T.C.E. Pension 

Fund  and  subsequently  to  P.T.E.T.,  I  hold  that  P.T.E.T.  was  under  an 

obligation  to  increase  the  family  pension  for  the  families  of  the  retired 

employees  of  T&T  Department  at  the  same  rate  as  increased  by  the 

Federal Government for retired civil servants.  

63.  This  Court  cannot  grant  relief  to  the  retired  employees  of  P.T.C.L. 

who have not invoked the jurisdiction of this Court. This judgment  would 

operate  in  personam.  The  relief  not  expressly  prayed  for  by  the 

petitioners, who are departmental employees, in their petitions cannot be 

granted to them.  

64. 

In view of the above, the writ petitions listed in "Schedule-A" hereto 

are disposed of in the following terms:- 

i. 

The  petitions 

to 

the  extent  of 

the  petitioners  who  were 

departmental  employees  i.e.  employees  who  were  employed  in 

P.T.C.  after  the  enactment  of  the  1991  Act,  and  who  retired  from 

service  prior  to  or  after  the  enactment  of  the  1996  Act,  are 

dismissed as not maintainable.  

ii. 

The  petitions  filed  by  the  petitioners  who  opted  for  V.S.S.  and 

received  benefits  thereunder  were  dismissed  as  withdrawn  vide 

orders dated 20.02.2020 and 25.02.2020. The petitions to the extent 

of  the  petitioners  who  have  availed  the  benefits  of  V.S.S.  are 

dismissed as not maintainable.  

iii 

The  petitions  filed  by  the  petitioners  who  are  departmental 

employees  (i.e.  the  employees  of  T&T  Department  who  were 

transferred to P.T.C. and further transferred to P.T.C.L. by virtue of 

the  provisions  of  the  1991  Act  and  1996  Act)  praying  for  the 

payment  of  pension  with  increases  at  the  same  rates  paid  by  the 

29 

W.P.No.523/2012 

Federal  Government  to  the  retired  civil  servants  from  time  to  time 

are  allowed.  P.T.C.L.  and  P.T.E.T.  are  directed  to  calculate  the 

arrears in pension payable to such petitioners, and pay the same to 

them within a period of sixty days from the date of the receipt of this 

judgment. 

iv 

The  petitions  filed  by  the  petitioners  who  are  departmental 

employees  praying  for  the  payment  of  medical  allowance,  special 

additional pension (at the rate of the orderly allowance announced 

by the Government for government servants in BPS-20 and above) 

family pension and the restoration of the commuted portion of their 

pension  in  the  same  manner  as  permissible  to  civil  servants,  are 

allowed. P.T.C.L. and P.T.E.T. are directed to calculate the arrears 

in such retirement benefits to such petitioners, and pay the same to 

them within a period of sixty days from the date of the receipt of this 

judgment. 

v.  

The  relief  granted  herein  above  shall  not  be  applicable  to  those 

petitioners  who  opted  for  and  obtained  benefits  under  any  of  the 

Voluntary Separation Schemes announced by P.T.C.L. Writ petition 

No.1675/2019,  wherein  the  petitioners  having  opted  for  the  V.S.S. 

were  being  paid  pension  but  were  seeking  an  increase  in  their 

pension at the same rate  as announced by the government for  the 

civil  servants,  has  been  de-clubbed  from  the  petitions  listed  in 

"Schedule-A"  hereto  and  shall  be  decided  on  its  own  merits.  Writ 

petitions  No.1419/2018,  1638/2018,  4588/2018,  2587/2017,  and 

1066/2019  were  dismissed  as  withdrawn  vide  orders  dated 

20.02.2020 and 25.02.2020 to the extent of the petitioners who had 

opted for and received benefits under the V.S.S.  

vi.  No costs.
