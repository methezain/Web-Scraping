Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and 
that  of  parties  or  counsel  where 
necessa  . 
Mr.  Muhammad  Ashfaq  Shahid,  Advocate 
for the  petitioner. 
Mr.  Tariq  Mahmood  Tarar,  Advocate  for 
respondent No.3 to  6. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition  filed 

under Article  199  of  the  Constitution  of  Islamic 

Republic of  Pakistan, 1973,  the  petitioner  has 

assailed 

judgments 

and  decrees  dated 

01.02.2021 and 08.12.2020,  passed by learned 

Additional  District  &  Sessions Judge-III,  East- 

Islamabad  and  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

East-Islamabad,  respectively,  whereby  family 

suit 

filed  by  contesting 

respondents  was 

decreed and appeal was dismissed. 

02.  Succinctly stated,  facts mentioned in  the 

writ  petition  are  that  respondents  No.3  to  6 

filed  suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  which 

2 

Writ  Petition  No.2613 0(2021 

was  partially  decreed in  favor  of  respondents. 

The  petitioner  contracted  marriage  with 

respondent  No.  3,  according  to  the  Muslim 

Rites  and  Ceremonies.  From  the  wedlock, 

three  children  respondents  No.4  to  6  were 

born  who  were  studying 

in  government 

schools in  Class  7,  3  &  1  respectively. They are 

getting  free  education. The  suit  was contested 

by  the  petitioner  but  the  learned  trial  Court 

without  going  through  and  appreciating  the 

material  evidence of  the  petitioner  passed  an 

interim  order  for  payment  of  Rs.  10,000/-  per 

month for each  minor. 

03. 

After  recording  the  evidence,  learned 

trial  Court has  passed  impugned judgment  and 

decree  dated  08.12.2020,  whereby,  suit  of 

respondents No.3  to  6  to  the  extent  of  dowry 

articles  of  Rs.  80,000/-,  recovery  of  monthly 

maintenance of  respondent No.3  at the  rate of 

Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  from  the  date  of 

institution  of  suit  till  Iddat  period  and  to  the 

extent 

of  maintenance 

allowance 

of 

respondent  No.4 

to  6  at  the  rate  of  Rs. 

10,000/-  per month for  each  minor from  March 

3 

Writ Petition No.2613 of2021 

2019 

till 

their 

legal  entitlement  with  10Â°/o 

annual increase, was decreed. 

04. 

The  petitioner  filed  an  appeal  against 

the  judgment  and decree which  has  also been 

dismissed  by  the  Court  of  learned  Additional 

District  &  Sessions  Judge-III,  East-Islamabad 

vide  judgment  and  decree  dated  01.12.2021. 

Against  the  concurrent  findings  of  both  the 

learned  lower  Courts,  the  petitioner  has  filed 

the  instant writ  petition. 

05. 

Learned counsel for  the  petitioner,  inter 

alia,  contends 

that  both 

the 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  passed  by 

learned 

lower Courts are not sustainable in  the  eyes of 

law as  the  learned Courts below badly failed to 

consider  the  important  facts  of  law,  hence 

both the  impugned judgments  and decrees are 

liable to  be  set aside. 

06. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  contesting 

respondents  has  controverted  the  arguments 

advanced by  learned counsel for  the  petitioner 

and  stated  that 

impugned  judgments  and 

decrees are passed  in  accordance with  law and 

evidence  produced  by  the  parties;  in  the  writ 

4 

Writ Petition No.2613 of2021 

petition 

concurrent 

findings 

cannot 

be 

interfered  and  has  prayed  for  dismissal  of 

instant writ  petition. 

07. 

Arguments advanced by learned counsel 

for  the  petitioner  and  learned  counsel for  the 

respondents  No.3  to  6  have  been  heard  and 

record  has  been  perused  with 

their  able 

assistance. 

08. 

The  petitioner  being 

father  of 

the 

minors  is  bound to  pay maintenance;  deciding 

of  Rs.  10,000/-  per  month  for  each  minor  is 

very  nominal;  the  petitioner  is  also  liable  to 

pay  maintenance  to  his  ex-wife 

from  her 

desertion 

till 

Iddat  period; 

the  amount 

regarding  dowry  articles  was  also  decided 

according to  evidence produced by  the  parties. 

09. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

contesting 

respondents  has  also  pointed  out  that  the 

petitioner  has  not  paid 

the  maintenance 

according  to  impugned  judgments  I  decrees 

and  learned  executing  court  has  issued  arrest 

warrants of the  petitioner. 

10. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has 

failed 

to  point  out  any 

illegality 

in 

the 

5 

Writ Petition No.2613 0(2021 

impugned judgments and  decrees.  It  is  well 

settled  that  certiorari  is  only  available  to 

quash a  decision for  an  error  of  law.  It  will 

also  be 

issued  for  correcting  errors  of 

jurisdiction  when  an 

inferior  Court  or  a 

tribunal acts without jurisdiction  or  in  excess 

of  its  jurisdiction,  or  fails  to  exercise  its 

jurisdiction  or  where the  Court or  a  tribunal 

acts  illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and 

it  decides  a  matter 

in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural  justice. 

The  High  Court  while  issuing  a  writ  of 

certiorari acts in  exercise of  supervisory and 

not  appellate jurisdiction.  The  High  Court in 

exercise of  its writ jurisdiction will  not review 

the  findings of  facts  reached by  the  inferior 

Court or a  tribunal.  In  this  regard, reliance is 

placed upon the cases titled  as  Amjad Khan 

VS  Muhammad  Irshad 

(Deceased) 

through  LRs,  (2020  SCMR  2155), 

President  All 

Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt 

VS 

Muhammad Akbar  Awan  and  others 

(2020  SCMR  260 J.  Chief  Executive

and  others  (2019  SCMR 919),  Chairman, 

NAB  VS  Muhammad  Usman  and  others

Muhammad  Siddique  and  2  others  (PLO 

2007SC45J. 

11. 

Further, there  are concurrent  findings of 

both  the  learned  Courts  below  against  the 

petitioner.  In  case  of concurrent findings of the 

courts  below,  scope  of 

the  constitutional 

petition  becomes very  limited.  The  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  any  misreading or  non  

reading of the  evidence. It  has  been laid  down 

in  a  case  titled  as 

''Syed Arif  Ali  Sabri  VS 

Abdul  Samad through  L.Rs. and 2 others" 

(2008  YLR 2309 l'  that: 

"When there are concurrent findings 

of  Courts below,  the  scope of  the 

constitutional 

petition 

for 

interference is very limited  and it  can 

only be interfered  when the orders of 

the  Courts  below  are  fanciful  or 

based on misreading or  non-reading 

of the evidence". 

7 

Writ  Petition  No.2613 0(2021 

The  same view  has  also .been  taken  in  a  case 

titled  as  ''Sadruddin VS  Aslam Madad Ali 

and others" fPLD 2008 Karachi 2005). 

12. 

For  what  has  been  discussed  above, 

impugned 

judgments  and  decrees  dated 

01.02.2021 and 08.12.2020, passed by learned 

Additional  District  &  Sessions Judge-III,  East- 

Islamabad  and  learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

East-Islamabad, 

respectively, 

are 

in 

accordance with  law  and  facts  of  the  matter, 

hence do  not  require  any  interference  by  this 

Court. 

13. 

In  view  of  above  prospective, 

the 

instant  writ  petition  has  no  merits  and  the 

same is  dismissed with  no order as  to costs.
