Proceedings 

06.08.2020  Ms.  Imaan  Zainab  Hazir  Mazari,  Advocate 

for  petitioner. 
Mr.  Abid  Hussain  Chaudhry,  Advocate  for 
respondent  No. l. 
Mr.  Muhammad  Naieeb  Malik,  Advocate 
for  respondent  No.2. 

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  of refusal. 

to  exercise 

jurisdiction 

by 

respondent  

No.1  pursuant 

to  the  application  made  by 

her. 

2. 

The  facts,  in brief,  are  that  petitioner 

is  married  to  respondent  No.2  and  in  this 

behalf 

Nikah 

was 

solemnized 

on 

17.10.2014.  The  petitioner 

executed  a 

Divorce  Deed  pursuant 

to  alleged 

right 

delegated 

to  her  by  respondent  No.2  under 

clause 

18 

of 

Nikah 

Nama. 

A 

letter/application  was  made  to  respondent 

No.1  for 

further 

action 

in  the  matter; 

however, 

respondent  No.1  declined 

to 

exercise  the  jurisdiction  on  the  basis  that 

there  is  no  valid  delegation  of  right  to 

I 

pronounce  divorce  and  secondly, 

it  has  1o 

territorial  jurisdiction  in the  matter

3. 

Learned  counsel 

for  the  petitioner, 

inter  alia,  contended 

that 

at  present, 

petitioner 

is  residing 

in  Islamabad  hence 

respondent  No.1  has 

jurisdiction 

in  the 

matter  in  light  of  law  laid  down  by  Hon'ble 

Lahore  High  Court 

in  case 

reported  as 

"Syed  Muhammad  Ali Raza  VS  Province  of 

Punjab,  through  DCO  Lahore  and  others' 

(2016  YLR  15).  It  was  contended 

that 

even-otherwise, 

respondent 

No.2 

delegated 

the  right  to  petitioner 

to  divorce 

to  petitioner 

and  on  the  basis 

thereof, 

Divorce  Deed  was  executed  and  request 

was  made  to  respondent  No.1  to  conclude 

the  matter. 

4. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

respondent 

No. l, 

inter  alia,  contended 

that  bare 

reading  of  Clause  18  of  Nikah  Nama  shows 

that  no  valid  delegation  has  been  made  by 

respondent  No.2.  It  was  contended 

that 

even-otherwise, 

respondent  No.1  does  not 

have  jurisdiction  in  the  matter  inasmuch  as 

she  does  not  reside  in Islamabad. 

5. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

respondent 

No.2,  inter  alia,  contended 

that  copy  of 

Nikah  Nama,  appended  with  writ  petition, 

is 

tampered 

inasmuch 

as  no 

right  of 

divorce  was 

ever  delegated 

to 

the 

petitioner. 

In 

this  behalf,  he  produced 

original  Nikah  Nama  for  perusal  of  the 

Court  and  also  placed  on  record  copy  of 

the  same.

6. 

Arguments 

advanced 

by 

learned 

counsels  for  the  parties  have  been  heard 

and 

the  documents, 

placed  on  record, 

examined  with  their  able  assistance. 

7. 

The  facts,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petition, 

have 

been 

mentioned 

hereinabove, 

hence 

need 

not 

be 

reproduced. 

8. 

As 

noted 

above, 

petitioner 

is 

aggrieved  of  letter  dated  17.06.2020  by 

respondent  No. l.  The  referred  respondent 

refused 

to  exercise  its  authority  on  two 

counts;  firstly  no  valid  right  of  divorce  has 

been  delegated 

and  secondly, 

it  has  no 

jurisdiction  in the  matter. 

9. 

Nikah  Nama  between  the  parties  was 

registered  at  D.G.  Khan,  however, 

at 

present, 

it  seems  that  petitioner 

is  residing 

in  Islamabad  as 

is  borne  out  from 

the 

address  provided  in the  Divorce  Deed. 

10.  The  Hon'ble  Lahore  High  Court,  m 

case 

reported 

as  "Syed  Muhammad  Ali 

Raza  VS  Province  of  Punjab,  through  DCO  

Lahore 

and  others' 

(2016  YLR 

15), 

observed  as  follows> 

"7.  Under section  B  of  the  Muslim  Family 

Laws  Ordinance,  1961  a  wife  who  has  been 

delegated the right  of divorce by the husband, can 

pronounce  divorce  by  invoking  the  provisions  of 
section  7  and  under  subsection  (1)  of  which  a 

notice  in  writing  has to  be sent  to  the  Chairman, 

Union  Council and  under  Rule 3{b)  of  the  West 

Pakistan  Rules  made  under  the  Muslim  Family 

Laws Ordinance, 1961, such notice  has to  be sent 

to  the union council of the union where the wife in 

relation  to  whom  Talaq has been pronounced  was 

/,P  Nn 17H~'020 

4 

residing  at  the  time  of  the  pronouncement  of 
Talaq.  The interpretation  of the above  clause leads 
this Court to an irresistible conclusion that  since it 
is  the  place  of  residence  of  the  wife  where  the 
Nikahnama  is  registered,  therefore,  in  case  of 
divorce by  the  wife  with  delegated  powers  by  the 
husband  the  notice  has  to  be  sent  to  the  union 
counsel  where  Nikah  was  registered.  More  so, 
since it is not  the  case of the petitioner  that  notice 
should  have  been  sent  to  the  union council where 
the  husband  was  residing  as  the  Talaq  was 
pronounced  by  the  wife  to  the  husband.  The only 
objection  raised  by  the  petitioner  is  that  it  is  the 
place of residence of the  wife where the  notice has 
to be sent  under the  delegated  right of divorce by 
the  wife  herself.  I  am  afraid,  this interpretation  is 
not in  accordance with the spirit of the statute  and 
in  line with the intention  of the  legislature as it will 
be entirely against the convenience of a woman. 

9(sic) In  this view of the matter,  no illegality 
was committed  by respondent  No.2 who has issued 
the certificate of effectiveness  of the divorce which 
does  not  require interference  while  exercising the 
constitutional jurisdiction  under  Article 199 of the 
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 
as a result of which this petition  is dismissed". 

11. 

In  light  of  above  judgment  and  Rule 

3(b)  of  the  Rules  framed  under  Muslim 

Family  Laws  Ordinance,  1961,  a  Union 

Council,  where  wife 

resides,  has 

the 

authority/jurisdiction 

to  arbitrate 

in  the 

matter 

and 

also 

to 

issue  Divorce 

Certificate.  Respondent  No.1  erred 

in 

holding  that  it  is  the  place  of  Nikah  Nama, 

which  has 

the  authority 

in  the  matter; 

even-otherwise, 

respondent  No. l  was 

required 

to  verify 

from 

the  petitioner 

about  her  residence  in  order  to  assume 

jurisdiction.

12. 

In  so  far  as  the  issue  of  delegation 

'IJJ 

respondent  No.2  the  right  of  divorce 

to  the 

petitioner, 

there 

is  a  controversy 

of 

fact 

inasmuch  as  the  petitioner  believes 

that  a  valid 

right  has  been  delegated 

to  her,  whereas  same 

is  denied  by  respondent  No.2.  Even-otherwise, 

copy  of Nikah  Nama  appended  with  writ  petition 

has  the  words  "0  ~ 

..byt  ~fi"  whereas  copy 

of  Nikah  Nama  produced 

in 

the  Court  oy 

respondent  No.2 

against  Clause-18, 

it 

is 

mentioned 

"d  ~  ~" 

The  controversy 

can 

only  be  resolved  by 

the  courts  of  plenary 

jurisdiction  which  are  competent 

to  take  down 

evidence. 

13. 

In  such  view  of  the  matter,  with  respect 

to  issue  whether  a  valid  right  of  divorce  has 

been  delegated 

to  the  petitioner, 

she  may 

approach  the  courts  of  plenary  jurisdiction 

to 

have 

the  matter 

resolved,  whereas  on  the 

issue  of  territorial 

jurisdiction, 

respondent 

No.1  erred,  however,  said  error  has  no  avail 

or  advantage 

to  the  petitioner 

inasmuch  as 

the  controversy 

regarding  delegation  of  right 

of  divorce 

still  exists 

and  can  only  be 

resolved 

by 

the 

forum 

of 

competent 

jurisdiction. 

14.  The  instant  petition  is  disposed  of  with 

above  observations.
