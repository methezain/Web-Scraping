S. No. of 
order/ 
proceedings 
01. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Date of  
order/

03.06.2021  Mr.  Muhammad  Jamil  Malik,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner.

Through  the 

instant  petition,  the 

petitioner 

has 

challenged 

order 

dated 

26.03.2021,  passed  by 

learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-II  (Guardian),  East-Islamabad,  whereby 

right  of  the  petitioner  to  file  written  statement 

was struck off. 

 2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends 

that 

the 

law 

favours 

adjudication  on  merits 

rather 

than  on 

technicalities, no proper opportunity for filing of 

written  statement  was  provided 

to 

the 

petitioner.  Learned  counsel  further  contends 

that  learned  Trial  Court  was  supposed  to  allow 

the  petitioner  to  file  the  written  statement  and 

after  framing  of  issues,  decide  the  matter  in 

accordance  with  law,  hence  impugned  order  is 

liable  to  be  set-aside  as  it  is  not  tenable  under 

the law.
