Advocate 

Sagheer 

Ahmad 

for 

 FIAZ  AHMAD  ANJUM  JANDRAN,  J.-  Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition,  petitioner  assails 

order dated 31.12.2019, passed by respondent 

No.  1/learned  Single  Bench  of  the  National 

Industrial 

Relations 

Commission-NIRC, 

whereby 

in  C.M.A.  No.24 

{322/2019}, 

transfer/posting  orders  dated  26.12.2019  and 

28.12.2019  of  private  respondents  have  been 

suspended. 

2. 

During  pendency  of 

the  present 

petition,  petitioners 

filed 

two 

separate 

applications {C.M.As. No.300 and 464 of 2020}, 

through  which 

subsequent 

orders 

of 

respondent No.1/ learned Member NIRC dated 

20.01.2020 and 29.01.2020 have been brought 

under  question.  Vide  order  dated  20.01.2020, 

Chief  Personal  Officer 

and  Divisional 

Superintendent of petitioner-Pakistan Railways 

have  been  summoned  to  appear  in  person 

while 

through 

the  second  order  dated 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.23 of 2020 

                                                          -2- 

29.01.2020,  contempt  proceedings  have  been 

initiated.  The  main  petition  and  the  C.M.As. 

{supra}  are  being  decided  through  this  single 

order. 

3. 

  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contends  that  Full  Bench  of  the  NIRC  is  not 

available  hence,  instant  writ  petition  has  been 

filed  against  the  orders  passed  by  learned 

Member,  NIRC/respondent  No.1. 

Impugned 

orders  are  patently  illegal,  quorum  non-judice 

as final relief has been granted under the garb 

of  injunctive  order;  that  private  respondents 

are holding the executive positions and are not 

covered  within  the  definition  of  workman;  that 

they  are  holding  the  same  post  for  the  last 

fourteen  years  and  now  transferred;  said 

transfer  orders  have  been  assailed  before 

learned  respondent  No.1.  Learned  counsel  in 

support  of  his  submissions  placed  reliance 

upon  case  law  reported  as PLD 1997 SC 351, 

PLD 1983 Karachi 303, 2002 CLC 601, 2017 

PLC 176, 1984 PLC 1480, 2014 PLC CS 275, 

and 2017 PLC 130.  

4. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

private 

respondents  contends 

that 

interlocutory 

orders  are  not  appealable,  forum  is  available, 

no  final  adjudication  had  been  made  and 

therefore, petition is not maintainable. Learned 

counsel  refers  case  law  reported  as  1996 

SCMR 1165, 1998 SCMR 328, 2019 YLR 618, 

2014 CLD 415, and 1986 PLC 105 and  seeks 

dismissal of instant writ petition.

                                                          -3- 

5. 

Heard  the 

learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  and  examined  the  record  with  their 

able assistance. 

6. 

First  objection  by 

the  contesting 

respondents  is  that  proceedings  are  pending 

before  respondent  No.1  and  petitioner  is  at 

liberty  to  advance  any  ground  before  him, 

because  no  appeal  before  learned  Full  Bench 

of  NIRC  against 

interlocutory  orders 

is 

provided  and  writ 

jurisdiction  cannot  be 

exercised 

in  respect  of  said 

interlocutory 

orders.  

7. 

When  record  examined,  it  transpires 

that  petitioner  had  filed  appeal  against  the 

impugned order before the learned Full Bench 

of  NIRC  and  it  was  numbered  as  Appeal 

No.12(03)/2020  with  C.M.A.  No.24  (06)/2020 

which  was  not  heard/adjudicated  by 

the 

learned  Full  Bench 

for  want  of  quorum, 

therefore,  instant  writ  petition  was  filed.  The 

provision  of  law  which  provides  remedy  of 

appeal to the petitioner is Section 58 of I.R.A., 

2012 which reads as under:- 

58.    Appeals.—(1)  Notwithstanding 
anything contained in this Act, or in any 
other law for the time being in force, any 
person  aggrieved  by  an  award  or 
decision given or a sentence or order 
determining and certifying a collective 
bargaining unit passed by any Bench of 
the Commission, may, within thirty days 
of  such  award,  decision,  sentence  or 
order  prefer  an  appeal  to  the 
Commission. 

(2)    An  appeal  preferred  to  the 
Commission under sub-section (1) shall 
be disposed of by the Full Bench of the 
Commission which shall– 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.23 of 2020 

                                                          -4- 

(a)      if the appeal is from an order 
determining and certifying a collective 
bargaining  unit,  have  the  power  to 
confirm, set aside, vary or modify such 
an order. 

(b)     if the appeal relates to any other 
matter, the Full Bench may, confirm, set 
aside, vary or modify the decision or 
sentence passed and shall exercise all 
the powers required for the disposal of 
an appeal. 

(c)      The decision of the Full Bench shall 
be  delivered  as  expeditiously  as 
possible, within a period of sixty days 
following  the  filing  of  the  appeal, 
provided that such decision shall not be 
rendered invalid by reasons of any delay 
in its delivery. 

(d)     The Full Bench may, on its own 
motion at any time, call for the record of 
any case or proceedings under this Act 
in which a Bench within its jurisdiction 
has passed an order for the purpose of 
satisfying itself as to the correctness, 
legality, or propriety of such order, and 
may pass such order in relation thereto 
as it thinks fit: 

               Provided that no order under this 
sub-section shall be passed revising or 
modifying any order adversely affecting 
any person without giving such person a 
reasonable opportunity of being heard. 

(3)     In an appeal preferred to it against 
the order of a Bench directing the re-
instatement of a workman, the Full Bench 
may make an order staying the operation 
of the order of the Bench. 

(4)     The Full Bench shall decide such 
appeal within twenty days of its being 
preferred: 

Provided  that,  if  such  appeal  is  not 
decided within the period aforesaid, the 
stay order of the Full Bench shall stand 
vacated on the expiration of that period.

8. 

Needless 

to  mention 

that  appeal 

relating  to  determination  and  certifying  a 

collective  bargaining  unit  is  provided  under 

Section 58(2)(a) of the I.R.A., 2012 while in any 

other  matter  appeal 

is  provided  through 

Section  58(2)(b)  of  the 

I.R.A.,  2012.  The 

intention of the legislature when is considered, 

interpreted,  construed  on 

the 

relevant 

principles,  it  provides  that  legislature  had 

provided 

appeal 

in 

respect 

of 

any 

proceedings, 

other  matters 

and 

not 

specifically excluded interlocutory orders from 

Appellate  Jurisdiction  vested  in  the  learned 

Full Bench of NIRC under the I.R.A., 2012. 

9. 

There  are  number  of  special 

laws/ 

enactments  which  are  helpful  to  consider 

intent  of  legislature  to  clear  this  point,  but  I 

restrict myself only to the extent of three edicts 

of legislature which are as under:- 

i-  Financial Institutions (Recovery of  
Finances)  Ordinance,  2001,  {FIO 
2001} 

ii-  The Family Courts Act, 1964 {Act of 

1964} 

iii-  The  Islamabad  Rent  Restriction, 
Ordinance, 2001 {IRRO, 2001} 

10. 

On  examination  of  the  provisions  of     

(i) ‗FIO 2001‘ it reveals that remedy of appeal 

is  provided  under  Section  22,  wherein 

expressly  words  have  been  used  that  appeal 

against  a  judgment,  decree,  sentence  or  final 

order  is  provided  and  through  the  provision 

22(6) interlocutory order has been excluded.  

   The  same  course 

is  adopted 

in             

(ii)  ‗Act  of  1964‘  wherein  appeal  has  been 

 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.23 of 2020 

                                                          -6- 

provided under Section 14 of Act of 1964 and 

specific  exclusion  regarding 

interlocutory 

orders  has  been  provided  through  sub  clause 

3 of the said provision of law i.e. Section 14 of 

the Act of 1964.  

    This  sequence  can  also  be  witnessed 

from  (iii)  the  ‗IRRO,  2001‘  wherein  Section 

21 (1) provides  right of appeal to an aggrieved 

party  by  a  final  order  of  a  Controller,  while 

clause    2  of  Section  21  specifically  bars  filing 

of  appeal  against  an 

interlocutory  order 

passed by the Controller.  

11. 

Same  is  the  position  in  many  other 

statutory  provisions  but  to  elucidate  the 

concept  for  construction,  this  Court  limits 

to the above three examples and holds that 

when  legislature  had  not  provided  any 

exclusion  regarding  interlocutory  orders 

through  Section  58  of  the  I.R.A.  2012, 

rather  through  sub  clause  (b)  of  Section 

58(2) provided appeal relating to any other 

matter, decision or sentence passed, it can 

be  safely  construed 

that 

interlocutory 

orders  are  also  amenable  to  the  appellate 

jurisdiction  of  learned  Full  Bench  of  the 

NIRC under section 58(2)(b).  

12. 

Now  when  learned  Full  Bench  is  not 

available 

for  want  of  quorum, 

in 

that 

eventuality 

this  Court  has  constitutional 

jurisdiction  to  rescue  an  aggrieved  party  for 

redressal  of  his  grievances  during 

this 

interregnum  that  no  one  is  being  rendered 

remediless,  particularly  when  a  remedy  is 

 
 
 
W.P. No.23 of 2020 

                                                          -7- 

provided  by  the  legislature.  In  the  light  of 

above  discussion,  the  objections  regarding 

incompetency  of  learned  Full  Bench  of  the 

NIRC  to  adjudicate  upon  interlocutory  orders 

in Appellate Jurisdiction  and maintainability of 

the  instant  petition  when  the  learned  Full 

Bench is not functional, are repelled.  

13. 

It  is  observed  that  private  respondents 

are  holding  the  positions  which,  prima-facie, 

does not fall within the definition of ―workman‖ 

and, 

therefore, 

impugned  order  dated 

31.12.2019,  is  not  legally  sustainable.  Since 

the  first 

impugned  order  retains  no 

legal 

backing,  the  subsequent  two  orders  dated 

20.01.2020  and  29.01.2020  being  offshoot 

would also be treated alike.  

14. 

In  the 

light  of  above,  operation  of 

impugned 

orders 

dated 

31.12.2019, 

20.01.2020  &  29.01.2020 

shall 

remain 

suspended  till  the  availability  of  learned  Full 

Bench of NIRC. It is made clear that whenever 

learned Full Bench is available this order shall 

cease to exist. 

15. 

The  instant  writ  petition  is  disposed  of 

in  above  terms.  The  observations  recorded 

hereinabove  shall  have  no  impact  upon merits 

of  the  case,  to  be  decided  by  the  learned  Full 

Bench of NIRC.
