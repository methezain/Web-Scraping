CIVIL JUDGE, EAST, ISLAMABAD and others 

Petitioner by 

:  Mr. Imran Feroze Malik, Advocate. 

Respondent by 

:  Mr. Shafqat Ghafar Khan Joyia, Advocate. 

(for Respondent No.2) 

Date of hearing   

:

SAMAN RAFAT IMTIAZ, J.:-     Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor  [Khawar  Shahzad]  has  assailed  Orders  dated 

11.01.2022 & 20.01.2022 (“Impugned Orders”) passed by learned Judge Family 

Court-East,  Islamabad  (“Executing  Court”)  whereby  application  filed  by  the 

Petitioner seeking permission  for  payment of  decretal amount in installments has 

been  dismissed  while  local  commission  has  been  ordered  to  ascertain  current 

market  value  of  the  gold  ornaments  and  letter  for  blockage  of  CNIC  of  the 

Petitioner/Judgment Debtor has been ordered to be sent to D.G. NADRA. 

2. 

Facts, in brief as per the Memo of Petition, are that an execution petition was 

filed  by  the  Respondent  No.2/Decree  Holder  [Humaira  Bashir]  to  execute    the 

Judgment  and  Decree  dated  23.05.2017,  whereby  the  learned  Family  Court  had 

determined the value of gold ornaments and dowry  articles to be Rs.1,083,125/-.  

3. 

The  Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor  filed  an  application  seeking  permission  to 

submit  the  decretal  amount  in  installments  in  respect  of  which  the  following 

Impugned Order dated 11.01.2022 was passed:  

The  judgment  debtor  has  filed  an  application  for  payment  of  decretal  amount  through 
installments. It appears that he wants to pay alternative amount of gold ornaments rather 
than  7.5 tolas gold  ornaments.  In present  circumstances,  stenographer of this  Court  is 
appointed  as  local  commission  to  ascertain  the  market  value  of  7.5  tolas  gold 
ornaments  and  he  is  directed  to  submit  his  report  on  next  date  of  hearing.  Record 
transpires that judgment debtor has already paid about Rs.580,000/- in lieu of decretal 
amount.  Considering  the  application  of  judgment  debtor,  he  is  directed  to  pay 
Rs.250,000/- on next date of hearing. In case of non-compliance of payment he shall be 
proceeded as per law. [Emphasis added]. 

4. 

The learned Executing Court vide Impugned Order dated 20.01.2022 issued 

non-bailable  warrants  of  arrest  in  the  name  of  Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor  as  he 

 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

W.P. No.275/2022 

was  not  present  and  also  letter  for  blockage  of  CNIC  of  the  Petitioner/Judgment 

Debtor was sent to the D.G. NADRA. 

5. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor,  inter  alia,  contended 

that the Impugned Orders  are bad in law,  untenable, ex-facie based upon whims 

and  caprice;  that  learned  Executing  Court  erroneously  assumed  that  the  alternate 

value  of  gold  is  outstanding;  that  the  learned  Executing  Court  failed  to  take  into 

consideration  that  the  Petitioner  has  been  paying  the  amount  in  view  of  which  

Impugned  Orders  dated  11.01.2022  &  20.01.2022  are  harsh  and  oppressive;  that 

the Petitioner only earns Rs. 50,000/- per month and as such cannot afford to pay 

the  outstanding  amount  lump  sum;  that  the  learned  Executing  Court  cannot  go 

beyond  the  decree  and  change  the  decretal  amount;  that  the  Impugned  Orders  is 

against  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  hence  same  are  liable  to  be  set-

aside;  and  that  valuable  rights  are  involved  in  the  instant  matter  as  huge  amount 

has  already  been  paid  to  the  Respondent  No.2.  The  Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor 

through instant petition seeks setting aside of Impugned Orders dated 11.01.2022 

&  20.01.2022  and  to  allow  the  Petitioner/Judgment  Debtor  to  pay  the  amount 

outstanding  out  of  the  earlier  fixed  decretal  amount  i.e.  Rs.  1,083,125/-  in 

installments as per financial capacity of the Petitioner. 

6. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondent  No.2/Decree  Holder 

vehemently  opposed  the  arguments  advanced  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Petitioner and submitted that the Impugned Orders are tenable. He submitted that 

the instant petition is without any merit as there is no illegality and infirmity in the 

Impugned  Orders.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  Respondent  No.2/Decree  Holder 

relied upon the case of Haji Muhammad Nawaz VS Samina Kanwal, 2017 SCMR 

321. 

7. 

Arguments advanced by the learned counsels for the parties have been heard 

and record examined with their able assistance. 

8. 

There is no cavil to the proposition that where decree of delivery of gold or 

its market value is granted the market value should be determined with reference to 

the date of payment as held by the Honouarble Supreme Court in case Mst. Ayesha 

Shaheen VS Khalid Mehmood, 2013 SCMR 1049. 

9. 

Be  that  as  it  may,  the  alternate  value  of  gold  was  admittedly  fixed  at 

Rs.335,600/-  while  value  of  the  dowry  articles  was  fixed  at  Rs.  747,525/- 

aggregating to Rs. 1,083,125/-.  Whereas, on the date of the Impugned Order dated 

 
 
3 

W.P. No.275/2022 

11.01.2022  the  Petitioner  had  admittedly  paid  about  Rs.580,000/-  towards  the 

decretal amount which is more than the alternate value of the gold ornaments. The 

learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  correctly  pointed  out  that  there  is  no  way  to 

ascertain  whether  the  payment  made  was  towards  payment  of  alternate  value  of 

gold  ornaments  or  the  value  of  dowry  articles.  Therefore,  on  the  date  of  the 

aforementioned Impugned Order, it could not be concluded that the value of gold 

ornaments was outstanding and the learned Executing Court erred in holding that 

market  value  of  7.5  tola  gold  ornaments  would  be  ascertained  as  per  date  of 

payment.  

10.  The case of Mst. Ayesha Shaheen (Supra) relied upon by the learned counsel 

for  the  Respondent  No.2/Decree  Holder  is  distinguishable  as  despite  lapse  of  12 

years  not  a  single  amount  had  been  paid  toward  the  adjustment  of  the  decree  in 

such case.  Whereas in the instant case, as noted herein above, the Petitioner has 

already paid more than the value of the gold ornaments. 

11. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant  petition  is  partly  allowed  and  the 

Impugned  Order  dated  11.01.2022  is  hereby  modified  only  to  the  extent  that  the 

amount  admittedly  paid  by  the  Petitioner  shall  be  treated  as  including  payment 

toward  the  alternate  value  of  gold  and  such  value  shall  not  be  revised.    The 

outstanding amount for the value of dowry articles shall be paid as per direction of 

the learned Executing Court. 

12.  With  regard  to  the  Impugned  Order  dated  20.01.2022  no  illegality  or 

infirmity of law has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the Petitioner so as 

to call for interference by this Court, hence to the extent of Impugned Order dated 

20.01.2022, instant petition being devoid of any merits is hereby dismissed.  

Announced in the open Court on 16th of May, 2022.
