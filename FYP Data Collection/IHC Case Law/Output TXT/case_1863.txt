24.01.2019  Mr. Khalil-ur-Rehman Abbasl, Advocate  for
petitioner.
M/s Saira Khalid Rajput and Dur-e-Najaf,
Advocates for respondent  No.3.

Through the  instant writ  petition, the
petitioner, Asad Nawaz, impugns the judgment
dated 03.10.2018,  passed  by the Court of the
learned Additional  District Judge, lslamabad,
whereby his appeal against the order  dated
22.05.2018, passed by the learned Judge,  Family
Court, lslamabad,  was dismissed. Vide the said
order dated 22.05.2018, the learned  Family Court
dismissed the petitioner's  application  for setting-
aside the ex-parte judgment and decree dated
05.01 .2018, whereby  the suit for recovery  of
dower,  maintenance  and dowry articles instituted
by respondent No.3 (Ms. Ayesha  Aadil), was
decreed.

\r 2.  Learned  counse! for the petitioner  submitted

that the learned Courts  below did not appreciate
that the petitioner had come-up with sufficient
cause for  the setting-aside  of  the ex-parte
judgment and decree dated  05.01 .2018;  that the
Reader of the learned Family Court had mislead
the petitioner as to the whereabouts  of the case
file and as to the correct  date of hearing;  that the
petitioner  was informed that the next date of
hearing in the proceedings  before the learned
Tria! Court was 15.01 .2018; that when the

U

W.P.  No.386212018

petitioner  attended the Court on 15.01 .2018,  he
was informed that the suit against him had already
been decreed; that soon thereafter, the petitioner
filed an application  for the recal! of the ex-parte
judgment and decree dated 05.01 .2018; and that
the learned Trial Court did not appreciate that the
petitioner  had come-up with sufficient  cause for
not attending the Court on 20.'12.2017. Learned
counsel for the petitioner  prayed for the writ
petition to be allowed and for the concurrent
orders/judgments  passed by the learned Courts
below  to be set-aside.
3.  On the other hand, learned counsel  for
respondent  No.3 submitted  that respondent  No.3
had filed a suit for recovery of dower, etc. on
30.09.2014; that vide order dated  27.02.2015, the
petitioner was proceeded  against ex-parte;  that on
29.O9.2O15,  an ex-partejudgment  and decree  was
passed in  respondent  No.3's favour; that
subsequently, on the petitioner's  application,  the
said ex-parte  judgment  and decree  was set-aside
subject to the payment  of costs to the tune of
Rs.5,000/-; that the  petitioner deliberately
absented himself from the learned Trial Court  on
20.12.2017;  that the order sheet of the learned
Trial Court clearly shows that on 13.12.2017,  the
matter had been adjourned to 20.12.2017; that
even prior to that the petitioner  had protracted  the
proceedings before the learned  Trial Court by not
filing a written statement; that the petitioner had
not come-up with any sufficient  cause for the
recall of the ex-parte judgment  and decree dated
05.01 .2018; and  that  the  concurrent
orders/judgments  passed by the learned Courts
below do not suffer from any jurisdictional

infirmity so as to warrant  interference  in the
Constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.
4.  ! have heard  the contentions  of the learned
counsel for the contesting parties and have
perused the record with their able assistance.

5.  The record shows that on 25.10.2008, the
petitioner and respondent  No.3 got married.
Subsequently,  the relations between  the couples
turned sour. The marriage between  the said
parties  came to an end after respondent  No.3
exercised her right of divorce delegated to her in
terms of column No.18 of the Nikahnama. The
divorce  between the parties  was finalized  on
05.09.2012.

6.  On 30.09.2014,  respondent  No.3 filed a suit
for recovery of dower, maintenance  and dowry
articles.  Since the petitioner did not appear before
the learned Family Court despite  the publication of
summons in the newspaper, he was proceeded
against ex-parte  on 27.02.2015. After recording
ex-parte evidence,  the learned  Family Court,  on
29.09.2015,  passed an ex-parte judgment  and
decree  in respondent  No.3's  favour.

7.  Vide order dated 24.1O.2O17,  the petitioner's
application for setting-aside  the said ex-parte
judgment  and decree was allowed  by the learned
Family Court subject to payment of costs to the
tune of Rs.5,000/-. Since the petitioner  again failed

to appear  before the learned  Family Court,  he was
proceeded against  ex-parte on  20.12.2017.
Respondent No.3's  evidence recorded  earlier  (i.e.
prior to the ex-parte judgment and decree  dated
29.09.2015) was treated as her evidence and the
proceedings  culminated in  another  ex-parte

\y

W.P. No.386212018

judgment and decree dated 05.01 .2018 in
respondent  No.3's  favour.
8.  On 19.01 .2018, the petitioner filed an
application  under Section 9(6) of the West
Pakistan  Family Courts  Act, 1964 ("the 1964 Act")
praying for the order dated 20.12.2017 and the ex-
parte judgment and decree dated 05.01.2018,  to
be set-aside. The ground taken in the said
application  was that the petitioner  had been
misinformed by the Reader  of the learned Family
Court as to the correct date of hearing.  Vide order
dated 22.05.2018, the learned Family Court
dismissed the said application.

9.  The said order dated 22.05.2018  as well as
the  ex-parte judgment and  decree dated
05.01 .2018 were assailed  by the petitioner  in an
appeal before the Court of the learned Additional
District Judge, lslamabad.  Vide judgment  dated
03.10.2018,  the learned Appellate Court dismissed

the said appeal.

10. The vita! question  that needs to be answered
is whether the learned Family Court lawfully
exercised its discretion  while dismissing  the
petitioner's application for the setting aside of the
order dated 22.05.2018, whereby  the petitioner's
application  for setting aside lhe ex-parte judgment

and decree, was dismissed.

11. Now every litigant is presumed to be aware of
the contents of the order sheet of the suit
maintained  by the Trial Court. Perusal of the order
dated  13.12.2017, passed  by the learned  Trial
Court shows that the matter had been  adjourned

to 20.12.2017.  ln this view of the matter,  there was
no reason for the petitioner to have absented

w

W.P.  No.386212018

himself from the learned Family Court on
20.12.2017.  Even if the petitioner  could not have
tendered  appearance  on the said date, his counsel
should  have appeared  before the learned  Family

Court on the said date.
12. Even prior to 20.12.2017,  the order sheet
reveals that the case had been adjourned  on
several occasions at the petitioner's instance.
Since the suit instituted by respondent  No.3 had
earlier been decreed ex-parte.  the petitioner
should have been extra vigilant and attended the

Court on every date of hearing  either personally or
through his counsel. The petitioner  had not even
bothered  to deposit  the costs of Rs.5,000/- subject
to which the earlier ex-parfe judgment and decree
dated  29.O9.2O15. Given the said conduct of the
petitioner,  it cannot be held that the discretion  by
the learned Courts below in concurrently non-
suiting  the petitioner was exercised  unlawfully or
arbitrarily. Respondent  No.3's case against  the
petitioner  was supported by evidence which
remained un-rebutted.

13. ln view of the above, I have no reason to hold
that the concurrent  orders/judgments  passed  by
the learned Courts  below suffer from jurisdictional
errors so as to warrant interference in the
Constitutional jurisdiction of  this  Court.
Consequently, this petition is dismissed  with no
order as to costs.
