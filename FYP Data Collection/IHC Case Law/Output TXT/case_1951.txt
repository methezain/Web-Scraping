for 

Aamer Farooq, J. 

The 

petitioner 

is 

aggrieved  of  order  dated  11.03.2005, 

whereby  he  was  dismissed  from  service  by 

respondent No.2.       

2. 

The  petitioner  joined  respondent  No.2  in 

the  year  1976,  however,  was  absent  from 

duty  due to his family commitments  and as a 

result thereof was dismissed from service vide 

impugned  order  dated  11.03.2005  passed  by 

respondent No.2 under Printing Corporation of 

Pakistan (PCP) Employees Service Rules, 1977 

read  with  rule  15(2)  of  West  Pakistan 

Industrial 

and  Commercial  Employment 

(Standing  Orders)  Ordinance,  1968  and 

Presidential  Special  Power  Ordinance,  2000. 

The  petitioner  assailed  the  referred  order 

before  Federal  Service  Tribunal  (FST)  vide 

Appeal  No.2078(R)(CE)/2005  which  was  held 

to be incompetent and liable to be abated vide 

order dated 13.11.2012 in light of the decision 

of  the  Apex  Court  reported  as  ‘PLD  2006  SC 

602’, 

therefore, 

the 

aforementioned 

 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                               2                                                     {W.P.No.4167/2012} 

termination  order  has  been  assailed  in  the 

present Constitutional petition.       

3. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter  alia  submitted  that  in  light  of  the 

judgement  passed  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court  of  Pakistan  reported  as  ‘2013  SCMR 

1707’,  where  there  is  violation  of  law,  the 

Constitutional  petition  is  maintainable;  in  the 

present  case,  the  impugned  order  has  been 

passed  under  Removal  from  Service  (Special 

Power)  Ordinance,  2000,  however,  section  5 

of  the  referred  Ordinance  has  not  been 

adhered  to  inasmuch  as  no  inquiry  was 

conducted.  The 

learned  counsel 

further 

contended  that  the  petitioner  was  availing 

remedy  before  the  Federal  Service  Tribunal 

(FST)  and  the  proceedings  before  it  were 

abated  due  to  the  aforementioned  judgement 

of  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan, 

therefore, the instant Petition is not barred by 

laches.  

4. 

The learned counsel for  respondent No.2 

inter  alia 

submitted 

that 

the 

instant 

Constitutional  petition  is  not  maintainable  as 

the  Printing  Corporation  of  Pakistan  (Pvt.) 

Limited  Employees  Service  Rules  1977  are 

non-statutory.  It  was  further  contended  that 

the  instant  Constitutional  petition  is  also  not 

maintainable  as  respondent  No.2  is  a  Private 

Limited  Company  and  does  not  fall  in  the 

definition of a person carrying on the affairs of 

the Federation; the petitioner was issued show 

cause notice at his address and also the same 

was  published  in  the  newspaper  i.e.  ‘Daily 

Nawa-i-Waqt’ 

on  20.02.2005 

but 

the  

petitioner  did  not  respond  to  the  same, 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                               3                                                     {W.P.No.4167/2012} 

therefore,  respondent  No.2  was  left  with  no 

option but to pass an order in accordance with 

the rules and law. The learned counsel placed 

reliance on sections 3(1)(a) as well as 5(4) of 

Removal 

from  Service 

(Special  Power) 

Ordinance, 

2000, 

to 

substantiate 

his 

contention  that  the  respondent  No.2  acted  in 

accordance  with 

law.  In  support  of  his 

contentions, 

the 

learned  counsel  placed 

reliance  on  case  titled  as  “Syed  Nazir  Gillani 

VS  Pakistan  Red  Crescent  Society”  (2014 

SCMR  982),  “Muhammad  Nawaz  VS  Civil 

Aviation  Authority” 

(2011  SCMR  523), 

“Dawood  Cotton  Mills  Ltd.  VS  Guftar  Shah” 

(PLD  1981  SC  225)  &  “Zeba  Mumtaz  VS  First 

Women Bank Ltd.”  (PLD 1999 SC 1106).          

5. 

The  rules  governing  service  of  the 

petitioner are non-statutory as the same have 

been  framed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of 

respondent  No.2  which 

is  a  Company 

incorporated under the Companies Ordinance, 

1984,  therefore,  the  relationship  between 

respondent  No.1  and  the  petitioner  is  that  of 

master  and  servant  as  has  been  held  by  the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan 

in 

numerous  judgments.  In  this  behalf,  the  case 

law  cited  by  respondent  No.2  is  instructive.         

In  case  titled  “Syed  Nazir  Gillani  VS  Pakistan 

Red  Crescent  Society”  (2014  SCMR  982) 

supra, it was observed by the Apex Court that 

it  is  well  settled  that  the  rules  framed  by 

Pakistan  Red  Crescent  Society  are  non-

statutory  and  on  that  account,  the  Writ 

petition was not maintainable. In the  referred 

judgment, reliance was also placed on another 

case  relied  by  the  petitioner  i.e.  “Pakistan 

Defence  Officers  Housing  Authority  VS  Lt. 

 
 
 
 
                                                                               4                                                     {W.P.No.4167/2012} 

Col.Syed  Javed  Ahmad”  (2013  SCMR  1707), 

wherein  it  was  held  that  where  conditions  of 

service  of  employees  of  a  Statutory  body  are 

not  regulated  by  rules  /  regulations  framed 

under the Statue but only rules or instructions 

issued  for  its  internal  use,  any  violation 

thereof  cannot  generally  be  enforced  through 

Writ jurisdiction and would be governed by the 

principle of master and servant.  

6.   Similarly,  in  PLD  1999  SC  1106  supra, 

the  Hon’ble  Apex  Court  observed  that  in  the 

absence  of  any  Statutory  Rules,  relationship 

between  the  employer  and  employee  of  a 

corporation is that of master and servant.        

7. 

On  the  basis  of  above  judgments,  the 

question  that  needs  determination  is  whether 

there  is  violation  of  any  law  on  the  part  of 

respondent  No.2  in  passing  the  impugned 

order.  Respondent  No.2 

terminated 

the 

petitioner  under  inter  alia  section  3(1)(a)  and 

5(4)  of  the  Ordinance  ibid.  In  this  behalf, 

section  3(1)(a)  empowers  the  employer  to 

terminate  the  services  of  an  employee  where 

the  employee  has  habitually  remained  absent 

from service. Under section 5, the inquiry is to 

be  conducted  before  proceedings  to  pass  the 

termination  order,  however,  by  virtue  of 

section  5  (4)  ibid,  the  referred  rule  is  not 

absolute  and  the  Competent  Authority  can 

dispense with inquiry, if it deems proper in the 

circumstances  on 

the  basis  of  evidence 

available.  In  the  present  case,  the  petitioner 

was  charge  sheeted  and  show  cause  notice 

was also issued to him and  its publication was 

also made in  the newspaper  but the petitioner 

did  not  respond  to  the  same  and  in  such 

circumstances,  respondent  No.2  was  left  with 

 
 
 
 
 
                                                                               5                                                     {W.P.No.4167/2012} 

no  option  but  to  pass  the  termination  order. 

Therefore,  there  is  no  violation  of  law  on  part 

of respondent No.2.   

8. 

In  view  of  foregoing  discussion,  the 

present  Writ  Petition  is  incompetent  and  is 

hereby dismissed.
