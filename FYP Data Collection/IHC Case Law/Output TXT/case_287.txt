ARBAB  MUHAMMAD  TAHIR,J.:-  Through  the  instant 

writ  petition,  petitioner  namely  Adeel  Javed  (defendant  in  main 

suit) 

impugns  orders  dated  16.02.2013,  11.09.2014  and 

08.05.2015,  passed  by 

the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court, 

Islamabad (East).  

02. 

Vide 1st order, right of the petitioner to cross-examine the 

plaintiff/PW was struck-off in following terms:- 

“16.02.2013. Case called.   Plaintiff is present alongwith her 
counsel.  Today  matter  was  fixed  for  cross-examination  of 
plaintiff but neither defendant appeared nor did his counsel 
appear.  Therefore,  the  right  of  defendant  to  cross-examine 
the  plaintiff/PW  is  struck  off.  Adjourned  to  25.03.2013  for 
documentary evidence as well as evidence of defendant.”  

03. 

For  recalling  of  the  order  ibid,  petitioner  filed  an 

application  which  was  dismissed  due  to  his  non-appearance  vide 

order  dated  25.09.2013.  However,  on  the  subsequent  date  of 

24.02.2014, it was allowed subject to payment of costs of Rs.500/-.  

The  respondent  No.2  namely  Mst.  Hina  Sadiq  (hereinafter  to  be 

referred as ‘respondent’) then filed an application for setting aside 

order  dated  20.02.2014,  which  was  allowed  vide  order  dated 

11.09.2014,  inter  alia,  observing  that  “due  to  concealment  of 

learned counsel for defendant, court presumed that learned counsel 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 2 – 

WP No. 1675 of 2015 

for  the  applicant/plaintiff  gave  his  no  objection  after  recalling 

order  dated  16.02.2013.”  The  matter  was  then  set  for  hearing  of 

application  for  recalling  of  order  dated  16.02.2013  and  vide  order 

dated  08.05.2015,  the  application  for  recalling  of  order  dated 

16.02.2013 was dismissed, hence instant writ petition. 

04. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  argued  that  as  per  the 

dictums  laid  down  by  the  superior  courts,  the  cases  should  be 

decided  on  merits  instead  of  technical  knockout;  that  before 

resorting  to  penal  action,  no  coercive  measures  were  adopted  and 

the  right  of  the  petitioner  to  cross-examine  the  plaintiff  was 

straightaway  closed;  that  the  impugned  action  is  violative  of 

principle of fair trial envisaged in Article 10-A of the Constitution; 

that there was no deliberate omission regarding non-appearance on 

the  part  of  the  petitioner;  that  right  of  cross-examination  being  a 

precious right could not be taken lightly particularly when there is 

no express provision to close the said right under the West Pakistan 

Family  Court  Act,  1964  (‘Act  of  1964’)  and  that  under  the 

principle  of  natural  justice  and  fair  trial,  petitioner  should  be 

afforded  an  opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  respondent  and  her 

witnesses  in  order  to  decide  the  case  on  merits.  Learned  counsel 

fortified his submissions by placing reliance upon case law reported 

as  2006  SCMR  789,  2016  SCMR  2082,  PLD  1969  SC  270,  PLD 

1973  SC  222,  1990  CLC  703,  2001  YLR  2415,  PLJ  2004  Lahore 

1080, 2022 YLR 293 and 2022 CLC 953. 

05. 

On  the  other  hand,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent 

repelled  the  above  submissions  by  placing  on  record  written 

synopsis-arguments and also argued the case at length, gist whereof 

had  been  that  the  conduct  of  the  petitioner  throughout  the 

proceedings  debars  him  to  ask  for  setting  aside  of  the  impugned 

order; that the proceedings remained at-halt for more than a decade 

in  a  suit  which  otherwise is  to be decided within six  months;  that 

the  application  of  the  petitioner  did  not  contain  any  plausible 

 
 
 
 
 
- 3 – 

WP No. 1675 of 2015 

reason;  that  the  petitioner  attempted  to  mislead  the  court  and  that 

the  conduct  of  the  petitioner  debars  him  to  ask  for  extra  ordinary 

relief under constitutional jurisdiction. Learned counsel relied upon 

case law reported as 2014 SCMR 1365, 2014 CLC 715, 2021 CLC 

270,  2010  YLR  308,  2013  CLC  32.  2004  CLC  703  and  2010  YLR 

336. 

06. 

Hear, record perused. 

07. 

The parties are in contest over claim of the respondent for 

the  recovery  of  dower  amount  besides  10  tola  gold  ornaments, 

dowry  articles  and  maintenance  allowance,  agitated  through  suit 

filed  on  15.10.2011.  After  notice,  the  petitioner  filed  written 

statement on 13.03.2012 and the issues were framed on 20.03.2012.  

08. 

As  per  the  “FACTUAL  BACKGROUND”  contained  in 

written  submissions  placed  on  file  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondent  after  framing  of  issues  on  20.03.2012,  the  case  was 

adjourned  for  about  11 

times 

i.e.  14.04.2012,  28.04.2012, 

02.06.2012,  16.07.2012,  08.09.2012,  15.09.2012,  02.10.2012, 

02.11.2012,  04.01.2013,  15.01.2013  and  26.01.2013  respectively. 

On  three  dates,  the  proceedings  could  not  be  conducted  either  on 

account of a Conference or due to non-availability of the Presiding 

Officer  while  once  the  case  was  transferred  and  entrusted  to  the 

Court of Senior Civil Judge (East) while on rest of the dates, notice 

pervi were issued either to the parties or to the petitioner.  

09. 

According to the petitioner, on the date 16.01.2013 (before 

the crucial date of 16.02.2013), petitioner was cautioned to cross-

examine the witnesses on the next date otherwise the right to cross-

examination will be closed. In order to appreciate this stance of the 

petitioner  contained  in  written  arguments  at  page  No.5,  the 

proceedings  conducted  by  the  learned  Trial  Court  available  on 

record  has  been  perused  whereby  it  reveals  that  the  stance  of  the 

respondent that the court had specifically directed the petitioner to 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 4 – 

WP No. 1675 of 2015 

cross-examine the witnesses or else his right of cross-examination 

will  be  closed,  is  misconceived  as  no  such  caution  is  available  in 

order dated 26.01.2013 wherein it was mentioned that “counsel for 

the defendant is directed to cross-examine the PW on the next date 

of  hearing  of  case.  Adjourned  to  16.02.2013  for  evidence  of  the 

plaintiff.”  

10. 

As  mentioned  above,  there  was  no  specific  notice  to  the 

petitioner that in case of his failure to cross-examine the plaintiff or 

her witnesses, his right of cross-examination will be struck off. In-

addition,  no  coercive  measures  like  imposition  of  cost  and 

provision of absolute last opportunity were adopted by the learned 

Trial Court which, if seen in context of nature of the claim set for in 

plaint  and  counter  response  contained  in  written  statement,  was 

essential.   The mischief on the part of the petitioner is not of such a 

caliber that could be made basis to permanently preclude him from 

contesting the claim  of the respondent whereby  she sought decree 

for  recovery  of  Rs.5-Lac  as  dower  amount,  Ten  Tola  Gold 

Ornaments,  Rs.3-Lac  in  lieu  of  dowry  articles  along  with  interest 

12%  per  annum  from  the  date  of  marriage  till  realization  of  the 

amount,  past  maintenance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  20,  000/-  per  month  

from  June,  2011  till  filing  of  suit  at  the  rate  of  Rs.  20,000/-  and 

present and future maintenance at the same rate with increase at the 

rate of  15% per annum. 

11. 

The proceedings of the Family Court, whether it be a Trial 

Court  or  an  Executing  Court,  are  governed  by  the  principles  of 

equity,  justice  and  fair  play  as  laid  down  by  the  Hon’ble  Apex 

Court in case of “Haji Muhammad Nawaz v Samina Kanwal”(2017 

SCMR 321). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 5 – 

WP No. 1675 of 2015 

12. 

A  Family  Court  is  a  quasi-judicial  forum,  which  could 

draw and follow its own procedure, provided such procedure is not 

against  the  principles  of  fair  hearing  and  trial.  Reliance  is  placed 

upon “Muhammad Tabish Naeem Khan v Additional District Judge 

Lahore  &  other”  (2014  SCMR  1365).  The  Code  of  Civil 

Procedure except Sections 10 & 11 is not applicable but the Judge 

Family  Court  is  not  debarred  to  follow  the  principles  of  the  Code 

1908  and  could  also  draw  and  follow  its  own  procedure  provided 

the same is not against the principles of fair hearing and trial. Right 

to fair trial is a fundamental right envisaged in Article-10-A of the 

Constitution.    In  the  present  case,  as  observed  above,    the  Family 

Court  should  take  into  consideration  the  peculiar  facts  and 

circumstances  of  the  case  besides  the  claim  and  counter  response 

and  before  taking  penal  action,  should  have  adopted  coercive 

measures  and  could  also  burden  the  petitioner  with  the  costs  in 

order  to  evaporate  apprehension  of  causing  prejudice  to  the  rights 

of  any  of  the  parties,  before  closing  right  to  cross-examine  the 

respondent  and  her  witnesses  which  if  left  unattended  would 

amount  to  negation  of  principle  of  nature  justice,  equity  and  fair 

play,  the  principles  on  the  basis  of  which,  the  proceedings  of 

Family  Court  rest  as  laid  down  in  the  case  of  Haji  Muhammad 

Nawaz supra.  

13. 

The  impugned  orders,  in  the  backdrop  of  facts  and 

circumstances  highlighted  above,  are  not  legally  sustainable.  It  is 

necessary to  mention that the parties are in contest in a suit under 

the Family Court Act, 1964 (W.P. XXXV of 1964) (‘Act of 1964’) 

which warrants expeditious disposal as for the purpose, provisions 

of  Quanun-e-Shahadat  Order  1984  (P.O.  No.10  of  1984)  and  the 

Code  of  Civil  Procedure  except  Sections  10  and  11  have  been 

excluded  to  achieve the legislative intent. A  specific timeframe of 

six  months  has been provided for the decision of a case under the 

Act  of  1964  in  terms  of  Section  12(A)  of  the  Act  of  1964  while 

 
 
 
 
- 6 – 

WP No. 1675 of 2015 

period of four months is stipulated under Section 14(A) of the Act 

of 1964 for decision of an appeal.  

14. 

In  view  of  above,  instant  writ  petition  is  allowed, 

impugned  orders  dated  16.02.2013,  11.09.2014  and  08.05.2015, 

are set aside and the petitioner is afforded an opportunity to cross-

examine  the  respondent  and  her  witnesses  subject  to  payment  of 

costs of Rs. 10, 000/- to be paid to the respondent. 

15. 

Before  parting  with  the  order,  it  is  deemed  necessary  to 

mention that  the suit  was filed in October,  2011 and is  still  at the 

stage  of  recording  evidence  of  the  parties  which  is  to  be  decided 

within a period of six months in terms of Section 12(A) of the Act 

of  1964,  therefore,  the  learned  Trial  Court  shall  make  every 

endeavour to conclude the trial of the subject case expeditiously 

and decide the same at the earliest. Copy of this order be sent to 

the learned Trial Court for compliance.
