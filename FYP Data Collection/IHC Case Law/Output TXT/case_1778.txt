MOHSIN AKHTAR  KAYANL  J: Through  the instant writ petition,  the

petitioners  have  assailed  judgments  and decrees dated  06.03.2077 and  03.07'2017,

passed by the Courts below,  to the extent  of maintenance  allowance only' which

has been prayed to be enhanced to the tune  of Rs.10,000/- per month.

2.  Brief facts referred in the instant  writ petition  are that on 19.01.2004, Dil

Jan/petitioner  No.l- contracted  marriage with Malik Altat/tespondent  No'1
against  dower to the tune of Rs.50,000/-, and from the said wedlock

Hamzaf  petitioner No.2 was born on 18'10.2005'  However,  due to strained

relationship between the spouses,  resPondent No.L contracted  second  marriage

in the year  2006 and got disappeared,  who in the year 2012 turned  up and

informed his family  elders that he has divorced  petitioner No.L vide divorce

deed dated  01.01.2012, though respondent  No'L failed to pay maintenance

allowance  to the petitioners  and dower  to petitioner No'L, which constrained the

petitioners to file suit for recovery of maintenance  and dower'  The suit was

contested  by other side and eventually the learned Judge  Family Court (West)'

Islamabad  vide the impugned judgment  and decree dated 06.03.2017  partly

d.ecreed  the suit in favour  of the petitioners.  Feeling  aggrieved thereby, both the

sides  preferred their  respective appeals,  which were dismissed  by the learned

Pase | 2

Additional  District Judge-VII (West), Islamabad vide impugned  judgment  and

decree dated 03.07.2017.  Hence,  the instant writ petition.

3. 

Learned counsel  for petitioners  contended that impugned judgments  and

decrees to the extent  of maintenance  allowance  in favour of petitioners  have  been

passed in a hasty and arbitrary manner;  that the findings to the extent of

awarding  maintenance are based  on presumption,  surmises and conjectures

resulting  into grave miscarriage  of justice; that the impugned  judgments  and

decrees to the extent of maintenance  allowance are the result  of mis-reading  and

non-reading  of evidence and facts of the case as the petitioners had prayed  for

maintenance  allowance  to the tune of Rs.10,000/-  each per month, therefore, the

impugned  judgments  and  decrees may be set-aside  to the extent  of maintenance

awarded  and the maintenance  allowance may be enhanced  as prayed  for by the

petitioners.

4. 

Arguments  heard,  record perused.

5.  Perusal of record reveals that a notice was issued to Muhammad

Altaf/Respondent  No.1 through Special Messenger,  who submitted  a detailed

report  that Respondent  No.1  was contacted  on his mobile No.0321-5200735,  who

stated that he is shifted to Karachi. However, when the said Special  Messenger

went to serve the notice at given address of Respondent  No.1 in Rawalpindi,  his

cousin  namely Shahid not merely  acknowledged  that Respondent No.L asked

him not to receive the notice but also confirmed that Respondent  No.1 has

misstated  that he is shifted to Karachi,  rather  he is in Rawalpindi,  therefore,

respondent  No.L is proceeded ex-parte for deliberately refusing to receive the

notice, and as such,  since the instant matter  pertains to maintenance  allowance,

the same is hereby  taken  up for today.

6. 

It has been  observed from  the available  record that petitioner  No.L was

married to respondent  No.L on 19.01.2004  against  Haq Mahar  of Rs.50,000/-  and

from the said wedlock petitioner  No.2  was born on 18.10.2005, who remained

with respondent  No.1 till August,  2006.  However, the petitioners  left the abode

of Respondent  No.1 when  he entered into second marriage  and as per claim of

petitioner No.1, respondent No.1  never paid a single penny as maintenance,

which constrained the petitioners  to file a suit for maintenance  w.e.f. 2006 to 2012

along  with maintenance  of minor and Haq Mahar of Rs.50,000f  -, even a ]irga was

constituted to settle the dispute,  however  on 0L.0L.2012, respondent  No.L

extended written divorce to petitioner  No.1

7.  Petitioner No.L appeared as PW-L  and reiterated  her stance through

affidavit  of evidence Exh.P1,  in which it has been brought on record that

respondent  No.1 without obtaining permission  from his first wife entered into

second  marriage  in April, 2006 and never paid a single penny for approximately

07 long years, rather he disappeared from the family life of petitioners and left

petitioner  No.L to take care of petitioner  No.2 at her own resources.  It has further

been stated  by petitioner No.1 that petitioner  No.2 suffers from skin disease,

which requires specialized  treatment,  but respondent  No.1 has not paid any heed

towards  the said treatment of minor.  During  the course of cross-examinatiory

petitioner No.1 acknowledged that she along  with her son are living in her

father's house and the expenses  are being borne  by her father. She has been cross

examined  at length and confronted with the settlement  of issue through  Jirga

referred  as Mark'B,  but she denied the fact that she has received any Haq Mahar

or maintenance  allowance

8.  On the other hand, respondent No.L  appeared  as DW-1 and submitted  his

evidence  as Exh.DL,  in which  he acknowledged  the Haq Mahar  of Rs.50,000/  - as

well as birth  of his son on 18.10.2005  and claimed that he in presence  of witnesses

had pronounced  Talaq-e-Salasa to petitioner  No.1 on 05.02.2006,  whereafter he

entered  into second marriage  having three daughters.  He has also produced

receipt  Exh.D1 and his income  details  vide Exh.D2. During the course  of cross

examinatiorL respondent  No.L acknowledged  that he is working  as Driver with

Coca Cola distribution  company.  Respondent No.L also acknowledged  that he

has neither  produced  any proof of Talaq in the Court,  nor produced  any witness

in this regard.  He acknowledged  document Mark-A of lirga executed on

27.01,.2013,  whereby  he acknowledged  that he executed divorce  in ]anuary,2OL2.

Respondent  No.1 also produced Sardar Abdul  Qudoos  as DW-2 in addition to

his own evidence.

9. 

I  have gone through the receipt  Exh.DL, dated  28.02.2013,  whereby

respondent  No.L has paid amount  of Rs.50,000/-  to petitioner  No.1, while the

recipient name  shows Muhammad Mansha, as suctr,  this document  is not

considered  as receipt of Haq  Mahnr  against petitioner No.L

10.  Perusal of the judgment passed by the learned  Trial Court reveals that

each and every aspect  has been  explained  and a detail view regarding

maintenance  has been  given while deciding  Issue No.L in the following manner:

"Admittedly dcfendant  is working  in a leading  multinational  company;  as
such it is belieoed  that he is getting a salary not less  the minimum  salary
prescribed  by law. He also admits  that he is getting  commission  in
addition  to his salary. Hence at a minimum  side, his salary  is considered
as Rs.20,000-25,000/-  per month. Keeping in  aiew facts  and
circumstances  of the cnse  and taking into consideration  inflation  and other
factors, Rs.4000/-  per month  is fixed as maintenance  of plaintiffNo.2  with
ffict from six years  prior to institution of suit i.e. October  2008 toith L0%

W.P.  No.3498/2017

annual  increase.  First increase  70ill be effectiae  from  01..0L.201.7.
Accordingly  this issue is decided in ffirmatiae."

The above referred  opinion rendered by the learned Trial Court is free from any

illegality and ultimately the learned Trial Court vide impugned  judgment dated

06.03.2017 has rightly  passed the decree in the following manner:

RELIEF
13.  For what has been discussed  abooe, instant suit is decreed in
following terms:-
a. 

Decree for recoaery of maintenance  of plaintiff No.1  @
Rs.2500/- per month w,ef. August 2006 till April201.2.
b.  Decree for recoaery of maintenance  of plaintiff  No.2 @
Rs.4000/-  month  w.e.f. October 2008 till attaining  the age
of majority with  10%  annual  increase. First increase uill
be effecttue  from  01.0L,2017.
Decree for recorsery of dawer amounting to Rs.50,000/-
from defendant.

c. 

1'l-.  I have also gone through the consolidated  judgment  of the learned first

Appellate  Court,  whereby  the findings  of the learned Trial Court have been

maintained.

12.  It is settled law that concurrent findings of the Courts below  could not be

interfered  with in constitutional  jurisdiction,  even otherwise, the question of

jurisdiction raised  by respondent  No.1 has thoroughly  been  explained  by both

the Courts  below in Issue No.2, therefore, no case of interference at this stage  is

made  out, and as such, both the Courts below have not committed any illegality

in passing  of the impugned  judgments  and decrees, however  the conduct of

respondent  No.1 is not above  board who has not paid even a single penny as

maintenance  till date

13.  The petitioners  have successfully  achieved the maintenance  on the basis of

their  evidence  and as such, the record was rightly appreciated  by the Courts

below as the Family Court has given ample  consideration  to the rate of

maintenance  w.e.f. August,  2006 till April,  2012 to the extent of Petitioner  No.L

together with the maintenance  allowance in favour  of Petitioner  No.2 at the rate

W.P.  No.3498/2017

Page  | 6

of Rs.4,000  / - per month  w.e.f.  October,  2008 till 2017 with 10% increase,  however

respondent No.L has not paid the maintenance  allowance.  However, if the

petitioners are aggrieved with the rate of maintenance due to change of

circumstances,  escalation  and devaluation of Pakistan Rupee in these years, the

petitioners can file application for enhancement  of maintenance allowance,

which  could be considered by the concerned  court subject to evidence  and pass

thereon any order in accordance  with law, therefore,  the concurrent findings

derived  by both the Courts below are based upon recognized  principles  of law

1,4. For what has been discussed  above, the instant writ petition is

misconceived  and the same is hereby  DISMISSED.
