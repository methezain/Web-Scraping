Mr.  Moazzam  Habib,  Advocate 
Respondents. 

for 

Petitioner  has filed  instant  petition  assailing 

order  dated  07.05.2019,  whereby,  the  learned 

Judge  Family court,  East-Islamabad  has  fixed  the 

interim  maintenance  of  the  minor/Respondent 

No.3  @  Rs.  20,0001-  per month. 

2. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the  Petitioner, 

inter-alia, 

submitted 

that 

the 

interim 

maintenance  fixed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

court, 

Islamabad 

<East> 

is  exorbitant 

and 

unreasonable; that  the  Petitioner  has  migrated  to 

Canada  and  is  currently  jobless.  Learned counsel 

further 

submitted 

that 

the  quantum  of 

maintenance 

is 

to 

be  determined 

after 

considering  means  and 

financial  position  of 

father,  whereas, impugned  order  has  been passed 

in  a  slipshod manner without  appreciating  the  law 

settled  by  the  superior  courts  on  the  subject. 

Learned  counsel  in  support  of  his  contentions 

placed reliance on the cases  reported  as  Pl.D 2004 

I.HR 849,  2006 Pl.R  1194  (HC I.HR) and  2007 Ml.D 

41 fHC l.HRJ.

Learned counsel for Respondent Nos.2  &  3, 

the  very  beginning  of  his  arguments, 

contended

law  as 

the

interim 

maintenance is  a  temporary arrangement during 

the  pendency of  suit  so  that  the  welfare  and 

needs of the minor be taken care of, whereas, it 

is  now well settled through the pronouncements 

of  superior  courts  of  the  country  that  writ 

petition 

is  not  maintainable  against  interim 

maintenance order passed  under section 17-A  of 

the  west  Pakistan  Family  courts  Act,  1964. 

Learned  counsel to  strengthen  his  arguments 
referred  the  judgments  reported  as  (2019  etc 
1685  IHCJ,  (2018  Cl.C  506  IHCJ,  12017  YI.II 870 

IHCJ,  (2016  Ml.D  742  HC  KHllJ  and  (2016  YI.II 

1869 HC l.HllJ. 

4. 

I  have  heard the  learned counsel for  the 

parties and have also perused the relevant record 

with their able assistance. 

After  going through  the judgments cited 

s. 
by  both  the  learned counsel,  I  am  of  the  view 
that  it  has  now  been a  consistent view of  the 
superior courts that  the writ  petition  against an 

interlocutory order fixing interim maintenance of 

the  minor in  terms of  section 17-A  of  the  west 

is  not 
Pakistan  Family  courts  Act,  1964, 
maintainable as  controversy relating to source of 

income of father and his capacity to  maintain the 

child,  being  a  factual  controversy, cannot  be 

resolved by  the  High  court  while  exercising its 

Writ  Jurisdiction  under  Article  199  of 

the 

constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. 

6. 

In  this  regard  it  is  pertinent  to  refer 

judgment of this court reported as 2020 Cl.C 181, 
wherein section 17-A,  section s  and schedule of 
Family courts  Act, 1964,  with  reference to  Holy 
auran and sunnah has thoroughly been discussed 

3 

W.P.  No.  2212/2019 

and  certain  principles,  to  be  followed  by  Judge 

Family court  while  fixing  interim  maintenance of 

the  minor are laid  down, which are as follows: 

"17.  The  epitome  of  entire  discussion gives a 
complete  insight  that  father  should  not  be 
punished  by  way  of  interim  maintenance 
allowance order  so  that  he would  not  be able 
to  pay  the  maintenance  and  resulted  into 
consequences provided  in section  17-A  of the 
Family  courts  Act,  1964,  therefore,  it  is  the 
imperative  duty  of the  Family court  to  adopt 
a  pragmatic  approach  and  fix  the  interim 
maintenance  on the  following  principles: 

i. 
Financial status  of  father  shall be  kept 
in  view,  which  should  be  based  upon  salary 
slips,  bank  statements,  income  tax  record, 
and  business income  reflected  on  record  or 
through  any other  documentary  proof  placed 
by either  side in the court. 

Interim  maintenance  should  be  fixed 
ii. 
not  on  hard  and  fast  principles,  rather  based 
upon a  tentative  view.

iii.  Maintenance  should  not  be  fixed  on  a

In 

cases,  where 

iv. 
father  has  not 
explained his monthly  income  or  his financial 
status  in  the  pleadings,  rather  concealed  his 
income,  the  Family  court  can  rely  upon  the 
facts  narrated  in  plaint  or  on  the  basis  of 
attached  documents  vis-a-vis  the  needs  of 
minor  and  the  verbal  stance  given  by  father 
without  reference  to  his  written  statement 
will  not  be  considered  justified,  hence  the 
Family  court  shall  exercise  discretion  to  fix 
the  interim  maintenance  while  applying  the 
above principles.

The  needs  of  minor 

vi. 
should  be 
considered on the  basis of social stratification 
of  family  in  which  minor  has  been  brought 
up. 

vii. 
The  financial  status  of father  could  also 
be  considered  on  the  basis of  facts  narrated 
in pleadings of the  parties,  which  includes the 
Jiving  standard  and  previous  matrimonial  life 
of  the  parties  in  which  the  mother/wife  has 
been  provided  with  particular  kind  of  living, 
housing 
gifts, 
immovable  properties  of  husband  and  the 
lifestyle  in  which  husband/father  was  living 
prior  to  separation  or  divorce  or  before  the 
institution  of suit  for maintenance.

In  cases,  where 

viii. 
father  being  civil 
servant  or  employee  of  any  organization, 
department  or  company  has  not  appended 
his salary slips or bank statements,  the  Family 
court  shall ask for an undertaking  or affidavit 
regarding  his  salary  and  thereafter  shall  fix 
the  interim  maintenance,  however  after  the 
trial  of  the  case,  if  the  court  comes  to  the 
conclusion  that  at  the  time  of  fixation  of 
interim 
the 
father/husband  has stated  a  fact  beyond  his 
pleadings  or  undertaking,  which  is  found  to 
be false,  such father  be burdened  with  heavy 
costs  and  action  of  perjury  may  also  be 
initiated  against him.

ix. 
The  Family  court  may  also  call  the 
employer  of  father,  HR  department,  eamtn 
department,  bank  managers,  land  revenue 
department,  tax  record,  and  banking  details 
as  well as  salary details  of the  father  directly 
from  the  relevant  offices  while  deciding  the 
question  of  interim  maintenance  for a  pr/ma 
facie  view  to  fix  the  allowance  in  favour  of 
minor  so  that  no  inadequacy  is  attributed 
while fixing  the  maintenance  allowance. 0â€¢

For  the  reasons  discussed  nerelnabove, 

titled  writ petition  arising from  an  interlocutory 
order  of  learned  Judge  Family  court,  being 

misconceived and not maintainable is accordingly 

dismissed.  However, the  learned trial  court  is
