C.M. No.2456 of 2022. 

Learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

Applicant/Petitioner stated that similar question 

of  law,  as  raised  in  the  instant  petition,  i.e. 

Section  6  of 

the  Muslim  Family  Laws 

Ordinance,  1960  which  pertains  to  Polygamy 

has  also  been  raised  in  W.P.  No.1223/2022 

which  is  pending  before  Bench-VII  of  this 

Court.  It  was  requested  that  since  the  question 

of 

law 

is 

identical, 

therefore,  propriety 

demands 

that  both 

the  petitions  be  heard 

together.

In  view  of  the  submissions  made  by  the 

learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  office  is 

directed to place the file before the Honourable 

Chief  Justice  for  appropriate  orders  in  this 

regard.
