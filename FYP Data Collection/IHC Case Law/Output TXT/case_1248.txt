for 

Through  the 

instant  petition, 

the 

petitioner  being  maternal  grandmother 

seeks handing over the custody of minors to 

her  from  respondents  No.  4  &  5  /  paternal 

grandparents of the minors.  

02.  Succinctly stated facts of the case are 

that, the minors i.e. Arooj Rida / respondent 

No.  6,  (aged  about  05  years  old),  Kamil  / 

respondent No. 7, (aged about 02 years and 

06  months  old)  and  Sahil  /  respondent  No. 

8,  (aged  about  15  months  old),  daughter 

and  sons  of  Shahbaz,  were  residing  with 

their  parents  and  grandparents  in  joint

family  system.  Father  of 

the  minors, 

Shahbaz has allegedly committed murder of 

their  mother  /  his  wife  namely  Aqsa  Bibi, 

whereupon  a  case  vide  FIR  No.  260/2021 

dated  15.05.2021,  offence  under  Section 

302/34  PPC,  police  station  Bhara  Khau, 

Islamabad was registered against Shahbaz / 

father of the minors. He was arrested in the 

case.  Grandfather  of  the  minors  has  also 

been allegedly involved in the murder case, 

who has obtained interim bail before arrest 

from the Court of competent jurisdiction. 

03.  As  the  minors  are  living  with  their 

paternal  grandmother  and  after  the  death 

of  their  mother,  petitioner  being  maternal 

grandmother  is  entitled  for  custody  of  the 

minors,  therefore,  she  has  filed  the  instant 

petition  for  handing  over  their  custody  to 

her.  

04.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter alia  contends  that  the  minors  are  in 

danger  while  in  custody  of  their  paternal 

grandmother; 

the  petitioner  being 

the 

maternal  grandmother 

is  entitled 

for 

custody of the minors under Section 353 of 

 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

Muhammadan  Law;  the  minors  have  been 

improperly  detained  after  brutal  murder  of 

their  mother, 

in 

the  house  of 

their 

grandparents; the grandfather and father of 

the  minors  are  influential  criminals  who 

have brutally killed mother of the minors in 

broad  day  light,  hence  the  petitioner  being 

the  maternal  grandmother  is  entitled  for 

custody of the minors. 

05.  Learned  counsel  for  the  contesting 

respondents  states  that  the  minors  are 

living  with  their  grandparents  since  their 

birth;  there  is  no  allegation  in  the  petition 

that  the  minors  have  been  snatched  from 

the petitioner illegally or unlawfully; there is 

no urgency in the matter and custody of the 

minors  can  only  be  regulated  by  the 

Guardian  Court  under  the  Guardian  and 

Ward Act, 1890.  

06.  Arguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  have  been  heard  and  record  has 

been perused with their able assistance. 

07. 

In 

compliance  of  order  dated 

17.06.2021, passed by this Court, today the 

minors  were  produced 

in 

the  Court 

 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

alongwith 

their  paternal  grandmother. 

There  is  no  allegation  leveled  by  the 

petitioner  in  the  petition  or  during  the 

course  of  arguments  that  the  minors  have 

been  removed  /  snatched  from  custody  of 

the petitioner. It is admitted that right from 

the birth, minors were residing in the house 

where  their  paternal  grandparents  were 

residing  and  still  they  are  residing  in  the 

same  house  under  the  custody  of  their 

grandparents.  

08.  Learned 

counsel  was  asked 

to 

produce  any  single  judgment,  where  the 

minors  were  not  removed  forcibly  from  the 

custody  of  their  maternal  grandmother, 

residing  with  paternal  grandparents  and  by 

orders  of  the  Court  their  custody  was 

handed  over  to  the  maternal  grandmother 

while exercising the discretion under Section 

491  Cr.P.C  or  under  Article  191  of  the 

Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 

whereupon 

learned 

counsel 

for 

the 

petitioner  has  conceded  that  there  is  no 

such judgment or case law available on the 

point.  

 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

09. 

It  has  been  held  by  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a  case  titled 

as  “Mst. Nadia Perveen v. Mst. Almas 

Noreen  and  others” 

(PLD  2012 

Supreme  Court  758) 

that,  “It  has 

consistently been held by this Court in the 

cases of Muhammad Javed Umrao v. Miss 

Uzma  Vahid  (1988  SCNIR  1891),  Nisar 

Muhammad and another v. Sultan Zari (PLD 

1997  SC  852),  Mst.  Khalida  Perveen  v. 

Muhammad Sultan Mehmood and another 

(PLD 2004 SC 1) and Naziha Ghazali v. The 

State and another (2001 SCMR 1782) that 

the matter of custody of minor children can 

be  brought  before  a  High  Court  under 

section 491, Cr.P.C. only if the children are 

of very tender ages they have quite recently 

been snatched away from lawful custody 

and there is a real urgency in the matter 

and also that in such a case the High Court 

may only regulate interim custody of the 

children leaving the matter of final custody 

to be determined by a Guardian Judge. In 

those  cases  this  Court  had  repeatedly 

emphasized  that  in  such  matters  the 

 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

jurisdiction of a High Court under section 

491, Cr.P.C. is to be exercised, sparingly 

and such exercise may be undertaken only 

in exceptional and extraordinary cases of 

real urgency keeping in view that even a 

Guardian Judge has the requisite powers of 

recovery of minor children and regulating 

their  interim  custody”  (Emphasis 

supplied). 

10.  That in a case, where the petition was 

filed  by  the  petitioner  /  mother  of  minor, 

after 5/6 months, alleging unlawful removal 

of  the  minor  from  her  custody,  it  has  been 

held  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of 

Pakistan 

in  a  case  titled  as  “Naziha 

Ghazali  v.  The  State  and  another” 

(2001  SCMR  1782)  that,  “There is no 

explanation as to why the petitioner kept 

quiet for such long period if the minor son 

was removed illegally by the respondent. If 

the minor was removed from her custody 

unlawfully and without her consent, in the 

normal  circumstances,  she  would  have 

either filed report with the police or made a 

complaint  to  the  concerned  authorities 

 
 
7 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

against the respondent in accordance with 

law. 1t would prima facie appear, from the 

said conduct of the petitioner that the minor 

was  not  removed  forcibly  from  the 

apartment by the respondent, therefore, ex 

facie it cannot be said that the custody of 

the minor with his father, the respondent, 

was illegal or unlawful within the meaning 

of section 491, Cr.P.C.” and the decision of 

dismissal  of  petition  by  the  Hon’ble  High 

Court  was  upheld  by  the  Hon’ble  Supreme 

Court of Pakistan. 

11.  Matter  of  custody  of 

the  minor 

children  can  be  brought  before  High  Court 

under  Section  491  Cr.P.C  only  if,  (i)    the 

children  are  of  very  tender  ages,  (ii)  the 

minors  have  quite  recently  been  snatched 

away from lawful custody and (iii) there is a 

real  urgency  in  the  matter,  the  High  Court 

can  only  regulate  interim  custody  of  the 

children  leaving  the  matter  of  final  custody 

to be determined by a Guardian Judge. 

12.  Since  the  petitioner  has  not  been 

deprived of custody of the minors few days 

ago, neither the minors have been snatched 

 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 2081 of 2021 

from the petitioner nor there is any urgency 

involved in the matter.  

13.  Therefore,  keeping  in  view  the  above 

prospect,  instant  writ  petition  has  no  merit 

and  same  is  hereby  dismissed,  however, 

the  petitioner  is  at  liberty  to  invoke  the 

jurisdiction  of  Guardian  Court  for  claiming 

the  custody  of  minors  in  accordance  with 

law.
