01 

24.12.2021  Mr. Aftab Ahmed, advocate.   

Learned  counsel  contends 

that 

the 

impugned 

judgment  dated  24.11.2021 

is  against 

the  mandatory 

provisions  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964,  and  that  neither 

the ex-parte decree for dissolution of marriage was sent to the 

petitioner  nor  its  certified  copy  was  sent  to  the  Chairman 

Union  Council  per  the  mandatory  requirements  of  sections 

9(7)  and  21,  respectively,  of  the  said  Act.    Further  submits 

that  as  the  deceased  (his  wife)  continued  to  reside  with  him 

and  travelled  to  Karachi  with  him  for  treatment  of  her 

ailments  after the decree dated 19.07.2019 for dissolution of 

marriage, it was to be presumed that she had reconciled with 

him, which inference was supported by the fact that she never 

applied  for  the  execution  of  the  decree  until  her  death  on 

30.3.2020.    States  that  both  the  petitioner  and  the  deceased 

were citizens of AJK and, relying on the judgment reported at 

2017 YLR 84, contends that persons not citizens of Pakistan 

whose  marriage  was  solemnized  under  the  law  of  a  territory 

other than Pakistan were not subject to the jurisdiction of the 

Family Courts established for the territory of Pakistan.
