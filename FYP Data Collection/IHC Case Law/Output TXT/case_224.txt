                                  23.12.2022. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

Mr.  Jamil  Hussain  Qureshi,  Mr.  Nawizish  Ali 
and  Mr.Qaiser  Mansoor,  Advocates  for  the 
Petitioner in their respective petitions. 
Mr. Dawood Iqbal, State Counsel. 
Mr.  Muhammad  Mansoor  Abbasi  and  Ch. 
Imtiaz  Ahmed  Gujjar,  Advocates  for  the 
Respondent No.2 in their respective petitions. 

The learned counsel for the Petitioners have 

submitted their arguments including that under the 

preamble  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  read 

with  Section  20  thereof  ,  it  is  the  Family  Court 

that has the powers of a Judicial Magistrate to try 

any  offence  under  the  Muslim  Family  Law 

Ordinance,  1961.  He 

further  submits 

that 

Executive Magistrate has no power in such regard 

in  view  of  the  provisions  of  the  Family  Courts 

Act,  1964  as  aforesaid.  Furthermore,  Executive 

Magistrate 

is  not 

legally 

trained  and  even 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
otherwise exercising of powers by him in respect 

of  family  matter 

is  unconstitutional  and 

in 

violation  of  concept  of  separation  of  Executive 

and Judiciary. 

2. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  learned  State 

Counsel  relies  upon  Section  5  of  the  Family 

Courts Act, 1964, which provides that under Sub- 

-2- 

Section  2  a  Family  Court  shall  only  exercise  its 

powers in respect of the offences under Part-II of 

Schedule, whereas the Schedule does not include 

any  offence  under  the  Muslim  Family  Laws 

Ordinance,  1961  and  is  restricted  to  certain 

offences  under  PPC.  He  further  explained  that 

Section  20  of  the  Family  Courts  Act,  1964 

provides  powers  of 

the  Judicial  Magistrate, 

whereas  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  has  been 

amended  in  Punjab  to  explicitly  include  offences 

under 

the  Muslim  Family  Ordinance,  1961, 

however,  no  such  amendment  has  been  made  to 

the relevant law as applicable in ICT. He therefore 

argued  that  to  the  extent  of  ICT  there  is  no 

provision  in  law,  which  can  be  relied  upon  by  a 

Family  Court  to  take  cognizance  of  the  offences 

 
 
 
mentioned 

in 

the  Muslim  Family  Laws 

Ordinance,  1961. 

In  order 

to  support  his 

submission,  he  has  also  highlighted  the  fact  that 

the Muslim Family Law was promulgated in 1961 

despite  the  fact  that  at  such  time  the  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964  was  not  in  existence  and 

therefore,  prior  to  the  promulgation  of  the  latter 

Act,  it  was  Executive  Magistrates,  who  were 

trying  such  offences,  however,  he  seeks  further 

time to assist the Court with regard to the powers 

of  Executive  Magistrate  and  the  relevant  law 

under which they are appointed.  

3. 

To come up for further arguments by State 

Counsel  as  well  as  counsel  for  the  Respondent  

-3- 

No.2  in  both  the  petitions  and  rebuttal  for  the 

Petitionersâ€™ counsel. 

4. 

Relist  on  25.01.2023.  The  matter  shall  be 

taken up 10:00 a.m.
