MIANGUL  HASSAN  AURANGZEB,  J:-  Through 

this 

consolidated  judgment,  I  propose  to  dispose  of  Writ  Petition 

No.532/2016 and Writ Petition No.591/2016 as common questions 

of law and fact are involved in these petitions.  

2.  W.P.No.532/2016 has been filed against the judgment dated 

07.01.2016, passed by the Court of the learned Additional District 

Judge-West,  Islamabad,  whereby  the  petitioner's  appeal  against 

the  Order  dated  07.07.2015,  passed  by  the  court  of  the  learned 

Rent  Controller,  Islamabad,  was  dismissed.  Vide  the  said  Order 

dated 07.07.2015, respondents No.1 to 3's eviction petition under 

Section  17  of  the  Islamabad  Rent  Restriction  Ordinance,  2001 

("IRRO"),  was  allowed,  and  the  petitioner  was  directed  to 

handover  vacant  possession  of  the  rented  premises  within  a 

period of one month.  

3.  W.P.No.591/2016 has been filed against the judgment dated 

07.01.2016, passed by the Court of the learned Additional District 

Judge-West,  Islamabad,  whereby  the  petitioner's  appeal  against 

the  Order  dated  07.07.2015,  passed  by  the 

learned  Rent 

Controller,  Islamabad,  was  dismissed.  Vide  the  said  Order  dated 

07.07.2015,  respondent  No.1's  eviction  petition  under  Section  17 

of  the  IRRO,  was  allowed,  and  the  petitioner  was  directed  to 

handover  vacant  possession  of  the  rented  premises  within  a 

period of one month.  

4. 

The  facts  essential  for  the  disposal  of  these  petitions  are 

that  on  22.05.2007,  respondents  No.1  to  3  in  W.P.No.532/2016, 

filed an eviction petition under Section 17 of the IRRO seeking the 

eviction  of  the  petitioner  from  Shop-cum-Flat/Unit  No.2,  Gole 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
2 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

Market,  Sector  F-7/3,  Islamabad  ("Unit  No.2").  On  the  same  day 

(i.e.  22.05.2007),  respondent  No.1  in  W.P.No.591/2016,  filed  an 

eviction petition under Section 17 of the IRRO seeking the eviction 

of  the  petitioner  from  Unit  No.1,  Gol  Market,  Sector  F-7/3, 

Islamabad  ("Unit  No.1").  Unit  No.1  and  Unit  No.2  ("the  rented 

premises") are adjacent to each other and were rented out by the 

petitioner  on  11.10.2003  from  their  respective  owners.  The 

eviction petitions instituted by the owners of the rented premises 

are  more  or  less  identical  in  their  essential  particulars  save  the 

description  of the  rented  premises  and  the names  of the eviction 

petitioners.  The  grounds  on  which  these  eviction  petitions  were 

filed  were  (1)  expiry  of  the  lease  agreement,  (2)  the  landlord's 

personal  bonafide  need  so  as  to  establish  a  bakery  to  be  run  by 

the  landlord's  children,  (3)  default  in  the  payment  of  rent  since 

01.11.2006,  and  default  in  the  payment  of  utility  bills,  and  (4)  the 

conversion  of  the  external  open  space/verandah  into  a  dinning 

hall 

in  violation  of  the 

Islamabad  Zoning  Control  Building 

Regulation,  1993,  and  removal  of  common  walls  between  the 

rented premises.  

5. 

The petitioner contested these eviction petitions by filing his 

written  replies.  On  16.12.2008,  the  learned  Rent  Controller 

passed  a  tentative  rent  order  under  Section  17(8)  of  the  IRRO 

directing the petitioner to deposit arrears of rent from November, 

2006 till December, 2008 at the rate of Rs.44,748/- per month with 

a  10  %  increase  per  annum.  Furthermore,  the  petitioner  was 

directed to deposit future rent at the rate of Rs.59,559/- per month 

on  or  before  the  15th  of  each  month.  Subsequently,  vide  order 

dated  17.04.2009,  the  said  order  dated  16.12.2008  was  modified 

with the consent of the parties and the petitioner was directed to 

pay future rent at the rate of Rs.54,145/- instead of Rs.59,559/- per 

month. On 18.05.2013, the respondents filed an application under 

Section  17(9)  of  the  IRRO  praying  for  an  eviction  order  on  the 

ground  that  the  petitioner  had  not  deposited  the  tentative  rent 

with  a  10%  statutory  increase  since  October,  2009.  The  learned 

Rent  Controller,  vide  order  dated  07.06.2013,  dismissed  the 

respondents'  said  application  under  Section  17(9)  of  the  IRRO. 

The  said  order  dated  07.06.2013  was  assailed  by  the  petitioner 

 
3 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

before the Hon'ble Islamabad High Court in W.P.Nos.2655 & 2997 

of  2013,  which  were  allowed,  vide  orders  dated  18.06.2014,  the 

operative part whereof is reproduced herein below:-  

“11. There is no exception to the consequences of non-deposit, 
non-compliance of order of Rent Controller having been given in 
Sub Section 9 of Section 17 of IRRO, 2001. On the contrary, in 
addition to such rigidity the mandatory provision not only depicts 
striking  off  the  defence,  but  also  keeping  the  landlord  in 
possession of the building without any further proceedings. 
12. In view of above discussion, I am of the confirm view that the 
tenant  has  committed willful default in payment  of statutory 
increase rent since October, 2009, therefore, order passed by the 
learned Trial Court is liable to be set aside, same is therefore, set 
aside. Respondent is directed to deliver the vacant possession of 
Unit No.1 (Shop-cum-flat) in question to the petitioner on or before 
31.7.2014. In case, he fails to do so, the petitioner will be at liberty 
to execute the ejectment order in accordance with law.”  

6. 

The  said  orders  dated  18.06.2014  were  challenged  by  the 

petitioner  before  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  Civil  Petitions 

No.1372  and  1373/2014.  Vide  Order  dated  01.09.2014,  the  said 

petitions  were  converted  into  appeals  and  allowed  by  setting 

aside  the  order  dated  18.06.2014,  passed  by  the  Hon'ble  High 

Court.  The  matters  were  remanded  to  the  Court  of  the  learned 

Rent  Controller  with  the  direction  to  complete  the  proceedings 

within  a  period  of  two  months.  The  operative  part  of  the  Order 

dated  01.09.2014,  passed  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  is 

reproduced herein below:-  

“4. …..Order of the Rent Controller dated 16.12.2008 can be split 
into two parts; one relating to the deposit of future rent and the 
other is 10% increase restricted to the arrears. The future rent 
for each of the property at the rate of 59559/- per month was 
ordered to be deposited on or before 15th of each month. The 
10% increase per annum was not mentioned regarding future 
rent. This is the plain reading of the said order. No other 
construction can be placed upon it. This order was passed way 
back in 2008 and no effort was made by the respondents for its 
modification.  
5.  The High Court had referred to the rent deed to conclude 
that the petitioner was obliged to pay the future rent at the 
increased rate of 10%. For the purpose of interpretation of the 
order of the Rent Controller the provisions of lease agreements 
cannot  be  invoked.  Sub-  Section  (9)  of  Section  17  of  the 
Ordinance of 2001 is a special provision whereby the Rent 
Controller strikes down the defence of the tenants in case he 
fails to deposit the rent as ordered. Thus, only the order of the 
Rent Controller is to be looked into to determine whether the 
provisions of Sub-Section (9) of Section 17 of the Ordinance of 
2001 can be invoked. Thus, the High Court had erred in law in 
allowing the Writ Petitions filed by the respondents landlords. 
The petitions were therefore converted into appeals and allowed 
by our short order, which reads: 

 
 
4 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

"For reasons to be recorded later, these petitions are 
converted  into  appeals  and  allowed.  The  impugned 
judgments are set aside. Since the ejectment petition was 
filed by the respondents way back in the year 2007 and 
evidence has yet to be concluded, the Rent Controller shall 
complete the proceedings within a period of two months 
and intimate the Registrar of this Court."  

7. 

After  the  remand  of  the  matter  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court,  the  learned  Rent  Controller  recorded  the  evidence  of  the 

parties’  witnesses.  In  both  the  cases,  the  petitioner  produced 

himself  as  RW-1,  and  Chaudhry  Muhammad  Ramzan  entered  the 

witness  box  as  AW-1.  Vide  Orders  dated  07.07.2015,  the  learned 

Rent  Controller  allowed  the  eviction  petitions  and  directed  the 

petitioner to hand over vacant possession of the rented premises 

to the landlords within a period of one month. These orders were 

assailed  by  the  petitioner  in  appeals  before  the  Court  of  the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad.  Vide  orders  dated, 

07.01.2016,  the  learned  appellate  Court  dismissed  the  said 

appeals.  

SUBMISSIONS  OF  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE 
PETITIONER/LANDLORD:  

8. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  in  W.P.No.532/2016 

submitted  that the  title page  of  the eviction  petition  shows  that it 

was instituted by three petitioners, whereas the said petition was 

signed  by  only  one  eviction  petitioner,  namely,  Muhammad  Ishaq 

(respondent  No.1),  who  claims  to  be  the  special  attorney  of  the 

other two eviction petitioners, namely, Mrs. Sakina Jamil and Mrs. 

Zarina  Ramzan  (respondents  No.2  &  3).  The  body  of  the  eviction 

petition  does  not  disclose  as  to  why  respondents  No.2  &  3  have 

not signed the eviction petition. It is next contended that the lease 

agreement dated 11.10.2003 with respect to Unit No.2 was signed 

by respondents No.2 & 3 as landlords. Unit No.2 is admittedly  an 

un-partitioned  property  co-owned  by  respondents  No.1  to  3.  No 

wakalatnama  was  filed  before  the  learned  Rent  Controller  on 

behalf  of  respondents  No.2 &  3,  and,  therefore,  they  engaged  no 

counsel  for  their  representation.  Respondents  No.2  &  3  never 

entered  the  witness  box  to  verify  the  contents  of  the  eviction 

petition. The legal effect of all these omissions was that there was 

no  eviction  petition  on  behalf  of  respondents  No.2  &  3  and  they 

 
 
 
 
5 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

never  sought  the  petitioner's  eviction  from  Unit  No.2.  He  further 

submitted  that  in  the  eviction  petition,  the  portion  of  Unit  No.2 

owned by respondents No.2 & 3 should have been separated. He 

contended  that  the  learned  Rent  Controller  erred  in  law  by 

allowing  the  eviction  petition  for  the  whole  of  the  property.  As 

regards  respondent  No.1,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

submitted  that  he  never  entered  the  witness  box  and  that 

respondent 

No.1's 

attorney 

(Chaudhry 

Muhammad 

Ramzan/A.W.1)  had  submitted  an  affidavit-in-evidence  (Exh.A-1). 

A.W.1 was not the attorney of respondents No.2 & 3. 

9. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  further  submitted  that 

one  of  the  grounds  taken  by  the  respondents  in  the  eviction 

petition  was  the  expiry  of  the  lease  agreement,  but  the  learned 

Rent  Controller  has  held  that  the  lease  agreement  had  not 

expired. According to the  3rd paragraph of the lease  agreement, 

the same is valid up to 2020. The plea taken by the respondents in 

the  eviction  petition  was  that  the  lease  expired  in  October  2006. 

The  respondents  had  deposed  on  oath  that  the  rent  agreement 

was valid until October 2006. The long validity period of the lease 

agreement,  and  the  power  of  the  petitioner  to  sublet  the  rented 

premises  is  the  main  reason,  while  the  respondents  denied  the 

execution of the lease agreement. The learned Rent Controller did 

not  believe  the  contention  of  the  respondents  that  the  lease 

agreement  had  expired,  but  he  believed 

their  contention 

regarding the allegation of default.  

10. 

It  was  further  submitted  that  in  the  eviction  petition,  the 

respondents admitted their signatures on the lease agreement but 

asserted that they were obtained by fraud. On the contrary, in the 

evidence,  the  respondents  deposed  that  the  signatures  on  the 

lease  agreement  are  someone  else's.  Since  Unit  No.2  is  a 

commercial  property,  therefore,  the  plea  of  personal  bonafide 

need was not available to the respondents.  

11.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the 

eviction  petition  was  granted  by  the  learned  Rent  Controller 

primarily  on  the  ground  of  default  in  the  payment  of  rent,  and 

unauthorized  structural  changes.  The  respondents  had  alleged 

that  the  petitioner  defaulted 

in  the  payment  of  rent  since 

 
6 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

November,  2006.  In  Paragraph  4.1  of  the  eviction  petition,  it  is 

pleaded/alleged that the default in the payment of rent on the part 

of  the  petitioner  started  from  the  month,  when,  according  to  the 

respondents,  the  lease  agreement  expired.  Before  November, 

2006 there is no allegation of any default in the payment of rent. In 

fact since October 2006, the respondents refused to receive rent 

from the petitioner. The respondents' motive behind not receiving 

the  rent  was  to  engineer  a  default  and  attribute  the  same  to  the 

petitioner.  As  the  respondents  refused  to  receive  the  rent  from 

the petitioner, the petitioner tendered it through Pay Order dated 

31.05.2007 for the months of December 2006 to August 2007, and 

a  postal  receipt  in  this  regard  was  also  placed  on  record.  The 

mode of payment of rent was provided in the rent agreement. Until 

May  2007,  there  were  two  terms  of  three  months  each  for  which 

advance  rent  had  to  be  paid  -  the  first  term  was  from  November 

2006  to  January  2007,  and  the  second  term  was  from  February 

2007 to April 2007. The rent for this period was tendered through 

the above  mentioned  Pay  Order in  May  2007.  The  alleged  default 

on  the  part  of  the  petitioner  was  of  two  terms  (of  three  months 

each)  and  not  that  of  six  months.  The  alleged  default  is  for  the 

period during which the respondents allege that there was no rent 

agreement.  Notionally  speaking,  there  was  no  rent  agreement 

until  the  learned  Rent  Controller  ruled  that  there  existed  an 

agreement  between  the  parties.  Where  there  was  no  rent 

agreement, the statute would govern and regulate the relationship 

between  the  landlord  and  tenant.  Under  Section  17(2)(i)  of  the 

IRRO, a landlord can seek the eviction of a tenant if the tenant has 

not  paid  or  "tendered"  the  rent  due  from  him.  As  the  petitioner 

had  "tendered"  the  rent  for  the  two,  three-month  terms  through 

pay  order  dated  31.05.2007  Exh.R.23,  an  eviction  petition  could 

not  have  been  filed  against  the  petitioner.  The  learned  Rent 

Controller  misread  the  evidence  by  holding  that  there  was  no 

evidence  as  to  the  refusal  to  receive  rent.  The  petitioner  was 

cross-examined  on  this  matter;  that  the  learned  Rent  Controller 

should  have  given  reasons  for  not  believing  this  aspect  of  the 

petitioner's  evidence,  therefore,  the  order  of  the  learned  Rent 

 
7 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

Controller  was  not  the  result  of  appropriate  adjudication  of  the 

said matter. 

12.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  upon  the 

expiry  of  the  rent  agreement,  the  statutory  provisions  take  the 

place  of  the  rent  agreement;  that  when  there 

is  no  rent 

agreement, the statutory provisions would govern the relationship 

between  the  landlord  and  the  tenant;  that  although,  the  default 

was alleged to be under the rent agreement, but the respondents 

were denying the rent agreement; that the learned Rent Controller 

relied  upon  the  terms  of  the  rent  agreement  and  held  the 

petitioner  to  be  a  defaulter  by  holding  that  the  petitioner  had  to 

pay rent  in advance for three months; that  the respondents were 

asserting  default,  and  at  the  same  time  denying  the  rent 

agreement;  that  the  allegation  of  default  should  have  been 

decided  in  accordance  with  statutory  provisions;  that  under  the 

law, a default has to be a willful default - a default for which there 

is  no  explanation;  that  under  the  rent  laws,  default  is  an  act 

resulting in penal consequences; that where a subject  was being 

tried  for  imposition  of  penal  consequences,  the  circumstances 

should be thrashed out prejudicially and all inferences have to be 

drawn in favour of the subject; that prior to November 2006, there 

was  no  allegation  of  default  made  by  the  respondents;  that  the 

default is for a very small period - a default of two terms only; that 

the  bank  certificates  confirm  the  issuance  and  diary  of  the  pay 

orders;  that  the  said  default  on  the  part  of  the  petitioner  is 

admitted  but  it  should  have  been  considered  in  the  attending 

circumstances;  and  that  had  the  attending  circumstances  been 

taken  into  account,  the  learned  Rent  Controller  would  have 

certainly held that it was an engineered default. 

13.  The  eviction  petition  was  filed  by  the  respondents  on 

22.05.2007. When this eviction petition was filed, there had been a 

default  of  two  terms  of  three  months  each.  The  petitioner  admits 

that  he  should  have  gone  to  the  learned  Rent  Controller  and 

applied for permission to deposit the rent. However, the petitioner 

kept on sending pay orders until the order dated  16.12.2008 was 

passed  under  Section  17(8)  of  the  IRRO.  When  this  order  was 

passed, there were no arrears in rent. Nonetheless an application 

 
8 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

was filed by the respondents under Section 17(9) of the IRRO. This 

application  was  turned  down  by  the  learned  Rent  Controller. 

However,  the  respondents'  second  application  under  Section 

17(9)  of  the  IRRO  was  granted.  This  application  was  granted  by 

holding that there was a delay  of one day in the payment of rent. 

The petitioner went in appeal and the appellate court reversed the 

order  passed  by  the  learned  Rent  Controller  under  Section  17(9) 

of  the  IRRO.  The  grounds  taken  by  the  respondents  in  their 

application under Section 17(9) of the IRRO was that the petitioner 

was  not  depositing  the  increased  rent  in  terms  of  the  rent 

agreement  -  a  rent  agreement  which  the  respondents  were 

denying.   The  said  appellate  order  was  challenged  in  the  writ 

jurisdiction  of  the  Hon'ble  Islamabad  High  Court.  The  writ 

petitions were allowed by the Hon'ble High Court holding the non-

payment  of  an  increased  rent  to  be  a  default.  The  petitioner 

impugned  the  judgment  of  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  before  the 

Hon'ble Supreme Court, which reversed the orders passed by the 

Hon'ble High Court and remanded the matter to the learned Rent 

Controller,  holding  that  there  was  no  order  to  deposit  any 

increased rent. Since December 2008 till date, there has been no 

default  in  the  deposit  of  rent.  Therefore,  the  respondents  are 

estopped to raise any plea of default from May 2007 till date.  

14. 

In  the  order  dated  16.12.2008,  passed  by  the  learned  Rent 

Controller,  there  was  a  direction  to  deposit  rent  from  November 

2006 to December 2008. The petitioner had taken the position that 

as the rent due had been tendered through pay orders, there was 

no  reason  to  deposit  the  arrears  in  the  Court.  However,  the  rent 

for  the  said  two  terms  was  deposited  in  the  Court.  The  appellate 

court  had  also  held  that  there  had  been  no  default.  The  learned 

counsel for the petitioner did not place reliance on any case law in 

support of his submissions. 

15.  That as  regards  the ground  of structural changes  on which 

the  respondents  sought  the  eviction  of  the  petitioner  from  the 

rented premises, the same was denied by the petitioner; and that 

a  restaurant  had  admittedly  been  established  at  the  rented 

premises.

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

SUBMISSIONS  MADE  BY  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR  THE 
LANDLORDS / PRIVATE RESPONDENTS: 

16.  Mr. Khurram M. Qureshi, Advocate for the landlords / private 

respondents  read  over  the  four  grounds  on  which  the  eviction 

petition was filed. On 22.05.2007, the eviction petition was filed by 

the landlords under Section 17 of the IRRO. As the petitioner was 

avoiding  notices  from  the  Court,  a  proclamation  was  issued.  As 

late  as  16.06.2008,  the  petitioner  put  in  appearance.  This  was 

after  ex-parte  proceedings  against  the  petitioner  had  been 

initiated  on  06.08.2007,  and  the  matter  had  been  fixed  for 

recording of ex-parte evidence. With the consent of the contesting 

parties, the order to proceed with the case ex-parte was recalled.  

17.  Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents  submitted  that  there 

were four categories of default in the payment of rent  \committed 

by  the  petitioner.  These  categories  have  been  listed  herein 

below:-  

(i) 

(ii) 

Rent  for  the  month  of  November,  2006  has  not  been  paid 
at any stage; 
lease  agreement  required  the  petitioner  to  pay 
The 
advance  rent  on  quarterly  basis.  It  is  an  admitted  position 
that  advance  rent  on  quarterly  basis  after  October  2006 
was not paid by the petitioner; 

(iii)  Since  February  2009  the  rent  was  being  deposited  by  the 
petitioner  at  a  fixed  rate  with  no  increase.  In  other  words, 
since the past seven years, there had been  no increase in 
the rent deposited by the petitioner in the Court. The lease 
agreement  provided  for  a  yearly  increase  in  rent  by  10% 
and;  

(iv)   For  the  months of December  2006 and  February 2009, the 
petitioner claims to have paid the rent through pay orders, 
whereas  there  is  no  evidence  of  any  tender,  receipt  and 
encashment of any pay order.  

18. 

It is admitted that until October 2006, rent had been paid by 

the petitioner. The dispute regarding the default in the payment of 

rent  arose 

from  November  2006  onwards.  During  cross-

examination of the petitioner, he admitted that there was no proof 

for the payment of rent for the month of November 2006. The mere 

fact that rent for the month of November 2006 has not been paid, 

renders  the  petitioner  liable  to  eviction.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents  submitted  that  the  petitioner  had  committed  default 

in the payment of rent from November 2006 to February 2009, and 

that  the  petitioner  had  committed  default  by  not  paying  advance 

quarterly  rent.  Since  February  2009,  the  petitioner  was  paying  a

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

fixed  amount  as  rent,  with  no  increase.  For  Unit  No.01,  the 

petitioner  was  paying  Rs.32,152/-  per  month,  whereas  for  Unit 

No.02,  he  was  paying  Rs.54,145/-  per  month.  As  regards  the 

period  from  December,  2006  to  February  2009,  the  petitioner  in 

his  cross-examination  had  deposed  that  rent  for  the  said  period 

had  been  paid  through  pay  orders  which  had  been  sent  through 

courier. The petitioner has not been able to prove the six or seven 

pay  orders  or  that  they  have been en-cashed.  Under the  law,  the 

delivery  of  the  pay  orders  to  the  landlord  was  mandatory.  In  the 

written reply filed by the petitioner, there is no plea regarding the 

tendering  of  rent  through  pay  orders.  When  the  parties  were  at 

variance  on  the  question  whether  payments  were  made  through 

pay orders, the burden was on the petitioner to prove this fact. He 

placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of  Liberty  Paper  Ltd.  VS  Mrs. 

Ghazala (2004 YLR 1784) and Roshan Habib VS Haji Usman (1987 

CLC  1484)  and  contended  that  the  delivery  of  a  cheque  or  a  pay 

order was mandatory. The petitioner in his cross-examination has 

admitted that the pay order was for the period between December 

2006 to August 2007 (i.e. for a period of nine months). The date of 

this  pay  order 

is  31.05.2007  and 

it 

is  for  an  amount  of 

Rs.6,42,510/-.  Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents  submitted 

that  the  mere  fact  that  the  rent  for  December  2006  to  August, 

2007  was  claimed  to  have  been  paid  by  the  petitioner  on 

31.05.2007, is a default ipso facto on the part of the petitioner.  

19.  He  further  submitted  that  an  order  under  Section  17(8)  of 

the IRRO is only a tentative order and is subject to evidence. The 

lease agreement had provided for yearly increase of rent by 10%. 

Under  Section  10  of  the  IRRO,  rent  has  to  be  enhanced  by  25% 

after every three years. In both the situations, the petitioner was a 

defaulter.  A  specific  order  directing  the  petitioner  to  pay  an 

increased rent was not required.  

20.  Learned counsel for the respondents submitted that Section 

5 of the IRRO required the lease agreement to be registered. The 

lease  agreement  between  the  parties  was  also  compulsorily 

registerable  under  Section  17  of  the  Registration  Act,  1908.  The 

consequences  of  non-registration  of  a  compulsorily  registerable 

document  are  provided  in  Section  49  of  the  Registration  Act, 

 
11 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

1908.  As  the  lease  agreements  between  the  contesting  parties 

were not registered, by operation of law they had a validity period 

of eleven months  only. The  learned counsel in this  regard placed 

reliance  on  the  cases  of  HBL  VS  Munawar  Ali  Siddiqui  (1991 

SCMR  1185),  M.K.  Muhammad  V.  Muhammad  Abu  Bakar  (1993 

SCMR  200),  Abdul  Shakoor  VS  Azeem  Yousaf  (2013  YLR  1004). 

Therefore,  the  respondents  were  correct  in  pleading  that  the 

lease agreements had expired.  

21. 

It  was  further  submitted  that any  one of the  co-owners  was 

competent to file an eviction petition without impleading the other 

co-owners.  In  this  regard,  he  placed  reliance  on  the  cases  of 

Maqsood Ahmad VS Khalid Hussain Khan (2002 SCMR 1112), Dr. 

Masuma  Hasan  VS  Muhammad  Hafeez  (2015  MLD  1577),  and 

Muhammad  Anwar  VS  Mir  Rafique Ahmed  Talpur  (2014  MLD  23). 

He stressed that under the provisions of IRRO, any person entitled 

to receive rent came within the definition of a landlord. Therefore, 

the eviction petitions were competently filed. 

22.  Learned  counsel  for  the  respondents/landlords  drew  the 

Court's attention to Exh.A.3, which is a special power of attorney 

executed  by  Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq  (respondent  No.1  in  writ 

petition  No.532/2016)  and  Mrs.  Zarina  Ramzan  (respondent  No.3 

in  W.P.No.532/2016)  in  favour  of  Ch.  Muhammad  Ramzan  Tahir 

A.W.1  and  respondent  No.1 

in  writ  petition  No.591/2016), 

authorizing  the  latter  to  be  their  special  attorney  in  the  eviction 

petition  titled  "Ch.  Ishaq  and  others  VS  Ahmad  Nadeem"  before 

the 

learned  Rent  Controller.  The  said  attorney  has  been 

specifically authorized to appear in the Court on behalf of the said 

principals  and  make  statements,  give  evidence,  sign  on 

documents,  initiate  proceedings,  etc.  Similarly,  through  Exh.A.2, 

Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq  has  appointed  Ch.  Muhammad  Ramzan 

Tahir as a Special Attorney in respect of the eviction petition titled 

"Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq  VS  Ahmad  Nadeem  Abbasi"  before  the 

learned Rent Controller.  

23.  Mrs.  Zarina  Ramzan  (respondent  No.3  in  W.P.No.532/2013) 

is  Ch.  Muhammad  Ramzan's  wife.  Unit  No.01  is  wholly  owned  by 

Ch. Muhammad Ramzan. In Unit No.02, 75% shares are owned by 

 
12 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

Mrs. Zarina Ramzan, whereas 25% shares are owned by the legal 

heirs of Ch. Muhammad Ishaq's wife, Mrs. Zainab Bibi (deceased). 

24.  As  mentioned  above,  Ch.  Muhammad  Ramzan  Tahir 

(respondent  No.1  in  W.P.No.591/2016)  was  the  owner  of  Unit 

No.01  and  also  the  eviction  petitioner  before  the  learned  Rent 

Controller.  He  submitted  his  affidavit  in  evidence.  He  is  the  real 

brother  of  Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq,  who  is  one  of  the  co-owners  of 

Unit No.02 and also the eviction petitioner. 

25.  The lease agreement with respect to Unit No.02 was signed 

by  Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq  on  behalf  of  all  the  co-owners.  He  was 

under no legal impediment to sign the lease agreement in terms of 

Section  2(g)  of  the 

IRRO,  which  defines  a  "landlord". 

In 

conclusion, he prayed for the writ petitions to be dismissed.  

26.  Learned  counsel  further  submitted  that  the  learned  courts 

below  have  erred  in  law  by  deciding  the  ground  of  personal 

bonafide  need  against  the  respondents.  He  contended  that  in 

these proceedings, he can also question that part of the impugned 

order,  which  was  against  the  respondents.  In  this  regard,  he 

placed  reliance  on  the  case  of  Muhammad  Ayub  Khan  VS  Abdul 

Aziz  Burney  (1994  CLC  1123).  He  submitted  that  the  rented 

premises  were  required  for  the  respondents'  children  namely, 

Muhammad  Faizan  (aged  30)  and  Ehsan  (aged  28),  who  were  old 

enough to run their business at the rented premises.  

27.  On the question of  making  structural changes  in  the rented 

premises, A.W.1 was not cross-examined. His testimony about the 

conversion  of  the  verandah  into  the  dinning  hall  had  gone  un-

rebutted. 

SUBMISSIONS  IN  REJOINDER  BY  THE  LEARNED  COUNSEL  FOR 
THE PETITIONER: 

28. 

In  his  rejoinder,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

submitted  that  it  is  not  disputed  that  any  co-owner  of  the  rented 

premises  could  file  the  eviction  petition.  However,  he  submitted 

that  two  of  the  eviction  petitioners  had  not  signed  the  eviction 

petition  and  had  also  not  authorized  any  body  else  to  sign  the 

eviction  petition.  The  powers  of  attorney  (Exh.A.2  and  Exh.A.3) 

were in favour of Ch. Muhammad Ramzan Tahir and not in favour 

of  Ch.  Muhammad  Ishaq,  who  had  signed  one  of  the  eviction 

 
  
 
 
13 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

petitions. In such a situation, the learned Rent Controller had two 

options before him viz (i) either to delete or strike off the names of 

the  eviction  petitioners,  who  had  not  signed  the  petition,  or  (ii) 

reject the eviction petition to their extent. By not exercising either 

of these options, the learned Rent Controller granted the petition 

in  favour  of  landlords,  who  had  not  signed  the  eviction  petitions. 

Additionally,  it  was  submitted  that  the  eviction  petition  did  not 

disclose as to who and in what proportion the rented premises is 

owned  by.  Consequently,  the  presumption  would  be  that  all  the 

co-owners  owned  the  rented  premises  in  equal  proportion.  As 

regards  Unit  No.01,  the  other  co-owners  did  not 

join  Ch. 

Muhammad  Ishaq  in  filing  the  eviction  petition.  This,  the  learned 

counsel  submitted,  was  a  legal  question  that  should  have  been 

answered by the learned Rent Controller.  

29.  The learned counsel for the petitioner drew the attention of 

the  Court  to  Section  24  of  the  IRRO  and  submitted  that  no  order 

could be passed by the learned Rent Controller without holding an 

inquiry  and  affording  an  opportunity  of  hearing.  The  eviction 

petitioner  was  supposed  to  stand  on  his  own  legs  by  proving  his 

own  case,  after  which  the  onus  shifts  on  to  the  other  side.  He 

submitted  that  the  petitioner  had  carried  out  no  structural 

changes  and  that  the  restaurant  is  still  in  the  same  shape.  The 

respondents  had  not  discharged  the  onus  of  proving  that 

structural  changes  have  been  made  by  the  petitioner.  He  further 

submitted that as the provisions of Transfer of Property Act, 1882, 

were not applicable to the Islamabad Capital Territory, hence, the 

objection  of  the  respondents  as  to  the  non-registration  of  the 

lease agreements pails into in significance.   

30.  The petitioner had paid the rent for the first year in advance. 

Thereafter,  the  rent was  paid  on quarterly/three monthly  basis  in 

advance. Default in the payment of rent for the month of October 

2006  had  not  been  alleged  by  the  respondents.  Rent  for  the 

months  of  October,  November  and  December,  2006,  was  due  on 

01.10.2006.  There  is  no  allegation  of  any  default  in  payment  of 

rent for  the month  of October 2006.  Default  had  been  alleged  for 

the month of November 2006 and not October 2006. The petitioner 

was  entitled  to  the  statutory  grace  period  of  sixty  days  for  the 

 
14 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

payment  of  rent  under  Section  17(2)(i)  of  the  IRRO.  As  the 

respondents  had  denied  the  lease  agreement,  the  mode  of 

payment  would  not  be  in  advance  but  in  accordance  with  the 

provisions  of  the  IRRO.  The  learned  Rent  Controller  did  not 

conduct  an  inquiry  as  contemplated  by  the  provisions  of  IRRO  to 

see  if  any  willful  default  had  been  committed  by  the  petitioner. 

Default  on  the  part  of  the  petitioner  could  either  have  been  on 

01.10.2006  or  01.01.2007.  Accordingly,  it  would  not  be  until 

31.03.2007  when  the  rent  would  be  next  due.  The  rent  due  on 

31.03.2007 could  have  been  paid  by  the  petitioner  on  30.05.2007 

(i.e.  within  the  statutory  grace  period).  The  learned  counsel  for 

the  petitioner  prayed  for  the  writ  petitions  to  be  allowed  and  the 

concurrent orders passed by the Courts below to be set aside.   

31. 

I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  at  great 

length,  stretched  over  a  number  of  days,  and  perused  the 

voluminous record with their able assistance. The facts have been 

set  out  with  sufficient  detail  in  paragraphs  04    to  06  above,  and 

need not be recapitulated.  

32.  The 

lease  agreement  with  respect  to  Unit  No.2  was 

executed  on  10.10.2003,  between  the  petitioner,  as  lessee,  and 

Chaudhry  Muhammad  Ishaq  for  himself  and  as  the  general 

attorney  of  (1)  Mrs.  Sakina  Jamil,  (2)    Mrs.  Zainab,  and  (3)  Mrs. 

Zarina  Ramzan,  as  lessors.  The  lease  period  was  agreed  to  be 

effective from 01.10.2003 to 30.06.2020. The monthly rent for the 

first  one  year  of  the  tenancy  was  agreed  to  be  Rs.33,620/-.  This 

amount  was  to  be  enhanced  every  year  by  10%.  The  rent  for  the 

first one year was paid in advance.  

33.  The 

lease  agreement  with  respect  to  Unit  No.1  was 

executed  on  10.10.2003,  between  the  petitioner,  as  lessee,  and 

Chaudhry  Muhammad  Ramzan  Tahir,  as  lessor.  The  monthly  rent 

for the first one year of the tenancy was agreed to be Rs.19,965/-. 

The  rest  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  lease  agreement  are 

almost identical to those of lease agreement regarding Unit No.2.  

34.  The 

first  covenant  of  the 

lessee 

in  both  the 

lease 

agreements is as follows:-  

“1.  That after the expiry of the first one year the lessee shall 
pay the rent on quarterly basis in advance till 10th day of first 
month of every new period of rent to the Lessors regularly. In 

 
15 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

case of non-payment of the rent quarterly basis in advance till 10th 
day of first month of every new period of rent by the Lessee to the 
Lessors, the Lessee shall be considered defaulter and liable for 
ejectment.” 

35.  The primary ground on which the learned lower Courts have 

orders  the  eviction  of  the  petitioner  from  the  rented  premises  is 

default in the payment of rent in accordance with the terms of the 

lease agreements. The findings of the learned Rent Controller and 

the  learned  Appellate  Court  on  the  question  of  default  in  the 

payment of rent by the petitioner are as follows:-  

Findings of the  
learned Rent Controller  

Findings of the learned Appellate 
Court  

“15. 
In  the  light  of  above  discussion 
it is to be ascertained that the quarterly 
rent of demised premises was to be paid 
in advance before the 10th of each first 
the  appraisal  of 
month.  From 
the 
testimony 
is  substantially 
fact 
this 
emerged on the face of record that Ex-
R23 was prepared for  the period  of  09 
months  on  31.05.2007.    Besides  this 
there is a clear admission on the part of 
respondent  that  pay  orders  remitted  in 
lieu of rent was transferred in favour of 
petitioners or not. Likewise, the witness 
has  shown  his  inability  to  bring  on 
record any documents showing that the 
rent  from  November  2006  to  January 
2007  has  been  paid. 
  Hence,  the 
respondent  failed  to  explain  that  as  to 
why the rent since November 2006 was 
not  tendered  to  the  petitioners  on  due 
date as per terms and conditions of the 
lease  agreement  Mark-A.    Respondent 
has even not  produced any evidence to 
the  effect  that  petitioner  refused  to 
receive the rent, or he attempted to sent 
the  same  through  money  orders  and  
then  was  compelled  to  tendered  the 
same  in  court.  In  view  of  the  above 
clear  willful  default  in  payment  of  rent 
has  been  made  on  the  part  of  the 
respondent as the result, this ground is 
answered in affirmative” 

“9. 
Second point for consideration in the 
matter  in  hand  relates  to  default.    The 
respondent alleges that appellant committed 
default  in  payment  of  money  rent  since 
November,  2006,  whereas  latter  denied. 
Appellant  produced  Ex.R  2  to  Ex.R  20  in 
support  of  his  version.  RW  1  categorically 
acknowledged  that  the  quarterly  rent  of 
demised premises was to be paid in advance 
before 10th of each first month and thus non-
payment before 10th of each first month will 
be  considered  for  commission  of  default.  
Admittedly,  Ex.R  23  was  prepared  for  the 
monthly  rent  of  09  months  and  before  this 
no  payment  order  was  prepared  and  no 
documentary  evidence  has  been  proved 
regarding  payment  of  rent  from  November, 
2006  to  January,  2007,  ere  preparation  of 
draft is not sufficient to prove the version of 
appellant.  Even  if  as  per  version  of  the 
appellant,  the  default  is  considered  after 
lapse of 03 months time, even then in case of 
non-payment  of  above-mentioned 
rent, 
default would be considered and thus it has 
been  rightly  held  by  the  learned  Rent 
Controller that  willful default in payment of 
rent  has  been  made  on  the  part  of  the 
appellant  and  this  ground  was  correctly 
answered in affirmative.” 

36.  The petitioner entered the witness box as (R.W.1). His cross-

examination  shows  that  he  was  fully  aware  of  the  terms  and 

conditions of the lease agreements, including his obligation to pay 

rent  for  every  three  months  in  advance  –  by  the  10th  of  the  first 

 
 
 
 
 
 
16 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

month.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  contesting  parties  were  in 

unison on their submission that until October, 2006, the petitioner 

did not default in his obligation to pay rent in accordance with the 

terms of the lease agreements. The respondents’ case is that the 

petitioner  did  not  pay  rent  for  the  month  of  November  2006,  and 

that even if it is assumed that the petitioner had tendered rent for 

December,  2006 to  August,  2007,  (i.e.  nine months),  this  was  not 

until  31.05.2007  when 

the  pay  order 

for  an  amount  of 

Rs.6,45,010/- was alleged to have been issued.  

37.  Now the petitioner (R.W.1) in his cross-examination deposed 

as follows:-  

Mein nai pay order morkha 31.05.2007 mubligh 642,510/- jaari kr 
standard charted bank apnay jawab darkhawast k hath laf kia tha, 
usay batore ExR-25 tasleem krta hon. yeh durust/correct hai k 
mazkoora baala pay order December, 2006 tah August 2007, 9 
maa k kar'aahay/rent ki mad mein tha. 

38.  Under the terms of the lease agreements, the petitioner was 

required  to  pay  rent  in  advance  (by  the  10th  of  every  first  month) 

for  every  three  of  the  tenancy.  The  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner,  after  referring  to  the  petitioner’s  cross-examination, 

contended  that  a  pay  order  dated  31.05.2007  for  an  amount  of 

Rs.642,510/-  drawn  on  Standard  Chartered  Bank  was  paid  to  the 

respondents, and that this amount was paid as rent for December, 

2006 to August, 2007. Although, the respondents deny the receipt 

of this amount, even if it is assumed that this amount was paid, it 

violates  the  first  covenant  of  the  lessee  in  both  the  lease 

agreements.  Under  the  terms  of  the  lease  agreements,  quarterly 

rent was to be paid in advance prior to the 10th day of first month 

of  each  quarter.  Furthermore,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the 

petitioner  paid  rent  for  the  month  of  November,  2006.  Hence,  it 

does  not  lie  in  the  mouth  of  the  petitioner  to  contend  that  he  did 

not commit default in the payment of rent.   

39.  The  petitioner 

in  his  cross-examination  has  virtually 

admitted default in the payment of rent. If credence is to be given 

to  the  assertion  of  the  petitioner  that  the  respondents  were 

refusing  to  accept  the  rent,  there  was  nothing  preventing  the 

petitioner  to  make  a  timely  application  to  the  learned  Rent 

 
 
 
17 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

Controller  for  the  deposit  of  rent.  The  first  Explanation  to  the 

proviso to Section 17(2) of the IRRO reads as follows:- 

"(i)  The rent remitted by money order or tendered to the 
landlord in such manner as may be agreed upon by the landlord 
and the tenant or deposited in the office of the Controller shall be 
deemed to have been duly tendered; " (Emphasis added) 

40.  Whenever  a  landlord  is  reluctant  or  refuses  to  accept  rent 

from  a  tenant,  the  tenant  should  lose  no  time  in  making  an 

application to the learned Rent Controller for the deposit of rent in 

order  to protect  himself  from  being  termed  as  a "rent defaulter". 

Since  the  petitioner  did  not  make  such  an  application,  he  can 

make  no  grouse  against  and  facing  the  consequences  of  such 

default.  Hence,  the  petitioner  can  be  held  to  have  committed 

default in the payment of rent in accordance with the provisions of 

the lease agreement. I do not see jurisdictional infirmity or error in 

the  said  findings  of  the  learned  Rent  Controller  and  the  learned 

appellate Court. 

41.  The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that 

since  the  respondents  had  taken  the  position  that  the  lease 

agreement  had  expired,  therefore,  the  petitioner  stood  absolved 

from  paying  rent  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  lease 

agreement, and that rent would be payable in accordance with the 

statute  (IRRO),  is  not  tenable.  The  respondents’  contention  that 

the  lease  agreement  had  expired  was  not  correct.  The  lease 

agreement  was  valid  until  2020.  The  learned  Courts  below  had 

concurrently  held  so.  The  petitioner  could  not  take  advantage  of 

the respondents’ fallacious contention as to the expiry of the lease 

agreements  and  release  himself  from  the  liability  to  pay  rent  in 

accordance  with  the  first  covenant  of  the  lessee/petitioner  in  the 

lease  agreement.  Furthermore,  in  Paragraph  1  of  the  eviction 

petition,  the  respondents  had  inter alia  pleaded  that  the  lease 

agreement  had  ended  on  10.10.2006.  This  pleading  was 

controverted by the petitioner in his reply to the eviction petition, 

wherein it was pleaded that “[i]n fact, the lease period provided in 

the Agreement is until the year 2020 and the petitioners are well 

aware of this fact right from the beginning of the tenancy.”  The 

petitioner  could  not  take  a  vault  face  and  depart  from  his 

pleadings  by  contending  that  simply  because  the  respondents 

 
 
18 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

assert that the lease period had ended, he was not required to pay 

rent  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  lease  agreement.    Prior 

to the passing of the order under Section 17 (8) of the IRRO, there 

was no escape for the petitioner from his obligation to pay rent in 

accordance  with  the  proivsions  of  the  lease  agreements.  In  the 

case  of  Mrs.  Zehra  Begum  VS  M/s.  Pakistan  Burmah-Shell  Ltd., 

(PLD  1984  SC  38),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  has  quoted  with 

approval  the  following  passage  from  Halsbury's  Laws  of  England 

(4th Edition) Volume 27 para. 44:- 

 “It is most important to note that in both the public and private 
sectors as between the landlord and the tenant it is the contract 
made between them from which their respective rights derive and 
on to which the statute engrafts modifications or in respect of 
which it confers opportunities. The ordinary law of contract and 
the ordinary rules of law applying as between landlord and tenant 
continue to apply both in the private and the public sectors, 
subject to these special statutory modifications and additions. 
The law of landlord and tenant is therefore a topic of very 
uncertain definition and scope and in respect of any problem 
which arises as between landlord and tenant it is at all times 
important to consider whether there are statutory provisions of 
general application which impinge upon the rights of landlord and 
tenant without being conventionally regarded as part of the law of 
landlord and tenant.” 

42.  Another  ground  on  which  the  learned  Courts  below  have 

ordered the  ejectment of the petitioner from the rented premises 

is  that  the  petitioner  has  carried  out  structural  changes  in  the 

rented  premises.  Under  paragraph  3  of  the  covenants  of  the 

lessee  in  the  lease  agreement,  the  lessee  cannot  demolish  or 

damage the rented premises or remove any installation during the 

lease  period.  Furthermore,  the  lease  agreement  does  not  permit 

the  lessee  to  make  any  structural  alterations  or  additions  in  the 

rented  premises  without  the  prior  consent  of  the  lessor.  It  is  an 

admitted position  that the petitioner had engaged the services  of 

a  designer  to  carry  out  changes  and  modifications  in  the  rented 

premises.  

43.  The petitioner in support of his contention that no structural 

changes  had  been  made  at  the  rented  premises  or  that  the 

verandah  was  not  included  in  the  dining  hall  of  the  restaurant, 

placed  reliance  on  Ex.R-21  &  Ex.R-22.  Ex.R-21  is  an  offer  dated 

30.03.2004  from  the  Capital  Development  Authority  to  the 

petitioner for a license of open space / covered space adjacent to

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

Olive  Garden  Restaurant 

(Unit  No.1)  Gole  Market,  F-7/3, 

Islamabad.  Vide  Ex.R-22  (letter  dated  21.11.2004),  the  Capital 

Development  Authority  granted  a  license  to  the  petitioner  to  use 

the open and covered space adjacent to the restaurant for sitting 

purposes  on  the  terms  and  conditions  stipulated  therein.  The 

Capital  Development  Authority,  on 

the  application  of 

the 

petitioner, had permitted the petitioner to use the open space and 

covered  space  in  front  and  rear  of  the  restaurant  for  outdoor 

sitting  purpose  against  the  payment  of  a  license  fee.  This 

letter/offer  is  not  a  permission  from  the  Capital  Development 

Authority to carry out changes in the rented premises.   

44.  Even if it is assumed that the Capital Development Authority 

had  granted  the  petitioner  permission  to  carry  out  structural 

changes  in  the  rented  premises,  the  fact  remains  that  at  no 

material 

stage 

did 

the 

petitioner 

seek 

the 

lessor/landlord/respondents’ permission to carry out changes and 

modifications  in  the  rented  premises.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents was  correct in his submission that the  respondents’ 

testimony  about  the  conversion  of  the  verandah  into  the  dinning 

hall  had  gone  un-rebutted.  Indeed,  on  the  question  of  making 

structural  changes  in  the  rented  premises,  A.W.1  was  not  cross-

examined.  Hence,  the  learned  Rent  Controller  and  the  learned 

appellate Court had correctly found that the petitioner had carried 

out changes in the rented premises in violation of the terms of the 

lease agreements.  

45.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner that the co-owners have not signed the eviction petition 

with respect to Unit No.2, suffice it to say that it is well settled that 

a co-sharer  of the  property  was  entitled  to  file  ejectment  petition 

without  impleading  the  other  owners.  In  the  case  of  Muhammad 

Hanif  VS  Muhammad  Jamil  Turk  (2002  SCMR  429),  it  has  been 

held as follows:-  

“…general  rule  of  law  has  been  that  a  co-sharer  can  file 
ejectment proceedings against a tenant without impleading other 
co-sharers. The wisdom behind such principle is that, co-sharer 
acts on behalf of and represents the, interest of all the co-owners 
of the property.” 

 
 
20 

W.P.Nos.532 & 591 of 2016 

46.  Law to this effect has also been laid down in the cases of Dr. 

Masuma  Hasan  VS  Muhammad  Hafeez  (2015  MLD  1577),  Mohsin 

Jabeen  VS  Abdul  Sattar  Shekha  (2007  YLR  2783),  and  Mrs. 

Escolastica  VS  Peter  D'souza  (1986  CLC  1472).  As  Chaudhry 

Muhammad Ishaq was one of the co-owners of Unit No.2, and had 

singed  the  eviction  petition,  the  non-signing  of  the  eviction 

petition  by  the  other  co-owners  is  without  any  consequents. 

Moreover, it is  not  the  petitioner’s  case that  the other  co-owners 

had  no  grouse  or  complaint  against  the  petitioner  or  wanted  him 

to continue occupying the Unit No.2 as a tenant.    

47.  As  regards  the  contention  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

respondents  that  the  learned  Rent  Controller  should  have  also 

allowed  the  respondents’  eviction  petition  on  the  ground  of 

personal bona fide need, it is an admitted position that the rented 

premises  are  commercial  properties.  The  second  recital  of  the 

lease  agreement  shows  that  the  lease  period  is  fixed  with  effect 

from  01.10.2003  to  30.06.2020.  The  eviction  petitions  were  filed 

during the subsistence of the lease period. 

48.  Now,  since  the 

lease  period  was  from  10.10.2003  to 

30.06.2020,  it  needs  to  be  determined  whether  the  ground  of 

personal  bona  fide  need  was  available  to  the  landlords  for  the 

eviction  of  the  petitioner.  Section  17  (4)  (b)  and  its  first  proviso 

reads as follows:-  

“(4) A landlord may apply to the Controller for an. order directing 
the tenant to put the landlord in possession, 
a) ….  
b) in the case of a commercial building or rented land, if he 
requires it in good faith for his own use or for the use of any 
member of his family: 
Provided that where the tenancy is for a specified period agreed 
upon between the landlord and the tenant, the landlord shall not 
be entitled to apply under this subsection before the expiry of 
such period.” 

49.  As  in  the  case  at  hand,  the  tenancy  agreed  between  the 

petitioner  and  landlords  was  for  a  specified  period  (i.e.  from 

10.10.2003  to  30.06.2020),  the  landlord  was  not  entitled,  prior  to 

the  expiry  of  the  lease  period,  to  apply  for  the  eviction  of  the 

petitioner  on  the  ground  of  the  landlord’s  requirement  of  the 

rented premises, which are commercial in nature, in good faith or 

for the use of any of his family member.

50. 

In the case of Arshad Ali VS Mst. Zubaidah Bibi (2008 SCMR 

1457),  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan,  while  interpreting 

the first proviso to Section 13(3)(ii)(c) of the West Pakistan Urban 

Rent  Restriction  Ordinance,  1959,  which  is  in pari materia  to  the 

first proviso to Section 17(4)(b) of the IRRO, held as follows:- 

“Under the law, even in the presence of dire personal need of the 
landlord, he was debarred from filing the ejectment petition 
before the expiry of the period of lease fixed in the agreement …” 

51.  Therefore, the learned Courts below were correct in holding 

that the ground of personal bona fide need of the landlords for the 

rented  premises  during  the  subsistence  of  the  lease  was  not 

available to the landlords/respondents.  

52.  During the course of the arguments, the learned counsel for 

the  contesting  respondents,  did  not  make  any  serious  effort  to 

show  that  the  signatures  of  the  lessors  on  the  lease  agreements 

were forgeries or that the signatures  were  obtained fraudulently. 

No  specific  issue  was  framed  by  the  learned  Rent  Controller  on 

this matter. Therefore, I do not feel the necessity to delve into this 

controversy.  Furthermore,  since  I  do  not  find  any  reason  to 

interfere  with  the  concurrent  findings  of  the 

learned  Rent 

Controller  and  the  learned  appellate  Court,  there  is  no  reason  to 

delve  into  the  cross-objections  raised  by  the  learned  counsel  for 

the  respondents,  regarding  the  non-registration  of  the  lease 

agreements. 

53.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  petitions  are  dismissed  with 

no order as to costs.
