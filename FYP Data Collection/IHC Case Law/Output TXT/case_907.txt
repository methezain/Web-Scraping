Proceedings 
20.12.2021  Mr. Yasir Abbasi, Advocate for the petitioner. 

Order with signature of Judge and that of 
parties or counsel where necessary.  

  The  petitioner  has  impugned  judgment 

and  decree  dated  28.10.2020  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  and  judgment 

and  decree  passed 

in  appeal  dated 

18.10.2021  by  the learned  Additional  District 

Judge (East), Islamabad. 

2.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

contended  that  it  was  agreed  between  the 

parties 

during 

pre 

trial 

settlement 

negotiations  that  respondent  No.1  would  not 

press  for  recovery  of  maintenance  for  a 

period prior to filing of the suit. But that such 

trial  settlement  proceedings 

failed  and 

subsequently  the  suit  was  decided  on  the 

basis  of  the  trial  conducted.  He  contended 

that infirmity in the impugned judgments and 

decrees was that maintenance had been fixed 

from  October  2016,  when  the  custody  of  the 

minor  was  handed  over  to  respondent  No.1, 

as  opposed  to  from  the  date  of  filing  of  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    -2-             Writ Petition No.4366 of 2021 

suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance.  He  pointed 

out 

that 

in  para-11  of 

the 

impugned 

judgment  dated  28.10.2020,  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  it  had  been 

observed  that  respondent  No.2  was  entitled 

to  recovery  of  maintenance  from  October 

2018.  But 

despite 

such 

observation, 

maintenance had been awarded from October 

2016  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  and 

this  error  appearing  on  the  record  had  not 

been  appreciated  by  the  learned  Additional 

District  Judge  either.  He  further  contended 

that  respondents  had  failed  to  establish  that 

they have not received any maintenance from 

the petitioner after October 2016, which they 

were  obliged 

to  do  as 

the  onus 

for 

establishing  failure  of  the  petitioner  to  pay 

maintenance was on the respondents. 

3.   The  reference 

to  October  2018 

in  

para-11 of the impugned judgment passed by 

the 

learned  Judge  Family  Court  dated 

28.10.2020  appears  to  be  a  clerical  mistake, 

as  earlier  in  the  said  paragraph  the  learned 

Judge  Family  Court  has  observed  that  fact 

that  respondent  No.1  had  got  the  custody  of 

her  minor  son  i.e.  respondent  No.2  through 

the  Court  in  October  2016  is  an  admitted 

fact.  The  learned  Judge  Family  Court  also 

observed  that  receipts  of  certain  money 

 
 
 
 
 
    -3-             Writ Petition No.4366 of 2021 

orders  in  lieu  of  payment  of  maintenance 

were  produced  by  the  petitioner,  but  such 

money orders did not reflect any date and did 

not establish that maintenance had been paid 

by  the  petitioner  to  respondent  No.1  since 

October 2016. 

4.   The  impugned  judgment  and  decree 

dated 28.10.2020 is a reasoned one, wherein 

after  appreciation  the  evidence  produced 

before  the  Court,  it  granted  maintenance  to 

respondents  No.1  &  2  from  the  date  from 

which handing over of custody of respondent 

No.2 to respondent No.1 had been  admitted. 

It was in view of appraisal of the evidence as 

well  as  the  reasoning  of  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court 

in  her 

judgment  dated 

28.10.2020 

that 

the 

learned  Additional 

District  Judge  passed  the  judgment  and 

decree  dated  18.10.2021  upholding 

the 

judgment  and  decree  of  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court. 

5.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

drew  the  attention  of  this  Court  to  three 

money  orders  in  the  aggregate  amount  of 

Rs.10,000/-  which  are  undated  and  have 

been  referred  to  in  the  impugned  judgment 

and  decree  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court.  The  said  receipts  do  not 

 
 
 
 
 
    -4-             Writ Petition No.4366 of 2021 

establish  that  the  petitioner  has  been  paying 

maintenance  for  the  upkeep  of  his  son  

i.e. respondent No.2 since October 2016. The 

learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  failed 

to  point  out  any  infirmity  in  the  impugned 

judgments and decrees and has further failed 

to  point  to  any  record  which  has  been  

mis-read or any evidence which has not been 

read  by  the  learned  Judge  Family  Court  and 

the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  while 

passing their receptive judgments. 

6.   In  view  of  the  above,  the  petition  is 

without merit and is dismissed in limine.
