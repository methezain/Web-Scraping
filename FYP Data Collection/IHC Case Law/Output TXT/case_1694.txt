The above  mentioned  judgment  was  assailed  in appeal  however,  the  appeal was 

dismissed  being  time  barred  vide  order  dated  20.03.2019 and  the application  for 

condonation  of delay  was also turned  down.  Hence, instant writ petition. 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  petitioner  is  a  serving 

Civil  Servant  (BPS-21) and  presently  posted  in  Embassy  of  Pakistan  in  Brazil, 

who  married  with  respondent  No.ion  25.07.1989, whereas  three  children  were 

born  from  the  said  wedlock  and  as  such  divorce  took  place  on  13.01.2011. The 

minor  Myra  Saqib is living  with the; petitioner  and  other  two minors  Sahar  Saqib 

and  Minhaaj Saqib are  living  with  Ifother  but Sahar  Saqib is 28 years  of age born 

on  08.07.1990 and  is  not  entitled  for  any  maintenance,  whereas  Minhaaj  Saqib 

(son) born  on  20.10.2001  and  as such  trial  Court  has  not considered  the  evidence 

in  its  true  perspective  whereby  exorbitant  rate  of  maintenance  has  been  fixed 

despite  the  fact  that  petitioner  bei?g  civil  servant  is  not  in  position  to  pay  the 

maintenance  beyond  his  salary  paid  by  the  Government; 

that  properties 

highlighted  by respondents  before  re Courts  below  are  inherited  properties  and 

as  such  petitioner  being  civil  servjnt  is  not  in  position  to  maintain  the  minors 

through  exorbitant  rate  of maintenance:  that this  is second  round  of proceedings 

and  petitioner  was  non-suited  on hrper  technical  grounds  as judgment  & decree 

I 

was  passed  on  06.12.2018 when  petitioner  was  abroad  in  connection  with  his 

I 

official  duties  being  Ambassador  of  Pakistan  and  came  back  to  Pakistan  on 

03.03.2019  and  his  date  of  knowledge 

is  04.03.2019,  where-after  he  filed 

application  of  certified  copy  on  05.03.2019, which  were  received  on  13.03.2019 

W.P.No.1191  2019 

3 

and  he  immediately  filed  the  appe~l  on  14.03.2019 but  despite  this  fact  he  was 

I 

not  given benefit of Section 13  of Limitation  Act, which  provides  the condonation 

if the appellant  was  out of country  in the relevant  time. 

4. 

Conversely,  learned  counsel  for respondent  No.3 contends  that  petitioner 

is habitual  defaulter  in payment  of maintenance  who  has not  paid  a single penny 

of maintenance  despite  the  fact that judgment  &  decree  was  passed  and  as such 

he is not entitled  for any  relief; that ground  raised  for condonation  of delay  is not 

justiciable  under  the  law  as  no  s~fficient  cause  has  been  explained  in  the 

i 
i 

application. 

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard,  record  perused. 

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  petitioner  is  mainly  aggrieved  with  the 

judgment  of appellate  Court  dated  20.03.2019, whereby  appeal  filed by petitioner 

against  the  judgment  &  decree  of  learned  trial  Court  dated  06.12.2018 was 

dismissed  being  time  barred.  The  petitioner  who  is  civil  servant  of  BPS-21 was 

posted  as  Ambassador  of Pakistan  i  Brazil and  he  has  taken  the  stance  that  he 

was  out  of country  in  connection 

ith  his  official duties  and  on  his  arrival  he 

came to know  that  a decree  has  bee  passed  against  him,  where-after  he filed an 

application  for certified  copy  on 05.~3.2019 which  were  supplied  by the  office on 

13.03.2019, where-after  he  filed  app~al  before  learned  Additional  District  Judge 

! 

on  14.03.2019 but  despite  all  these  justified  reasons  his  appeal  was  dismissed 

being  time  barred,  despite  the  fact that  one  of the  respondents  Sahar  Saqib is 28 

years of age and  was  not minor  and  he is not  entitled  for maintenance.  It has also 

been argued  that  petitioner  being citil servant  placed  copy  of his salary  slip on 

record  but  maintenance  fixed  by  th 

trial  Court  is  on  higher  side  which  is  not 

i 

permissible  under  these  circumstan  es.  In  order  to  resolve  the  controversy  it  is 

necessary to decide  the question  of limitation  at the first instance. 

7. 

As per  record  judgment  &  decree  was  passed  on  06.12.2018 by the  Judge 

Family  Court  against  the  petitioner,  however,  petitioner  came  to  Pakistan  on 

03.03.2019 and  as per  his own  version  his date  of knowledge  is 04.03.2019 and  he 

W.P.  No.1191/2019 

4 

filed  application  for  issuance  of  certified  copy  of  the  judgment  &  decree  on 

05.03.2019, which  were  supplied  to tlim on 13.03.2019 and  he  filed  appeal  before 

the  Additional  District Judge  (West)j  Islamabad  on 14.03.2019 as such  his appeal 

was  time  barred  for  55 days  at  the  initial  stage,  therefore,  question  of limitation 

requires  appreciation  in the light  of ~ection  13  of the  Limitation  Act, 1908, which 

is as under:- 

I 

"13.  Exclusion  of  time  of  defendant's  absence  from  Pakistan  and 

certain  other 

territories:-  Ij computing 

the  period  of  limitation 

prescribed for  any  suit,  the  time  during  which  the  defendant  has  been 

absent from  [Pakistan] and from  the  territories beyond  [Pakistan] under 

the administration  of [the [Federal Government]] ***shall  be excluded". 

8. 

The above referred provision,provides protection to any person who was 

not available in Pakistan  and  period  :of limitation  shall be reckoned  from the date 

of his arrival.  It has  not been deniedlby  respondent's  side that petitioner  was not 

out  of  country  and  was  posted  being  Ambassador  and  copy  of  passport 

I 

appended  with  this  petition  spells o~t exit and  entry  in Pakistan  which  is in line 

with  the  dates  referred  by the  petititner.  It is trite  law  that  parties  should  not  be 

knocked  out  on  technical  reasons  and  their  right  should  be  decided  on  merits. 

Reliance  is  placed  upon  2000  scMR  830  (Muhammad  Yaqub  VS  Pakistan 

Petroleum),  and  such  type  of situation  requires  adjudication  of matter  on  merit 

and  not on technical reasons. 

I 

9. 

I  have  also  attended  the  prpposition  in  the  light  of  Section  13  of  the 

Limitation  Act, 1908, which  has  been  discussed  in  the  reported  cases PLD  2006 

! 
I 

SC  457  (Mst.  Farah  Naz  VS  Tudge]  Family  Court,  Sahiwal  and  others)  in  the 

i 

following manner:- 

On  its  part,  High  Court  also  bommitted  serious  error  of  law  by  non  

suiting  the appellant with  the otservation  that period for  recovery of past 

maintenance  being  three  years,  without  citing  any  provision  of  the 

Limitation  Act  proceeded to  endorse  the judgments  of  the  two  Courts 

belotn.  Indeed  the  claim for  past  maintenance  would  be  governed  by 

Article  120 of the Schedule to  the Limitation Act 1908, which prescribes a 

W.P.  No.1191/2019 

5 

period of six  years  in  a  suit for  1hich  no period is  provided elsewhere  in 

this Schedule from  the date when  the right  to sue accrues.  Furthermore, by 

reason of section 13 of the Limit  tion Act  1908 in computing  the period of 

limitation  prescribed for any suit  the  time during  which  the defendant had 

been absent from  Pakistan and  m  the  territories beyond Pakistan under 

administration  of  the  Central  G  vernment  shall  be  excluded.  Assuming, 

without  conceding,  even  if the 

riod  of limitation  for  such  suit  be  three 

years, in tiieto  of the admitted ab~ence of the respondent from  Pakistan, the 

period  of  his  absence from  Pakistan  shall  be  excluded  for  reckoning  the 

period  of  limitation.  We  are  supported  in  this  view  by  the  precedents 
reported as Muhammad  Nawaz  o.  Khurshid  Begum  (PLO  1972 SC 302), 

Mst.  Bushra  Qasim  v.  Dr.  Abdir,l  Rasheed and others  (1993 CLC  2063), 

I 

Mst.  Zaibun  v.  Mehrban  (PLd  2004  SC  (AJ&K)  25)  and  Mst.  Anar 

Mamana  and  another  v.  Misal  ul  and  2  others  (PLO  2005  Peshawar 

194). 

10. 

Similarly,  identical  question  as  also  been  adjudicated  in  another  case 

reported  as 2015 YLR  2375  Mst.  K  lsoom  Bibi  VS Muhammad  Waseem  and  3 

others) and following view has been  aken:- 

The  bare  reading  of  the  section  ibid,  reveals  that  it  provides  that  in 

computing  the period of limitation prescribed for  any  suit,  the  time during 

which  the  defendant  has  been:  absent  from  Pakistan  and  from 

I 

the 

territories  beyond  Pakistan  un}ter  the  administration  of  the  Central 

Gooernmeni  shall  be  excluded. 

is  section  makes  no exception for  cases 

in  which  the  cause  of  action  ar  se  in  a foreign  country  or for  cases  in 

which  the  defendant  was  in fore gn  country  at  the  time  of  the  accrual  of 

cause of action,  in all cases,  the  t me during  which the defendant  has been 

absent  from  Pakistan  must  be  excluded  in  computing 

the  period  of 

limitation.  Section  13 does  not st  te  that it must  be one continuous  period 
and  there  is  no  scope for  the  interpretation.  that  if the  defendant  had  at 

intervals  been  within  Pakistan, .  the  plaintiff  cannot  get  benefit  of  this 

section.  Even  if the defendant is absent,  not at a continuous  stretch, but at 

intervals,  still  it  will  be  time during  which  the  defendant  has  been  absent 

from  the  country  and  the  plaintiff  would  be  entitled  to  deduct  the  total 

! 

period of absence of the defendant from  Pakistan. 

I 

11. 

The above referred  view in terms of Section 13  of Limitation Act has to be 

considered  valid  for proposition  in hand  and  learned  District Judge  is bound  to 

W.P.  No.1191/2019 

6 

apply  it  by  all  means  as  Section  13'  of  Limitation  Act,  1908 is  an  exception  to 

general  rules  and  clearly  provides  c 

ain rights  to  all those  individuals  who  are 

out  of Pakistan  as their  period  of Ii  · tation  provided  under  the  law  is extended 

and  period  in which  petitioner  was  out  of country  has  to be excluded,  therefore, 

appellate  Court  has not considered  this aspect  in its true  perspective  and  has not 

applied  the  law  in  a  proper  manner! as  reasons  rendered  by  the  petitioner  falls 

i 

within  the  purview  of sufficient cause in which  he  is entitled  for condonation  of 

delay,  although  grounds  referred  in .his application  are  clearly  established  from 

record. 

12. 

In  the  light  of  above  mentil  ned  discussion  and  ratio  settled  by  the 

superior  courts  it  has  been  seen  th  t  appellate  Court  has  not  applied  the  true 

intent  of  Section  13  of  the  Limit  tion  Act,  1908  and  has  not  applied  the 

substantive  exemption  available  to  he  petitioner  in  terms  of  Section  13 of  the 

I 

Limitation  Act, 1908, hence,  order  oJ appellate  Court  is illegal  and  this Court  in 

terms  of Article  199 of the  Constitution  of Islamic Republic  of Pakistan,  1973 is 

competent  to  correct  such  mistakes  in judicial  review,  therefore,  instant  petition 

is allowed,  impugned  order  dated  20.03.2019 is illegal and  the  same  is hereby set 

aside. The appeal  filed by the petitioner  shall be deemed  to be pending  before the 

learned  Additional  District  judge  <{est),  Islamabad,  who  is directed  to  decide 

the  appeal  on  merit  after  hearing  ~he  parties  in  accordance  with  law  within 

period  of 02 months.  Both the particsj  are directed  to appear  before the concerned 

Court on 02.03.2020.
