                              02.03.2022.  Mr. Javaid Iqbal Khan, Advocate for Petitioner. 

Learned counsel for Petitioner states that 

divorce  certificate  issued  by  Respondent  No. 

2  dated  03.11.2021  is  void  abinitio  as  no 

reconciliation  proceedings  were  held  due  to 

the  fact  that  notice  was  not  served  upon  the 

Petitioner  where  she  was  residing  outside  of 

the 

country 

i.e  U.K, 

therefore, 

the 

proceedings  before  Respondent  No.2  was  not 

in  the  knowledge  of  Petitioner.  The  learned 

counsel  further  submits  that  the  Petitioner 

had  already  instituted  divorce  proceedings 

against  Respondent  No.  1  in  UK  wherein 

Respondent  No.  1  had  entered  appearance, 

therefore,  he  had  knowledge  of  her  UK 

address.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  The  question  that  arises  is  whether  the 

divorce  certificate  has  become  invalid  on 

account  of  failure  of  service  of  notice  on  the 

wife despite passage of ninety days.  

3.  Matter requires consideration.   

4.  Let notice be issued to the respondents.  

C.M No. 01/2022 

Exemption sought for is allowed, subject 

to all just and legal exceptions.
