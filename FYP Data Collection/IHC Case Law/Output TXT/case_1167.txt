necessary. 

petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  writ  petition 

filed  under  Article  199  of  the  Constitution 

of  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan,  1973,  the 

petitioner  has  assailed  the  legality  and 

validity  of  judgment  and  decree  dated 

15.02.2018  passed  by  the  learned  Senior 

Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge),  West-

Islamabad  as  well  as  Order  dated 

03.07.2021  passed  by 

the 

learned 

Additional District Judge, West-Islamabad.  

02. 

Succinctly, 

stated 

the 

facts 

mentioned in the writ petition are that the 

petitioner  and  respondent  No.  1  were 

married  on  05.10.2008  under  the  Muslim 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

Rites  and  Rukhsati 

took  place  on 

15.11.2008.  Out  of  said  wedlock,  the 

spouses  were  blessed  with  two  daughters 

i.e. (1) Sadia Mahmood, D.O.B 16.06.2010 

and 

(2) 

Amna  Mahmood,  D.O.B 

03.01.2012,  who  are  residing  with  the 

petitioner  /  real  mother  being  natural 

guardian.  During  the  abadi  period,  the 

petitioner 

always 

performed 

her 

matrimonial  obligations  as  an  obedient 

and  faithful  wife  but  on  the  other  hand 

respondent  No.  1  always  ignored  the 

petitioner  as  well  as  minor  daughters and 

failed  to  perform  his  responsibilities  as 

responsible  husband  and 

father.  The 

petitioner 

always 

requested 

the 

respondent  No.  1  to  mend  his  behavior 

but  all  in  vain,  thereafter,  on  02.10.2012, 

respondent  No.  1  expelled  the  petitioner 

along  with  minor  daughters  from  his 

house.  The  petitioner  tried  her  level  best 

for  reconciliation  but  respondent  No.  1 

was  not 

interested 

to  continue 

the 

matrimonial  life,  therefore,  the  petitioner 

 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

had no other option except to file the suit 

for  dissolution  of  marriage,  recovery  of 

maintenance  and  dowry  articles.  During 

the  proceedings,  pre-trial  reconciliation 

proceedings  were  conducted  by 

the 

learned  Family  Court,  which  ended  in 

failure, therefore, the suit of the petitioner 

to  the  extent  of  dissolution  of  marriage 

was  decreed  u/s  10(4)  of  Family  Courts 

Act,  1964  vide  order  dated  17.04.2014. 

The  Trial  Court  partially  decreed  the  suit 

of  the  petitioner  vide  judgment  /  decree 

dated  15.02.2018.  The  petitioner  as  well 

as  respondent  No.  1  separately  filed 

appeals  against  the  judgment  /  decree 

dated  15.02.2018  before 

the 

learned 

District 

Judge, 

Islamabad,  both 

the 

appeals 

were 

dismissed 

through 

consolidated judgment dated 17.11.2018. 

03. 

That  since  02.10.2012,  petitioner 

being 

the 

real  mother  and  natural 

guardian 

is 

looking  after 

the  minor 

daughters in better sense and is providing 

all  the  amenities  of  life  to  the  minors  at 

 
 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

her own source of income, both the minor 

daughters  are  studying  in  schools  of 

repute. In the meanwhile, respondent No. 

1  filed  the  petition  u/s  25  of  Guardian  & 

Wards Act, 1890 at Islamabad, which was 

allowed  vide  Judgment  dated  15.02.2018. 

Being  aggrieved  the  petitioner  filed  an 

appeal  which  was  dismissed  vide  order 

dated  03.07.2021  by 

the  Court  of 

Additional District Judge, West-Islamabad. 

04. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter  alia  contends  that  the  impugned 

order  dated  03.07.2021  as  well  as  the 

judgment and decree passed by the Senior 

Civil  Judge-III,  (Guardian  Judge),  West-

Islamabad are against the law and facts of 

the  case  thus  not  sustainable  in  the  eyes 

of  law;  minors  are  being  brought-up  by 

the  petitioner  since 

their  birth  and 

respondent  No.  1  has  not  shown  any 

sense  of  responsibility  or  interest  towards 

the minors; the learned Trial and appellate 

Courts / respondents No. 2 & 3 passed the 

impugned  orders  without  applying  their 

 
 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

judicial  minds  in  total  disregard  of  the 

material  available  on  record.  He  has 

further  contended  that  both  the  Courts  / 

respondent No. 2 & 3 didn’t appreciate the 

important  fact  that  respondent  No.  1  is 

himself  dependent  upon  his  brothers  as 

per  his  own  statement  made  before  the 

Court.  The  learned  appellate  Court  / 

respondent  No.  2  has  decided  the  matter 

on  mere  technicalities  and  not  on  merits 

rather  has  misinterpreted  the  case  law 

cited  in  its  order  and  has  prayed  for 

setting aside of both the impugned orders. 

05.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

06. 

The 

impugned 

Judgment  and 

Decree  dated  15.02.2018  have  been 

passed  mainly  on  the  ground  that  the 

petitioner  has 

contracted  a 

second 

marriage and also gave birth of a son from 

her  second  marriage.  The  petitioner  has 

denied  the  fact  of  contracting  the  second 

marriage, 

in 

her 

cross-examination 

recorded  on  oath  on  20.01.2018,  in  the 

Court  of  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge-III, 

 
 
 
 
6 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

(Guardian  Judge),  West-Islamabad,  she 

has stated that; 

رسودی دبشی رک 

“یہ طلغ ےہ ہک میں ےن 

لی ےہ ۔یہ طلغ ےہ ہک میں ےن للاب مبنی 

رسودی دبشی رک لی ےہ ۔

صخش ےس 

یہ ھبی طلغ ےہ ہک سا ےس میار ایک ةیبٹ 

ھبی ےہ”۔ 

Whereas, the real mother of the petitioner 

has  stated  on  oath 

in  her  cross-

examination in the same Court that; 

 لعیہ ہلئبن ےک 

لوئسم

 ےہ ہک 

“یہ تسرد

ذنوبخ بک مبن للاب ےہ ۔یہ ھبی 

ےرسود

 بک مبن 

ےساون

 ےہ ہک میےر 

تسرد

وبشیز ےہ”۔ 

07.  Above  mentioned  two  contradictory 

statements 

clearly  prove 

that 

the 

petitioner  has  given  a  false  statement  on 

oath  in  the  Court  of  Senior  Civil  Judge, 

(Guardian  Judge),  West-Islamabad.  That 

giving of false statement / evidence before 

the Court is punishable under Section 193 

P.P.C,  which  is  reproduced  hereunder  for 

ready reference; 

“Whoever  intentionally  gives 

false evidence in any stage of a 

judicial proceeding, or fabricates 

false evidence for the purpose of 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
7 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

being  used  in  any  stage  of  a 

judicial  proceeding,  shall  be 

punished with imprisonment of 

either  description  for  a  term, 

which  may  extend  to  seven 

years, and shall also be liable to 

fine; and whoever, intentionally 

gives or fabricates false evidence 

in  any  other  case,  shall,  be 

punished with imprisonment of 

either  description"  for  a  term 

which may extend to three years, 

and shall also be liable to fine”. 

08. 

Petitioner  has  neither  denied  the 

fact  of  contracting  second  marriage  and 

giving  birth  to  a  son  from  her  second 

husband,  in  the  pleadings  of  her  appeal 

nor in the instant writ petition, the counsel 

of  petitioner  has  also  not  denied  the  said 

fact during his arguments. 

09.  As  the  petitioner  is  a  lady  and 

mother  of  the  minor  children,  hence  this 

Court  while  showing  restraint 

is  not 

passing  any  order  for  initiating  criminal 

proceeding  against  her  for  giving  false 

statement  /  evidence 

in 

the 

judicial 

proceedings / Court of law.  

 
 
 
 
 
8 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

10. 

It  is  admitted  during  the  evidence 

that  respondent  No.  1  /  father  of  the 

minors  has  not  contracted  the  second 

marriage.  As  far  as  the  impugned  order 

dated 03.07.2021 of the learned Additional 

District 

Judge,  West-Islamabad 

is 

concerned,  the  impugned  Judgment  and 

Decree  was  passed  on  15.02.2018  by  the 

Senior  Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge), 

West-Islamabad  and  appeal  was  filed  in 

the Court of learned District Judge, West-

Islamabad  on  31.03.2021  i.e.  with  the 

delay  of  more  than  3  years,  without  any 

plausible justification. 

11. 

That concurrent findings of both the 

Courts below are against the petitioner, as 

this  Court  is  the  Court  of  equity  and 

Petitioner 

for 

equitable 

relief  was 

supposed  to  put-forth  some  convincing 

materials  which  would  have  justified  the 

filing  of  her  appeal  after  considerable 

delay.  As  it  is  well  settled  principle  of 

equity that only vigilant not the indolent is 

to  get  the  relief  from  Court  of  equity  or 

 
 
 
 
9 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

law  respecting  her  right  which  has  been 

violated  or  infringed.  Petitioner  could  not 

satisfy  this  Court  as  to  why  she  remained 

in deep slumber for such a long period for 

realization  of  her  legal  rights  before  this 

Court  which  she  alleges  to  have  been 

violated by the respondent / plaintiff. 

12. 

It  has  been  laid  down  by  the 

Hon’ble  Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  in  a 

case 

titled  as  “Water  and  Power 

Development Authority” (1988 SCMR 

1354), that: 

“It is well settled that after the 

prescribed period of limitation has 

elapsed,  the  door  of  justice  is 

closed and no plea of injustice, 

hardship or ignorance can be of 

any  avail  unless  the  delay  is 

properly explained and accounted 

for”. 

13.  That 

in 

the 

recent  authoritative 

judgment  of  larger  bench  of  the  Hon’ble 

Supreme  Court  of  Pakistan  titled  as 

“Khushi Muhammad and others VS 

Mst. Fazal Bibi and other” (PLD 2016 

SC 872), it has been laid down that: 

 
 
 
 
10 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

“Before 

considering 

the 

propositions above, it is expedient 

to  mention  certain  salient 

features which have been settled 

over  a  period  of  time  by  the 

superior Courts for the purposes 

of  interpretation  of  the  law  of 

limitation. These are:- 

i.  The law of limitation is 

a  statute  of  repose, 

designed to quieten title and 

to  bar  stale  and  water-

logged disputes and is to be 

strictly  complied  with. 

Statutes  of  limitation  by 

their very nature are strict 

and inflexible. The Act does 

not confer a right; it only 

regulates the rights of the 

parties.  Such  a  regulatory 

enactment  cannot  be 

allowed to extinguish vested 

rights  or  curtail  remedies, 

unless all the conditions for 

extinguishment  of  rights 

and curtailment of remedies 

are  fully  complied with  in 

letter and spirit. There is no 

scope in limitation law for 

any  equitable  or  ethical 

construction  to  get  over 

them.  Justice,  equity  and 

good  conscience  do  not 

 
 
 
11 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

override  the 

law  of 

limitation. Their object is to 

prevent stale demands and 

so  they  ought  to  be 

construed strictly; 

ii.  The 

hurdles 

of 

limitation cannot be crossed 

under  the  guise  of  any 

hardships  or 

imagined 

inherent 

discretionary 

jurisdiction  of  the  court. 

Ignorance, 

negligence, 

mistake  or  hardship  does 

not save limitation, nor does 

poverty of the parties; 

iii.  It  is  salutary  to 

construe  exceptions  or 

exemptions to a provision in 

a statute of limitation rather 

liberally  while  a  strict 

construction is enjoined as 

regards the main provision. 

For when such a provision is 

set up as a defence to an 

action, it has to be clearly 

seen  if  the  case  comes 

strictly within the ambit of 

the provision;   

iv.  There is absolutely no 

room for the exercise of any 

imagined judicial discretion 

vis-à-vis interpretation of a 

 
 
 
 
 
12 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

provision, 

whatever 

hardship  may  result  from 

following 

strictly 

the 

statutory provision. There is 

no scope for any equity. The 

court  cannot  claim  any 

special  inherent  equity 

jurisdiction; 

v.  A statute of limitation 

instead of being viewed in 

an unfavorable light, as an 

unjust  and  discreditable 

defence,  should  have 

received such support from 

courts of justice as would 

have made it what it was 

intended emphatically to be, 

a statute of repose. It can be 

rightly stated that the plea 

of  limitation  cannot  be 

deemed  as  an  unjust  or 

discreditable defence. There 

is  nothing  morally  wrong 

and 

there 

is 

no 

disparagement to the party 

pleading it. It is not a mere 

technical plea as it is based 

on sound public policy and 

no one should be deprived of 

the right he has gained by 

the law. It is indeed often a 

righteous defence. The court 

has  to  only  see  if  the 

 
 
 
13 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

defence is good in law and 

not  if  it  is  moral  or 

conscientious;  

vi.  The  intention  of  the 

Law of Limitation is not to 

give a right where there is 

not one, but to interpose a 

bar after a certain period to 

a suit to enforce an existing 

right; 

vii.  The Law of Limitation 

is  an  artificial  mode 

conceived  to  terminate 

justiciable disputes. It has 

therefore  to  be  construed 

strictly  with  a  leaning  to 

benefit the suit or; 

viii.  Construing 

the 

Preamble and Section 5 of 

the Act it will be seen that 

the fundamental principle is 

to induce the claimants to 

be prompt in claiming rights. 

Unexplained delay or laches 

on the part of those who are 

expected to be aware and 

conscious  of  the  legal 

position  and  who  have 

facilities  for  proper  legal 

assistance  can  hardly  be 

encouraged or countenanced”.  

 
 
 
 
 
14 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

14. 

It  is  trite  that  in  order  to  get 

discretionary  and  equitable  relief,  the 

parties should approach to the Courts with 

clean hands. Reference in this regard may 

be made to the following case laws:- 

(i) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

“Shafqatullah  and  others  VS 

District  and  Sessions  Judge, 

Nowshera,  N.W.F.P  and  4 

others” (2001 SCMR 274), it has 

been held as follows:- 

“It would also appear from 

the  record  that  the 

petitioners 

did 

not 

approach  the  High  Court 

with clean hands entitling 

them to the discretionary, 

equitable  relief  under  the 

Constitutional jurisdiction”. 

(ii) 

In  a  case  titled  as  “Manzoor 

Hussain  and  3  others  VS 

Muhammad  Siddique”  (2000 

CLC 623 [Lahore]), it  has  been 

held as follows:- 

 
 
 
15 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

“The  grant  or  refusal  of 

declaration  is  essentially 

discretionary  and  in  this 

case,  to  my  mind,  the 

plaintiff  had  forfeited  his 

right to an equitable relief 

by putting up a false case”. 

The  same  principle  has  been  laid  down  in 

cases  titled  as  “Shahnaz  Parveen  and 

another VS Javed Yaqoob and other” 

(2020  MLD  638  [Islamabad])  and 

“University of the Punjab and another 

VS Malik Jehangir Khan” (1994 PLC(CS) 

314 [Lahore]). 

15. 

Further, 

there  are 

concurrent 

findings of  both  the  learned  Courts  below 

against 

the  petitioner. 

In  case  of 

concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below, 

scope  of 

the  constitutional  petition 

becomes  very  limited.  The  petitioner  has 

failed to point out any misreading or non-

reading  of  the  evidence.  It  has  been  laid 

down  in  a  case  titled  as  “Syed Arif Ali 

Sabri VS Abdul Samad through L.Rs. 

and 2 others” (2008 YLR 2309)” that: 

 
 
 
 
 
16 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

"When  there  are  concurrent 

findings  of  Courts  below,  the 

scope  of  the  constitutional 

petition for interference is very 

limited  and  it  can  only  be 

interfered when the orders of the 

Courts below are fanciful or based 

on misreading or non-reading of 

the evidence".  The  same  view  has 

also  been  taken  in  a  case  titled  as 

“Sadruddin VS Aslam Madad Ali 

and  others”  (PLD  2008  Karachi 

2005). 

16. 

It  is  well  settled  that  certiorari  is 

only available  to quash  a  decision  for  an 

error  of  law.  It  will  also  be  issued  for 

correcting  errors  of  jurisdiction  when  an 

inferior  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts  without 

jurisdiction or in excess of its jurisdiction, 

or  fails  to  exercise  its  jurisdiction  or 

where  the  Court  or  a  tribunal  acts 

illegally  in  exercise  of  its  undoubted 

jurisdiction  and  it  decides  a  matter  in 

violation  of  the  principle  of  natural 

justice.  The  High  Court  while  issuing  a 

writ  of  certiorari  acts  in  exercise  of 

supervisory 

and 

not 

appellate 

 
 
 
17 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

jurisdiction. The High Court in exercise of 

its  writ  jurisdiction  will  not  review  the 

findings  of  facts  reached  by  the  inferior 

Court  or  a  tribunal.  Reliance  may  be 

made to the following case laws:  

(i)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Amjad 

Khan  VS  Muhammad  Irshad 

(Deceased)  through  LRs, 

(2020 SCMR 2155)",  it  is  held 

by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court 

that: 

 "It  is  by  now  a  settled 

principle  of  law  that  the 

High  Courts  must  not 

exercise 

their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

in order to interfere with 

the discretion exercised by 

lower  courts  unless  the 

same 

suffers 

from 

jurisdictional,  factual  or 

legal  errors.  In  other 

words,  such  interference 

would be justified in cases 

where the impugned order 

has  been  passed  without 

jurisdiction or is based on 

misreading or non-reading 

of  evidence, or is  not  in 

 
 
 
18 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

accordance with the law. If 

none  of  these  errors  is 

present,  the  High  Courts 

must  not  exercise  their 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

to  interfere  with  the 

findings  of  lower  courts 

merely because it reached 

a different conclusion as to 

the  controversy  than  the 

latter.  In  this  regard, 

reference can be made to a 

collective reading of Mst. 

Mobin 

Fatima 

v. 

Muhammad  Yamin  (PLD 

2006 SC 214) and Nadira 

Shahzad  v.  Mubashir 

Ahmad 

(1995  SCMR 

1419)."  

(ii)  In  a  case  titled  as "President 

All 

Pakistan  Women 

Association,  Peshawar  Cantt 

VS  Muhammad  Akbar  Awan 

and others” (2020 SCMR 260), 

it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble  Supreme 

Court that: 

"It is settled law that when 

the  Statute  does  not 

provide the right of appeal 

against certain orders, the 

same cannot be challenged 

 
 
 
19 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

by 

invoking 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court in order 

to gain a similar objective. 

Where  a  Statute  has 

expressly barred a remedy 

which is not available to a 

party under the Statute, it 

cannot be sought indirectly 

by 

resort 

to 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

of the High Court. The High 

Courts 

exercising 

constitutional  jurisdiction 

must  be  fully  cognizant 

and conscious of this Rule 

and strictly adhere to the 

same  in  the  interest  of 

advancing the policy of law 

and delivering expeditious 

justice in accordance with 

the 

law  and 

the 

Constitution. 

Even 

otherwise,  constitutional 

jurisdiction  is  equitable 

and discretionary in nature 

and  should  not  be 

exercised  to  defeat  or 

bypass  the  purpose  of  a 

validly  enacted  statutory 

provision."  

(iii)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Chief 

Executive MEPCO and others 

 
 
 
20 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

VS  Muhammad  Fazil  and 

others” (2019 SCMR 919),  it  is 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"Where  the  Court  or  the 

Tribunal  has  jurisdiction 

and it determines specific 

question of fact or even of 

law,  unless  patent  legal 

defect 

or  material 

irregularity is pointed out, 

such determination cannot 

ordinarily  be  interfered 

with  by  the  High  Court 

while 

exercising 

jurisdiction  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution."  

(iv) 

In 

a 

case 

titled 

as 

"Chairman, 

NAB 

VS 

Muhammad  Usman  and 

others” (PLD 2018 SC 28),  it is 

held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court 

that: 

"The  powers  of  judicial 

review  vested  in  High 

Court under Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  is  no 

doubt a great weapon in 

the 

Judge's 

hands 

 
 
21 

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

however,  the  same  shall 

not be exercised in a case 

where  discretion 

is 

exercised 

by 

the 

subordinate court/Tribunal 

in a fair and just manner 

without  violating  or 

disregarding 

statutory 

provision of law, likely to 

occasion  the  failure  of 

justice.  Ordinarily  such 

extraordinary  jurisdiction 

shall not be exercised at 

random  and  in  routine 

manner”.  The  following 

case law is reproduced for 

the  guidance  of  the 

learned Judges of the High 

Court for future course of 

action:  (i)  Brig.  (Rtd.) 

Imtiaz 

Ahmed 

v. 

Government  of  Pakistan, 

through Secretary, Interior 

Division, Islamabad (1994 

SCMR 2142), (ii) Shahnaz 

Begum  v.  The  Hon'ble

Writ Petition No. 2958 of 2021 

(v)  In  a  case  titled  as  "Shajar 

Islam VS Muhammad Siddique 

and 2 others” (PLD 2007 SC 

45),  it  is  held  by  the  Hon'ble 

Supreme Court that: 

"The High Court in exercise 

of 

its 

constitutional 

jurisdiction 

is 

not 

supposed  to  interfere  in 

the  findings  on  the 

controversial  question  of 

facts  based  on  evidence 

even  if  such  finding  is 

erroneous.  The  scope  of 

the judicial review of the 

High  Court  under  Article 

199 of the Constitution in 

such  cases,  is  limited  to 

the extent of misreading or 

non-reading of evidence or 

if the finding is based on 

no  evidence  which  may 

cause  miscarriage  of 

justice but it is not proper 

for  the  High  Court  to 

disturb the finding of fact 

through  reappraisal  of 

evidence 

in 

writ 

jurisdiction or exercise this 

jurisdiction as a substitute 

of revision or appeal”.

17. 

For what has been discussed above, 

the 

judgment 

and 

decree 

dated 

15.02.2018  passed  by  the  learned  Senior 

Civil  Judge-III  (Guardian  Judge),  West-

Islamabad  as  well  as  Order  dated 

03.07.2021  passed  by 

the 

learned 

Additional  District  Judge,  West-Islamabad 

are  in  accordance  with  law  and  facts  of 

the matter and do not require interference 

by  this  Court.  The  writ  petition  is  not 

maintainable, hence dismissed in limine 

being meritless with no order as to costs.
