The Family Judge (East), Islamabad etc  

S. No. of order 
/ proceedings 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary.  

Date of  
order/ 
Proceedings 
18.02.2016  Mr.  Akmal  Zia  Mehmood  Khokhar  Qadri,  Advocate 

for the petitioner. 

Through the instant petition, the petitioner, 

Mashkoor  Ahmed  Khokhar,  has  impugned  the 

order  dated  26.01.2016,  passed  by  the  learned 

Judge,  Family  Court,  Islamabad,  whereby  an 

amount  of  Rs.2,500/-  per  month  was  fixed  as 

interim  maintenance  for  each  of  the  three  minor 

children  of  the  petitioner  who  are  presently  in 

custody  of  their  mother,  Mst.  Sumaira  Mashkoor 

(respondent No2). 

2. 

The  petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  got 

married  on  27.03.2005.  During  the  wedlock  four 

children  were  born  namely  Faizan  (aged  10), 

Jamal  (aged  7  ½),  Saleem  (aged  5)  and  Pakeeza 

(aged  2  ½).  Faizan  is  in  the  petitioner’s  custody, 

whereas  the  rest  of  the  three  children  are  in  the 

mother’s custody. The petitioner has pronounced 

divorce to respondent No.2.  

3. 

On 23.05.2015, respondent No.2, alongwith 

the  three  minor  children  in  her  custody,  filed  a 

suit  for  recovery  of  maintenance  allowance  and 

recovery of dower and dowry articles against the 

petitioner  before  the 

learned  Judge,  Family 

Court,  Islamabad.  The  petitioner  contested  this 

suit  by  filing  a  written  statement  on  14.11.2015. 

The  learned  Court  on  07.01.2016  framed  issues. 

4. 

On  26.01.2016,  the  learned  Court  after 

hearing  the  arguments  of  the  parties,  and 

bearing  the  financial  needs  of  the  three  minor 

children as well as the income of the petitioner in 

mind,  fixed  Rs.2,500/-  per  month  as 

interim

W.P.No.586 of 2016 

maintenance for each of the three minor children 

with effect from February 2016. Aggrieved by the 

said  order,  the  petitioner  has 

invoked  the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court  under 

Article 199 of the Constitution.  

5. 

Mr.  Akmal  Zia  Mehmood  Khokhar  Qadri, 

learned counsel for the petitioner was of the view 

that  the  amount  fixed  as  interim  maintenance  by 

the learned Judge, Family Court, was exorbitant. 

He  could  not  point  out  any  jurisdictional  error  in 

the impugned order.  

6. 

The 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  had 

passed  the  impugned  order  in  terms  of  the 

provisions  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act, 1964, which was added to the 

West  Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  vide 

Ordinance  No.IV  of  2002.  Under  Section  17-A 

ibid,  a  Family  Court  has  the  jurisdiction  to  pass 

an interim order for maintenance at any stage of 

the proceedings in a suit for maintenance. Where 

such  interim  maintenance  is  fixed,  payment  is 

required  to  be  made  on  the  fourteenth  day  of 

each  month  failing  which  the  Family  Court  is 

empowered  to  strike  off  the  defense  of  the 

defendant  and  decree  the  suit.  The  purpose 

behind the provision of interim maintenance is to 

ensure  that  during  the  pendency  of  the  legal 

proceedings  before  the  learned  Judge,  Family 

Court,  financial  constrains  faced  by  the  minors 

are ameliorated. 

7. 

The  grounds  taken  by  the  petitioner  in  his 

petition  do  not  cause  me  to  interfere  in  the 

impugned order, which is interim in  nature. As it 

is  the  interim  maintenance  amount  of  Rs.2,500/- 

for each of the three minor children is too meager 

given the inflation in this day and age. The written 

statement  filed  by  the  petitioner  before  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  did  not  disclose 

that the petitioner had ever  been  anxious or  had 

made  bonafide  demands  for  the  custody  of  his 

3 

W.P.No.586 of 2016 

minor  children.  The  father  of  these  three  minor 

children  cannot  expect  their  mother  keep  them 

as  well  as  to  pay  all  their  expenses.  Hence,  the 

petitioner  is  under  a  legal  as  well  as  a  moral 

obligation  to  maintain  and  support  his  children, 

more  so  when  they  are  minors.  In  the  case  of 

“Syeda  Farhat  Jehan  VS  Syed  Iqbal  Hussain 

Rizvi”  reported  as  “2010  YLR  3275”  it  has  been 

held  by  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Sindh  that  the 

right  of  maintenance  is  natural  right  of  minor 

children  and  their  father  could  not  be  allowed 

under  any  circumstance  to  be  negligent  about 

the same. Furthermore, it was held that it was the 

legal  and  moral  duty  of  a  father  as  the  natural 

guardian  of  his  minor  children 

to  keep 

maintaining them.  No excuse, big or small could 

absolve  a  father  from  his  duty  of  maintaining  his 

minor  as  guardian  through  the  divine  relation  of 

Almighty Allah.  

8. 

Now,  the 

impugned  order 

is  only  an 

interlocutory  order.  The  maintenance 

fixed 

through such an interim order is only temporary. 

As  and  when,  the  final  order  is  passed  the 

amount fixed by the learned Judge, Family Court, 

may  be  modified  and  revisited 

in  that  the 

quantum  of  maintenance  can  be  increased  or 

decreased  after  appraising,  evaluating  and 

examining  the  evidence  produced  during  the 

trial.  The 

impugned  order  fixing  the 

interim 

maintenance  of  Rs.2,500/-  per  month  for  each 

minor  child of  the petitioner  is not the  kind of an 

order 

that  warrants 

interference 

in 

the 

constitutional  jurisdiction  of  this  Court.  In  the 

cases  of  Munir  Alam  VS  Civil  Judge,  Family 

Court,  Lahore  reported  as  2009  CLC  442,  Abrar 

Hussain.  VS  Mehwish  Rana  reported  as  PLD 

2012  Lahore  420  and    Shahid  Ali  Gil  VS  Mst. 

Ruqayya  Bano  reported  as  2015  MLD  265, 

Hon'ble’  High  Courts  have  dismissed  Writ 

Petitions 

against 

orders 

fixing 

interim 

4 

W.P.No.586 of 2016 

maintenance.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  Ali 

Adnan  Dar  VS  Judge,  Family  Court  reported  as 

PLD  2016  Lahore  873,  the  Hon'ble  Lahore  High 

Court did not entertain a Writ Petition against an 

interim  order  under  Section  17-A  of  the  West 

Pakistan  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  fixing  an 

amount  to  be  paid  as  an  interim  maintenance. 

The  said  judgment  enumerates  guidelines  to  be 

followed 

in  matters 

regarding 

interim 

maintenance.  

9. 

One of the grounds taken by the petitioner 

in  his  writ  petition  is  that  he  is  unemployed  and 

has  no  source  of  income.  By  taking  this  ground 

he has raised a factual dispute, which cannot be 

resolved  without  the  recording  of  evidence.  On 

account  of  this  factual  controversy,  the  instant 

petition is not maintainable.  

10.  Section  14  (3)  of  the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

against  an  interim  order  passed  by  a  Family 

Court.  The filing of Writ Petitions against interim 

orders  passed  by  the  Family  Courts  is  to  be 

discouraged  because  an  aggrieved  party  will 

have  a  right  to  agitate  his  grievance  before  the 

appellate  Court  when  the  interim  order  merges 

into  a  final  order.  The  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  being  a  special  law  barring  a 

right  of  appeal  or  revision  against  an  interim 

maintenance  order,  a  writ  petition  against  an 

order  under  Section  17-A  of  the  said  Act  would 

be  maintainable  only  and  only  if  such  an  interim 

order 

is  coram  non  judice,  wholly  without 

jurisdiction  or  based  on malafides.  The  quantum 

of  the  interim  maintenance  cannot  be  made  a 

ground for invoking the constitutional jurisdiction 

of this Court.  

11.  No  case  has  been  made  out 

for 

interference 

in  Writ  Jurisdiction  with 

the 

impugned order dated 26.01.2016  passed by the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court, 

Islamabad.

Consequently,  the  Writ  Petition  is  dismissed  in 

limine.
