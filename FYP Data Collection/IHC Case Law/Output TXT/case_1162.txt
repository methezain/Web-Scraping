Saleem, Advocates for the petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  petition,  the 

petitioner  has  called  in  question  order  dated 

29.01.2021,  passed  by  learned  Senior  Civil 

Judge-I  /  Judge  Family  Court  (West), 

Islamabad, whereby the interim maintenance 

and  schedule  of  meeting  /  visitation  of  the 

petitioner  with  his  minor  daughter 

/ 

respondent  No.2  has  been  decided  by  the 

learned 

Judge 

Family  Court 

(West), 

Islamabad.  

 2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  the  petitioner  is  a 

resident  of  Dubai  and  travels  from  Dubai  to 

Pakistan  /  Islamabad  to  meet  his  minor 

daughter  and  as  per  schedule  fixed  by 

learned 

Judge 

Family  Court 

(West), 

Islamabad,  it  is  not  possible  to  meet  the 

minor  for  a  very  short  time  and  seeks  that 

the  petitioner  should  be  allowed  to  take  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
minor  for  visitation  without  supervision  of 

her  mother. 

Learned 

counsel 

further 

contends  that  the  petitioner  is  regularly 

paying  maintenance  of  the  minor  daughter 

and  has  not  defaulted  and  it  is  the  vested 

right  of  the  petitioner  to  meet  his  minor 

daughter  according  to  his  free  will  and 

accord,  hence  the  impugned  order  is  not 

tenable under the law and the same is liable 

to be set-aside.

Points  raised,  need  consideration.
