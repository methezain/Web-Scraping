JUDGMENT 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:  Through  the  instant  criminal 

appeal,  the  appellant  has  called  in  question  judgment  of  the  learned 

Judicial  Magistrate 

(East), 

Islamabad,  dated  13.03.2020,  whereby 

respondents  No.2  and  3  have  been  acquitted  of  the  charges  in  case  FIR 

No.277, dated 15.04.2018, under Sections 354, 506(ii) PPC read with Section 

25-D Telegraph Act, P.S. Khanna, Islamabad.  

2. 

Succinctly,  Mst.  Nasira  Bibi  submitted  a  complaint  (Exh.PA)  to 

S.H.O.  P.S.  Khanna,  Islamabad  alleging that on  25.02.2018,  when  she  was 

going to pick her children from school, Rafaquat Taj (Respondent No.2) hit 

her from back with motorcycle and threatened her with life to go with him 

on motorcycle, though the complainant managed to free herself. Later on, 

Mst.  Noreen  Bibi  (Respondent  No.3)  i.e.  sister  of  respondent  No.2, 

arranged 

the  complainant’s  mobile  number 

for  respondent  No.2, 

whereafter  respondent  No.2  kept  on  threatening  the  complainant  of  dire 

consequence if she refuses to have relationship with him. After conversion 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Crl. Appeal No.95/2020 

Page | 2 

of  the  complaint  (Exh.PA)  into  FIR  No.277/2018  (Exh.PC),  respondents 

No.2  &  3  were  indicted  on  24.07.2019,  to  which  they  pleaded  not  guilty 

and claimed trial. The learned trial Court after recording of pro and contra 

evidence  acquitted  respondents  No.2  &  3  of  the  charges  vide  impugned 

judgment dated 13.03.2020. Hence, instant criminal appeal.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  appellant contends  that  the  learned  trial  Court 

has not appreciated the prosecution case in its true perspective and passed 

the impugned judgment without recording any cogent reason on each and 

every  point  of  determination;  that  the  prosecution  has  brought  on  record 

sufficient material against the respondent accused persons but the learned 

trial  Court  overlooked  the  same  while  acquitting  the  accused  persons  of 

the  charges;  that  neither  there  is  any  dishonest  improvement  in  the 

statements  of  prosecution  witnesses  nor  there  is  any  question  of  false 

implication  of  the  respondent  accused  persons,  as  such,  the  learned  trial 

Court has passed the impugned judgment in a slipshod and hasty manner, 

which is liable to be set-aside.  

4. 

Conversely, learned counsel for respondents No.2 & 3 in support of 

the impugned judgment stressed that the entire case is based on malafide 

as the alleged incident had taken place on 25.02.2018, whereas the FIR has 

been  registered  with  considerable  delay  on  15.04.2018,  as  such,  the 

appellant  had  allegedly  received  injuries  through  motorcycle  ridden  by 

respondent No.2 but no medical certificate with respect to such injuries has 

been  brought  on  record;  that  no  independent  witness  has  been  produced 

by the complainant, even the Investigating Officer has not put any effort to 

record  evidence  of  the  people  residing  in  nearby  locality;  that  the 

 
 
 
Crl. Appeal No.95/2020 

Page | 3 

prosecution case as set out is full of doubts and improvements, as such, the 

learned  trial  Court  has  rightly  acquitted  respondents  No.2  &  3  of  the 

charges.  

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused.   

Perusal of record reveals that the appellant has  lodged a complaint 

Exh.PA  to  S.H.O.  P.S.  Khanna,  Islamabad,  which  was  converted  into  FIR 

No.77/2018  (Exh.PC),  with  the  allegations  that  on  25.02.2018,  at  about 

11.45  a.m.,  when  the  appellant  was  going  towards  school  to  pick  her 

children up, respondent No.2 hit the complainant from back side through 

his  motorcycle,  whereupon  she  fell  down  and  received  injuries,  as  such, 

respondent No.2 had also allegedly grabbed her hand and forced her to sit 

on  the  motorcycle,  whereupon  the  appellant  raised  hue  and  cry. 

Respondent  No.2  had  also  allegedly  drawn  a  pistol  and  threatened  the 

appellant  that  he  will  kill  her  and  her  family.  Due  to  hue  and  cry  of 

appellant,  the  people  of  vicinity  gathered  at  spot,  as  a  result  whereof 

respondent No.2 fled away from the scene. As per stance of the appellant 

(PW-1),  she  being  a  serious  patient  of  asthma  went  back  to  her  home 

instead  of  going  towards  the  school,  whereafter  her  mother  had  gone  to 

the  school  to  take  the  children.  On  the  following  day,  Mst.  Noreen  Bibi 

(respondent No.3) i.e. real sister of respondent No.2, visited her house and 

started threatening her on yesterday’s incident. 

7. 

The  appellant  (PW-1)  further  maintained  that  in  the  year  2015,  she 

remained a tenant of respondent No.2 for three months, where respondent 

No.3  had  given  her  some  intoxicant  in  vermicelli  and  respondent  No.2 

taking  advantage  of  such  situation  had  made  some  unethical  videos  and 

 
 
 
Crl. Appeal No.95/2020 

Page | 4 

photographs of the appellant, based on which respondent No.2 compelled 

the appellant to keep illicit relationship with him.  

8. 

The incident alleged by the appellant in the FIR (Exh.PC) is only to 

the  extent  that  when  she  was  threatened  by  respondent  No.2  and  forced 

her to sit on his motorcycle but, surprisingly, the event was not reported to 

the  police  on  the  alleged  day  i.e.  25.02.2018,  rather  it  was  reported  on 

15.04.2018, for which no justified reason has been brought on record by the 

appellant as to why the case was not timely lodged or why the police was 

not  informed,  especially  when  the  Police  Station  was  only  one  kilometer 

away.  Such  delay  on  the  part  of  appellant  raises  a  presumption  of 

consultation,  deliberation  and  motivation  to 

lodge  a  case  against 

respondents  No.2  &  3,  as  such,  the  presumption  of  suspicion  in  the 

prosecution  story  emerges  on  record.  It  is  settled  law  that  in  absence  of 

plausible  explanation  of  delay,  the  prosecution  case  suffers  with  fatal 

defects as held in PLD 2019 SC 64 (Mst. Asia Bibi VS The State). 

9. 

During  the  course  of  cross-examination,  the  appellant  made  the 

following admissions:

10.  Keeping  in  view  the  above  admissions  on  the  part  of  appellant 

(PW-1),  the  entire  prosecution  case  becomes  doubtful,  even  the  story 

narrated  by 

the  appellant  has  been  changed,  which 

is 

full  of 

improvements. It is settled law that the initial version, if improved by any 

witness in the witness box, could not be relied upon as such improvements 

are considered to be made with malafide, which otherwise casts a serious 

doubt  on  the  credibility  of  such  witness.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2008 

SCMR 6 (Akhtar Ali VS The State).  

11. 

The prosecution has produced PW-3 Muhammad Nawaz/ASI being 

Investigating  Officer  of  the  case,  who  has  also  verified  that  the  FIR  has

been  lodged  with  delay  of  one  month  and  25  days  and  the  appellant’s 

father was an ex-police official. He collected the CDR of appellant through 

Exh.PB,  comprising  of  five  pages  (Exh.P1  to  Exh.P5)  as  well  as  of 

respondent  No.2  (comprising  of  Exh.P6  to  Exh.P20).  The  Investigating 

Officer, with respect to the CDR, acknowledged that:

12. 

This  aspect  of  the  matter  primarily  establishes  the  factum  of 

subsistence  of  relationship  between  the  appellant  and  respondent  No.2, 

even  it  has  also  been  confirmed  by  the  Investigating  Officer  that  the 

appellant remained tenant of respondent  No.2. He further confirmed that 

the appellant has not verified  the fact that  on the alleged date of incident 

i.e. 25.02.2018, it was Sunday and the school was off. He confirmed that no 

independent witness was produced in this case to justify the stance of the 

complainant / appellant.  

13.  On  the  other  hand,  respondent  No.2  accused  has  denied  the  entire 

incident  in  his  statement  under  Section  342  Cr.P.C.  and  has  produced 

DW-1 Raja Sajid i.e. owner of Public School near New Shakrial, Zia Masjid, 

in  which  appellant’s  children  were  studying  at  the  relevant  time,  who 

confirmed that on  25.02.2018, the school was off due  to Sunday  and even 

there was no function on said date, neither the children of appellant visited 

the school on said date. Such defence version belies the entire stance of the 

appellant, who has failed to justify her testimony.  

14.  Having regard to the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is confident 

to hold that the entire case is fraught with doubts and the prosecution has 

 
 
 
ت
ت
 
 
 
Crl. Appeal No.95/2020 

Page | 7 

failed to discharge the burden in order to prove the allegations against the 

respondents accused, even there is not an iota of evidence qua the charges 

under  Section  25  of  the  Telegraph  Act,  1885  when  there  is  no  voice 

recording  or  messages  recovered  during  the  investigation,  neither  any 

mobile  phone  of  respondent  No.2  was  taken  into  possession  by  the 

Investigating  Officer.  Keeping  in  view  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the 

case, it can safely be held that the case in hand is based on a spurious story 

and this Court is mindful of the settled principle that even a single doubt is 

enough  to  dispel  the  entire  story  of  the  prosecution,  as  such,  the 

prosecution  case  is  fraught  with  doubts,  therefore,  benefit  of  doubt 

automatically  emerges  in  favour  of  the  respondents  accused,  which  shall 

be  extended  not  as  a  matter  of  grace  but,  as  a  right  without  any 

reservation. Reliance is placed upon 2021 SCMR 873 (The State v. Ahmed 

Omar  Sheikh,  etc.).  Even  otherwise,  the  parameters  to  deal  with  appeal 

against  conviction  and  appeal  against  acquittal  are  different  because 

acquittal carries presumption of double innocence, and, as such, there is no 

perversity in the judgment of acquittal passed by the learned Trial Court, 

which  is  within  four  corners  of  law,  therefore,  instant  appeal  is  meritless 

and the same is hereby DISMISSED.
