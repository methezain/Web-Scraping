12-11-2021.  Mr.  Ali  Waqas  Sheikh,  Advocate  for  the 

petitioner.  

  The petitioner is aggrieved by judgment 

and  decree  dated  07.04.2021  through  which 

maintenance  of 

respondent  No.3,  minor 

daughter  of  the  petitioner,  was  fixed  as 

Rs.15,000/-  and  the  judgment  and  decree  of 

the  learned  Additional  District  Judge  dated 

12.07.2021  pursuant  to  which  the  appeal 

against  said  judgment  and  decree  of  the 

learned Family Court was dismissed.  

2. 

Learned  counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

submitted  that  the  petitioner  was  unwell  at 

the  time  that  the  impugned  judgment  and 

decree  were  passed  by  the  learned  Family 

Court  and  his  counsel  did  not  inform  him 

regarding  the  judgment  and  decree.  That  on 

19.05.2021 

counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

informed  him  via  text  message  that  suit  for 

recovery  of  maintenance  had  been  decreed 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.       W.P No. 4011/2021 

against  him.  The  learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  submitted 

that 

the  period  of 

limitation  had  already  expired  and 

the 

petitioner  subsequently  filed  an  appeal  which 

was also dismissed being time barred.      

3. 

  The  argument  of  the  petitioner  is  that 

the  impugned  judgments  and  decrees  suffer 

from  infirmity  merely  because  the  petitioner 

had sufficient cause for not appearing on the 

date  on  which  the  impugned  judgment  and 

decree  were  passed.  That  it  was  due  to 

negligence  of  his  counsel  that  the  said 

judgment and decree were not brought to the 

attention of the petitioner and this fact of the 

matter  was  not  appreciated  by  the  learned 

appellate  court.  The  submission  of  the 

learned 

counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

is 

misconceived. 

In 

the  event 

that 

the 

petitioner’s  duly  authorized  and  appointed 

counsel  failed  to  appear  before  the  court  on 

the  date  on  which  the  judgment  and  decree 

were passed, the remedy of the petitioner lies 

against  such  counsel  and  burden  of  any 

delinquency  on  part  of  his  counsel  cannot  be 

shifted to respondents No. 3 and 4.  

4. 

  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

has  failed  to  point  out  any  infirmity  either  in 

the  judgment  and  decree  passed  by  the 

 
3.       W.P No. 4011/2021 

learned  Family  Court  pursuant  to  which  the 

maintenance  in  the  amount  of  Rs.15000/- 

has  been  fixed  for  the  petitioner’s  minor 

daughter  nor  has  been  able  to  point  out  any 

infirmity  in  the  Judgment  of  the  learned  

Additional District Judge. The learned counsel 

has  also  not  pointed  out  any  misreading  or 

non-reading  of  evidence  on  part  of  the 

learned  Family  Court  and  has  failed  to 

establish  that  the  amount  of  maintenance 

fixed  by 

the 

learned  Family  Court 

is 

prohibitive in view of means of the petitioner.     

5. 

  For  the  aforesaid  reasons,  this  petition 

is without merit and is dismissed in limine.  

Saeed.
