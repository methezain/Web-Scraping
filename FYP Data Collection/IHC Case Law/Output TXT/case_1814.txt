Through  this CrI. Misc. petition, the petitioner

has applied  for post-arrest  bail in case FIR No.63, dated

22.02.2018,  U /S  302/365/392/  411,/201./  34 PPC, P.S.

2. 

Brief facts  referred in the instant FIR are that

complainant/respondent No'2 Raja Nasir Raza got

lodged  the instant FIR with the allegations that his

cousin Raja Yasir Murtaza,  aged about  35/36  years was

living in Pakistan  Town Phase-I  with his family and on

21,.02.2018,  he left his house  on his vehicle  No.AEG-854

at about 04:00 a.m but did not return and there is

likelihood that he has been kidnapped by unknown

Persons.

3. 

Learned  counsel for the petitioner contends  that

petitioner is wife of missing  Person Raja  Yasir Muttaza

whose dead body was subsequently recovered from

Crl. Misc.  No.421lB/2019

2

Rawal Dam and his missing  vehicle was also recovered

from Rawalpindi;  that present petitioner was nominated

in this case through supplementary  statement dated

01.03.2018 and she was forced to record her statement

U /51,64 Cr.P.C.  after  snatching  her minor suckling child

and as a result  whereof she was allegedly involved

through the said confessional  statement  by the police as

well as by the complainanU  that petitioner is behind  the

bars since 11.03.2018  and trial has not yet been

concluded,  whereby she is claiming  post arrest bail on

merit as well as on the ground  of statutory  delay.

4. 

Conversely,learned  counsel for the complainant

as well as learned State Counsel contend that petitioner

is nominated  through supplementary  statement  and she

has recorded her inculpatory  statement in which  entire

incident of murder  of Raja Yasir has been explained

with the help of co-accused  of the petitioner in a planed

manner;  that the delay in the conclusion  of trial is not

attributed to the prosecution and the trial Court has

already  recorded  evidence of 06 prosecution  witnesses

and there  is likelihood  of conclusion of trial within  next

45 days after  summer  vacations.

5. 

6. 

Arguments  heard, record perused.

From the tentative assessment of record, it

reveals that petitioner  has been nominated in criminal

case  FIR  No.63, dated  22.02.2018,  U /S

302/365/392/411,/201,/34 PPC, P.S. Lohi  Bher,

Islamabad  through supplementary statement  recorded

Crl. Misc.  No.42UBl2019

3

on 01.03.2018. The petitioner is wife of deceased  Raja

Yasir Murtaza who was murdered  by co-accused

nominated in this case, however,  petitioner /wife of

deceased  got recorded  her confessional statement U/S

164 Cr.P.C.  in which she has explained  the relationship

with co-accused Shahid, with whom  she has allegedly

planned the murder of deceased.

7. 

Cursory  glimpse of record  reveals that co-

accused Shahid  and Waseem visited the house of

petitioner  in  the late night with  pre-planned

arrangement  and they  kidnaPPed  Raja  Yasir Murtaza  on

gunpoint and took him on his own vehicle  and later on

committed  murder in a brutal  manner. This entire story

was narrated  by the petitioner/accused before the

Magistrate.

8. 

Challan  was submitted in  the Court on

06.06.2018, charged  was framed on 03-07.2018 and at

present  six prosecution  witnesses have recorded their

statements. The record of trial Court reveals that trial is

proceeding  on fast track. The Power of attorney on

behalf of petitioner was submitted in the trial Court  on

06.09.2018,  where-after 58 dates of hearing have been

fixed  before the trial Court,  whereas  the Presiding

Officer was on leave on 07 dates of hearing,  05
adjournments were granted  due to strike of Bar

Association  and 08 adjournments  were granted  due to

absence  of prosecution  witnesses. Even otherwise,  the

case has been fixed for 09 dates of hearing  in the month

Crl. Misc.  No.421lB/2019

4

of luly,  2019, for 06 dates of hearing in the month of

June, 2019 and for 07 times in the month  of May,2019

before the learned trial Cour! which clearly spells out

that the trial Court is proceeding  with the case in fast

track manner.

9. 

Keeping in  view the above background,

petitioner is tentatively  linked with the hideous  crime of

murder of her own husband  with the help of co-accused

andprima-facie  she is involved in the alleged  murder.  No

malafide or ill will has been established on record

against prosecution witnesses for false implication  of

petitioner in this case  and no ground  of further inquiry

exists in favour of petitioner. The evidentiary  value of

statement U/S  1,64 Cr.P.C.  will be assessed during the

course of trial which is at the verge of conclusion,

therefore, any benefit of grant of post arrest bail on

merit is not made out.

10.  The petitioner  is a woman  having suckling child

in jail, however,  in the peculiar circumstances  while

considering  the background of the case, role of

petitioner in the commission of murder of deceased

clearly  amounts to facilitating the commission  of

offence. The statement of  the petitioner  is  self

inculpatory  and in such circumstances  the bail has been

denied. Reliance is placed  upon 2012 MLD L894 (lmran

Alias  Sunnu VS State),20L 8 MDL 1"319 (Umar Zeb VS

State\.

11,.  Although,  the petitioner  is claiming  post-arrest

Crl. Misc.  No.421lB/2019

5

bail on the ground of statutory delay but in present

circumstances  the trial is likely to be concluded  within

next 45 days as it is going  on fast track, even learned

counsel for complainant  as well as learned State

Counsel stated  before the Court  that they will facilitate

for early conclusion of the trial and some adjournments

have been taken by the petitioner  herself,  which  is

contributory  factor in the delay of the trial. In such type

of eventuality the principle  has been laid down in 2016

SCMR  1538 Babar Hussain  VS State),2011  SCMR1332

(Rehmat  Ullah V"  The State anil another\, PLD 1968

SC 353 (Riasat  AliVS GhulamMuhammail\

12.  As such benefit  of fourth  proviso  in this case  is

not made out, therefore, while considering  the peculiar

circumstances  of the case, instant  bail petition  is hereby

dismissed  and learned  trial Court seized  with the matter

is directed to conclude the trial within next two months

under intimation to this Court.
