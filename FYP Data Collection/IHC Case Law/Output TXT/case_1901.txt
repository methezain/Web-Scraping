IUDGMENT

MOHSIN AKHTAR  KAYANI, I:- Through the instant  civil revision

the petitioner has assailed the judgment dated 30.06.201,4  passed  by learned

Additional District Judge (East) Islamabad.

2. 

Brief facts of the instant case Ere that the petitioner  / AzraGulzar  and

respondent  No.l/Muhammad Farooq  are real sister and brother while the

petitioner  through her pleadings claims that she is the owner  of Plot No.140,

situated at Margallah Town, Phase-II,  Islamabad  (hcreinafter  "tlv Plot')

which  was transferred in the name of respondent  No.L, however

respondent  No.1 had issued a general power of attorney in favour of

petitioner and it was agreed that the Plot would be transferred  in the name

of petitioner  being the real owner, though,  when petitioner  requested

respondent  No. 1 to transfer  the said plot in her n.une, he, by refusing to

transfer  the same, cancelled  the general power of attorney.  This quandary

emerged  multiple  litigations  between the parties, however the parties in a

suit for specific performance  titled "Muhammad  ]aved VSAzra GuLzar

and others" entered into a compromise Exh.P3  before the Court due to

which all the litigations were withdrawn.  Whereas, respondent  No.1 got

C.R.  No.210/2014

I2l

recorded his statement to the extent  that the Plot  belongs  to petitioner and

he returned the same as well as he is bound to record  his statement  before

the Capital Development Authority,  however he refused  to acknowledge

the same afterward, upon which petitioner filed a fresh suit for specific

performance  of the statement  dated  06.10.2W4 got recorded by respondent

No.1. The suit was contested  by respondent No.1  and after recording  of pro

and contra evidence  of the parties the suit was decreed by the learned Trial

Court,  however  the first Appellate  Court dismissed  the plaint  and reversed

the decree. Hence,  the instant Civil Revision has been filed against the

reverse  findings.

3. 

Learned  counsel for petitioner  contends  that the first Appellate  Court

has not considered the evidence  in its true perspective,  rather  achieved  the

findings  by interpreting  the Section  2f3 of. the Specific Relief  Act, 1877

(hereinaftcr  "the Act") and also given the interpretation  of the compromise

whereby  the learned  Appellate  Court  declared  that the suit titled

"Mulummnd  laoed oersus Azra Perueen" is collusive  and the statement  got

recorded by respondent  No.1 on 05.10.2005  in favour  of petitioner does  not

amount  to perform a contract referred as Exh.P3  and declared  the Issue

No.1 in negative  and dismissed the suit and set aside the decree passed  by

the learned trial Court. Learned  counsel for petitioner further  contends  that

the leamed  Appellate Court has ignored the proved and admitted facts on

record i.e. the admission of execution  of a compromise deed and that  a

statement  recorded before the learned trial Court in suit titled "Muhammad

Jaaed t)ersus Azra  Gulzay''  f.all, within the ambit  of Section 12(1) of the Act and

there is no bar for the specific performance of a compromise  deed  in terms

of Section 213 of. the Act.

4.  Conversely,  learned counsel  for respondent No.1 contended that the

learned trial Court  has not appreciated the evidence  in its true perspective

C.R.  No. n0/2f14

t3I

and the first Appellate Court has rightly  passed the decree in accordance

with law; that the petitioner in her plaint  referred the cause of action

accrued  to her on72.71,.2004, whereas  the alleged statement  on the basis  of

which the petitioner  filed a suit for specific performance  was recorded  on

05.10.2005  and it is not possible  that cause  of action accrued earlier on the

basis of subsequent  acU that the statement  got recorded before the learned

trial Court in suit titled "Muhammad  Jroed  oersus Azra Gulzar" does not

amount  to agreement  and the same could not be enforced through  specific

performance;  that statement  got recorded  by respondent  No.1 before  the

learned  Civil Court while  entering into a compromise Exh.P3  is based  upon

duress and coercion  and the same  is not enforceable in terms of Section

28(1) of the Act.

5.  Arguments  heard,  record  perused.

6. 

From the perusal  of record  it has been  observed that Azra  Gulzar/

petitioner,  wife of Mian Gulzar  Hussain,  is the real sister  of Muhammad

Farooq/respondent  No.1,  who filed a suit for specific  performance  of the

statement recorded  by respondent  No.1  before  the learned  Civil ]udge  in

civil suit titled "Mulummad laoed uersus Azra Gulzal' and the same  was

contested  by respondent  No.1 mainly  on the ground that the statement  got

recorded  by him is based  upon fraud,  misrepresentation and under  coercive

measures  and  has no legal  effect upon his rights.  It has further  been  pleaded

by respondent  No.1 that he has neither entered in an agreement  with

petitioner  nor received  any sale consideration  regarding  the #fidavit  and

statement  dated 06.10.2005  recorded in the Court of Mr. Amir  Saleem  Rana,

Civil )udge, Islamabad.

7.  The brief history  illustrated from the available  record is that

petitioner claims that she purchased  the Plot after paying the sale

C.R.  No.zt0/2U14

14I

consideration  and she is a Parda-Nashin lady, who  got transferred  the Plot

in the narne of her real brother i.e. respondent No.1, who executed  an

irrevocable  power of attorney in her favour.  Subsequently, due to certain

domestic  disputes amongst  the parties,  respondent  No.1 cancelled the

power of attorney which resulted into initiation of multiple  litigatiora.  It

has further  been observed from the record that the Plot was sold to one

Muhammad  Javed by AzraGulzar, who filed a suit titled "Muhammad laoed

uersus  Azra Gulzar  and Mulummad  Farooq"  before  the learned  Civil Court,

Islamabad, however  the parties  i.e. Azra Gulzar and Muhammad  Farooq,,

entered into a compromise during  the proceedings,  resultantly,  compromise

deed  Exh.P3  was executed,  wherein  different  cases have been referred

therein and parties  have given a specific undertaking  that they will

withdraw their civil and criminal litigations. However,  it is necessary  to

reproduce  the content of the relevant portion in order to understand the

real controversy and for the same purpose,  a pretext is hereby  reproduced:

8.  The abovementioned  qualified  admissions available  on record have

been  reiterated  by respondent No.L in his testimony  as DW-1, however  the

main  issue  raised  in this case through the divergent  pleadings of the parties

is whether  the statement  recorded as Exh.P3  and Exh.PS is the result of

fraud, misrepresentatiory  duress  and coercion. However, it is necessary to

discuss  the evidence given by respondent  No.L so to understand  the true

perspective of the case. Essentially, respondent  No.1 got recorded  his

C.R.  No. 2I:0/2074

tn

detailed version as DW-1 whereby he contended  that he was living  with

petitioner in the year  2004 and he never sold the Plot to petitioner and that

he winded  up his business as the same was taken over by one Muhammad

Gulzar after handing over him a cheque of Rs.1,000,000/- which was

dishonored  and respectively  an FIR No.359/20M  was registered, however

on the basis of trust he handed over a general power of attorney  to

petitioner  as he was leaving for his hometown Okara  from Islamabad. He

further stated  before the Court  that CDA issued  a letter of confirmation  to

him that he had not confirmed and subsequently he cancelled  the general

power of attorney  that was given  to petitioner  referred as Exh.Dl under

objection.  However,  he further  stated that Azra Gulzar,  her husband Gulzar

Hussain and Muhammad laved, in connivance with each  other  prepared  a

forged  agreement  in back date i.e. 26.08.2004  and a civil suit tilted

"Mulwmmad Farooq nersus  Azra Gulzar and otlurs"  was filed and obtained  a

stafus  quo order. Furthermore, the said agreement was never  registered

with any stamp vendor nor even  having any record with notary public,

even the sale consideration  of Rs.2,000,000/-  was never given. However,  he

has produced  the copy of the issues regarding  the forged  agreement framed

in that suit, referred as Exh.D2. He further contends that Gulzar Hussain

artd Azra Gulzar managed different  criminal cases  against him, including

FIR No.331/2005  Exh.D3, Suit No.17l2005, Suit No.81/2004,  Suit

No.82l20M,  Suit No.83/20M,  Suit No.15/2005  and Challan  of FIR

No.t14/2005,  referred  as Exh.D4  to Exh.D9.  He also produced  a copy of

Qalandara  dated 05.05.2005. He further  contends that Exh.PS and  Exh.P3

dated  06.10.2005  were executed  against  his wishes  as threats  were extended

to him that if he will not enter into a compromise  he will be arrested and

involved in different  criminal and civil proceedings. He also asserted that

petitioner and her husband Gulzar Hussain appeared  in trial of FIR

C.R.  No. no/2o14

t8I

No.44/2004  on 07.07.2006  before the Court  of Mr. Sarwar Saleemulllah,

learned Additional  Session |udge,  Lahore and got recorded her

statement  as PW-3 and she stated  before the Court that the Plot was

owned by Muhammad  Farooq. Lastly, he stated that the statement

recorded  and affidavit sworn on 05.10.2005  before  Mr. Amir Saleem

Rana, Civil Judge,  Islamabad  were obtained under  duress  and

coercion.

9.  During the course of cross-examinatiory  Muhammad  Farooq as

DW-1  admitted the followingfacts:

Similarly, during  the course of cross-examination  a question has specifically

been asked  by the petitioner side,  referred as:

The above referred question and answer  clearly demonstrate  that

Muhammad Farooq/DW-7  has not responded  the question in its true

perspective rather given a weak answer  but execution  of Exh.P3  was

admitted  by him. However,  he further conceded that:

10.  In view of above referred position,  the main issue which  revolves

around the entire pleadings is Issue No.1 as to whether the plaintiff  is

entifled  for the decree for specific performance of the contract as prayed for.

Whereas,  it is evident  from the available  record discussed  above and the

evidence  given by Muhammad Farooq/respondent No.1, that he admitted

the following factors:

a) Plot 140,  Margallah  Town, Phase-II,  measuring 200 sq yards is in his

nEune.

b) Given a general power  of attorney in favour of Azra Gulzar regarding

the Plot which was registered  and submiffed  in the CDA.

c) The power of attorney was cancelled by Muhammad  Farooq  and this

fact was also referred in the written  statement  that, 'tlu CDA  oide  letter

dated  1-6.06.2004  asl<ed  the answeing defendant  for confirmation  of said Wlt)er

of attorney.  As the address  of tlu answering  defendnnt  was  that  of tlu plaintiff

in tlu offirkl record therefore tlu same was dioerted by tlu plaintiff to tlw

answeing defendant."

C.R.  No. 2rO/2A14

110I

This means that the bona  fide of petitioner is apparent  and she herself send

the letter  to respondent  No.1 regarding confirmation.  However,  there  are

some key factors being admitted  by respondent  No.1, such  as:

(i)  DW-l/Muhammad  Farooq executed Exh.P3 and admifted his

signature  Exh.re/1,, this means that the compromise  agreement  has

been acknowledged  and the terms referred in the agreement  i.e

(ii)  Exh.PS has been admitted and its execution  was also admitted as

Exh.P5/1 by Muhammad  Farooq/Dw-l.  The fragment  of which is

(i")  This very fact acknowledges  that original allohnent  and title record is

available  with Azra Gulzar.

(")  Muhammad  Farooq  also  acknowledged  the statement  recorded  by

him before  the Civil Court referred as Exh.P6 in order  sheet dated

06.10.2005 recorded by Mr. Amir Saleem Rana, Civil |udge,

Islamabad  whereby  he stated that:

77.  Despite the above referred qualified  admissions, there  is no chance

left to assume  that all these  statements,  which were recorded  by learned

Civil Judge in presence of the learned counsel  for the parties, including  the

learned  counsel for respondent No.1,  were recorded  under duress and

coercion.  It has further  been observed from the record that respondent  No.L,

despite his plea that he lvas under duress  and coercion and the other side

had managed the compromise  deed Exh.tl3 and Exh.PS  through

misrepresentation and fraud, never  raised  any such question independently

through  any civil or criminal proceedings nor filed any application before

any competent authority  for denial of his statement  except when  the instant

suit was filed by Azra Gulzx, only then he has taken the stance  in his

written  statement but the entire evidence  clearly demonstrates that he has

not brought  any circumstances  on record  through  which it can be proved

that he was under duress and coercion, especially when nine other cases

referred in Exh.tl3  have been withdrawn  by Gulzat Hussain  and even the

criminal  case, which he referred as "The  State  oersus  Muh.ammad  Yousaf

registered  as Case No.4fr.005"  \Mas also settled between the parties  and not a

single criminal or civil suit is in the field rather all have been withdrawn.

Hence, it can safely be concluded  that Azra Galzar, the petitioner, and her

husband Mian Gulzar  Hussain have complied with the terms of agreement

and respondent No.1 has taken a blated plea in order  to deprive  them from

their rights.

12.  The above  details of the suit persuaded  this Court to dilate upon the

issue of Section 12 of. the Act whereas the law on the subject clearly

demonstrates  that when, "act agreed  to be done is in the performance,

wholly or partly, of a trusU"  such kind of agreements  can be specifically

C.R.  No. n0/201,4

1121

performed  and enforceable under law, however respondent side has taken  a

plea that when any agreement has been executed under duress and

coerciorL the same cannot  be performed  or enforced.  In order  to dilate upon

the issue, Section  28 of the Act has been reproduced  as under:

"28. Srycific performancc  of a contract  cannot be enforced against
apar$  tlureto in any of tlu following  cases:-
a) if tlrc consideration  to be reehted by him is so grossly
inndcquate,  with  reference  to tlu state of things  existing at tle
date of the contract, as to be eitlur by itself or coupled utith
other circumstances eaidence of fraud or of undue adoantage
takenby  tlu plaintiff;

b) if his assent  was obtained by the misrepresentation  (wlutlur
willful or innocent), concealment, circumoention  or unfair
practices,  of any party  to wlam ryrformance  wouldbecome  due
undcr tlu contract, orby  apromise  of suchpflrty  whichhas  not
been  sub stantinlly  fulfille d;

c) if his assent  was grotn under tlu influencc  of mistal<e of fact,
misayprelunsion  or surprise: Prooided that, wlun  tlu contract
proaides for compensation in case of mistalce,  compensation
may be made for a mistal<e  within  the scope  of such prooision,
and tlu contract may be specifically enforced in otlur  respects
if proper to be  so enforced."

13.  The above  referred provisions of the Act clearly  provides an

exception  regarding the performance  of any agreement, especially  when

any assent  was obtained by misrepresentation  or concealment,  however

from the detailed evidence  of the parties it  has been observed  that

respondent No.1 while appearing as DW-1 has only reiterated his own

stance that he was compelled  under duress and coercion  while recording  of

Exh.P3  and Exh.PS but he has never produced  any independent  witness to

substantiate  this very claim nor he ever filed any application  before  the

leamed  trial Court to deny his statement  Exh.P6 recorded before Mr. Amir

Saleem Rana, Civil Judge,  Islamabad.

74.  It is settled proposition  of law that compromise  between the parties

can be equated  to a valid contract and breach whereof  would  give rise to a

C.R.  No. n0/201,4

fresh  cause of action, reliance is placed  upon  2009 SCMR7268  (PeerDil  os.

Dail Muhammaill.  It is also settled  law that a breach of a contract  to

transfer  immovable  property cannot be adequately relieved  by

compensation  in money, although  the matter has been referred in Exh.P3

that in case, parties have not complied with the terms,  a compensation  of

Rs.3,000,000/-  will be paid but the most important factor which is

apparent that Azta Gulzar and Mian Gulzar Hussain  have withdrawn all

the criminal  and civil cases and the only statement  which  is referred  by

respondent  No.1 is that he has acknowledged  the status  of. Azra Gulzar as

the absolute  owner of the Plot and he has returned the same to

Azra Gulzar,  therefore, in my estimatiory  the agreement Exh.P3 has duly

been performed therein then and nothing  has been left. However,  there is

an exception  if Azra Gulzar or Mian Gulzar Hussain refuse  to withdraw

any civil suit, then respondent  No.L could claim the compensation  but in

present case, the original  document of the title of the Plot was already in

possession of. Azra Gulzar  which  has been acknowledged by respondent

No.L in his written statement and even he has not given any justification

as to what kind of threats  he was receiving while recording  his statement

of a compromise.

15.  Additionally,  it is also settled  proposition  of law that agreement

recorded  by Court of law is a valid agreement and the undertaking given

during  the pendency  of a suit has a binding effect, reliance  in this regard

is respectively placed upon  2009 YLR 705 (Abilul Latif os. Mehboob

Alam\ and PLI 2008 Pesh 777 (Mst. Nusrat  Begum  os. Muhammail  lqbal

76.  It has further  been  observed from different pronouncements  of the

superior Courts that consideration  is the factor through  which an

agreement  has to be proved and in this case, both the parties are closely

related to each other and they have settled their consideration  for

withdrawal  of their cases against  each other in order to reconcile  and

settle  the family  disputes.  All these  factors  are apparent from Exh.P3,

however  there  is no bar that consideration  may be moved from a third

parf as referred in AIR 7939 Patna 477 (Raia Shiba Prassad Sinilh os.

Tincouri Banerii  and anothei. The ingredients  of the valid contract  are

offer & acceptance and consideration  & enforceability, whereas  in

present case, parties have entered  into a compromise  including the

statement  got recorded  by respondent  No.L before the Court of law and  a

written representation  referred as Exh.P3 and Exh.PS, wherein  he

categorically admitted  that the Plot belongs to Azra Gulzar  and he has no

claim whatsoever  against  the said Plot, therefore,  there is no need of

signatures  of  Azra Gulzar on the said document as her husband

Mian Gulzar Hussair; who is party in 9 other cases with Muhammad

Farooq and his family members,  is there to sign and as it is admitted

between the parties that Azra Gulzar  is a Parda  Nashin lady, in such

evenfuality signatures of the parties is not necessary  f.or a valid contract

and offer & acceptance  could also be employed  from the conduct  of the

parties. Reliance in  this regard is  placed  upon 2077 SCMR 98

(Muhammad Sattar os. Tariq faoaid\.

17.  It is surfaced from record  that respondent  No.1 has never  filed any

application  against the orders passed by Mr. Amir Saleem Rana,

C.R.  No. n0/2o74

Civil |udge, Islamabad,  where the statement of respondent  No.1 was

recorded  and placed upon record  as Exh.P6, therefore,  the presumption  of

truth is always  attached  to the judicial proceedings,  especially  when the

same has not been denied and acknowledged by respondent  No.1.

Reliance  is placed upon 2002 SCMR 7336  (Muhammail Ramzan  os. Lahore

Deoelopment  Authoityt and 2004 SCMR 964(Eaygaz  Hussain os. Akbar

Hussainl.

18.  In view of above referred factors  and overwhelming evidence

which  leans in favour of petitioner,  it further proves that the plot in

question  was transferred in the name of respondent  No.1 by petitioner

and respondent No.L has returned  the same as he stated before the Court

as well as in the agreement  and also  acknowledges  its execution before

the Court, however respondent  No.1 has not produced any witness to

deny the execution  of the contractf  agreement  Exh.P3  and Exh.PS and

even for that matter the proceedings  before the Court, Exh.P6

19.  I have gone through  the judgment  passed by the learned  Appellate

Court,  whereby  the learned  Appellate  Court while ignoring  the qualified

admissions  of respondent  No.1, also ignored  Exh.P3,  Exh.PS and Exh.P5,

which are the key documents  though  the same were duly acknowledged  by

respondent  No.1 in his testimony. However, the learned Appellate  Court

while addressing the issue in a very precise manner, referred  details in the

Para-15 of the impugned judgment, which for illustration is hereby

produced  as under:

'L5. Furthermore, the appellant  recorded  the statement  dated
06.70.2005  in a suit titled  " M. laaaid...os,...Azra  Gulzar"  . The
subject suit lt)ns instituted on the pretext  that Jaoaid is
purchaser of the alleged plot from Azra Gulzar.  Howetser, after
recording his statement  by appellant instead to proceed  with
the decree of suit in his faoour  he rather  opted  to withdraw the
suit, therefore,  laoaid  withdraw  the suit does not tantamount
to performance to a contract allegedly- entered  aide  n

C.R. No.2l0/2o14

116I

compromise deed Ex.P3. Since it is nowhere mentioned that
laaaid in pursuance of a compromise  deed Ex.P3  between
appellant  and respondent  No.1  husband  had withdrawn  the
suit and if it is admitted that laoed had withdralon  the suit on
the pretext of compromise  deed of appellant and her husband
than, it means  Jaaed  brought  collusioe  suit, with respondent
No.L in order to get faoourable statement dated 06.L0.2005
from  appellant in faaour of respondent  No.l-,  therefore, issue
No.I ls answered in negatioe.  Both of the parties had addressed
their arguments to the extent of issue No.1, therefore there is
no need  to address the rest of the issues,  eaen otherwise, in tht
light of the discussion  on issue NoJ. rest of the issues  are
become  redundant."

The above referred  reasons  rendered by the learned Appellate Court are

hypothetical in nature whereas no such evidence was ever brought  on

record  and the learned Appellate  Court has ignored the fact that the

sanctity attached to the iudicial  proceedings are much higher than the

statement of an individual wherein the presumption of truth is always

attached to judicial proceedings  as held in 2004 SCMR  964 (Eayyaz

Hussain  os. Akbar Hussain\, but plea taken by the learned Appellate

Court is not reflective from the record  as there is no independent

evidence of collusiveness  rather the plea taken by respondent  No.1  has

not been  proved independently  as he is bound to prove the issue of

duress, coercion,  misrepresentation or fraud but he has not requested the

learned  Trial Court for summoning  of Muhammad  ]aved in the Court so

to thrash  the issue in such a manner, therefore, the verdict  given  by the

first Appellate  Court in Para-15 of the impugned  judgment is contrary  to

law and facts of the case as learned  Appellate Court has not discussed

the evidence in its true perspective and has not considered the wisdom

referred  in Section 28 oL the Act as there  is no duress/coercion  available

on record.

20.  The powers conferred  U/S  115 CPC has been  invoked in this case,

whereas the same is based upon  the following two separate  conditionalities:

C.R.  No. n0/2o1,4

a. The case  has been decided, by the subordinate  Court  and no appeal

should  lie.

b. After fulfillment of above  condition  the Revisional  Court has to see

as to whether  the subordinate  Court has exercised the jurisdiction

not vested  in it, or failed to exercise  jurisdiction  vested  in it or acted

in exercise  of its jurisdiction  illegally or with material  irregularity.

By application of the abovementioned  principles,  the order  passed by the

Appellate  Court where it has been declared that, 'Jaoed brought collusiae  suit,

with respondent  No.1 in order to get fruourable statement  dated  06.L0.2005  fronr

appellant  in fooour of respndent No.l."  is not sustainable  in the eye of law,

whereas this Court comes  to a conclusion  that it is not based uPon any

evidence rather  the Court has assumed this very fact without any basis and

reversed  the findings  in appellate  jurisdiction, whereas  it is the duty of the

Revisional  Court in terms  of Sec.  115 CPC that any findings which  are perverse

in law or misreading  of evidence was found, shows illegalrty with material

irregularity as referred  above  and in such  eventuality the order passed by the

Court, which  has based its judgment  and decree  on such assumed facts,  has

exercised the jurisdiction  not vested in it and has given  the findings  contrary  to

the record, hence  the same amounts to an illegal  exercise  of jurisdiction.

21.  It is settled  proposition of law that in case of conflicts  of learned  Trial

Court and Appellate Court, the decision of first Appellate Court  was to be

preferred in revisional jurisdiction.  Reliance  is placed  upon 7999 CLC 372

Karachi (llm-ud-Din as. Syed Satfraz Hussain\  and 2008 YLR 798 Lahore

(Kaneez Bibi os. Muhammad Ashra|l.  But the preference of the appellate

judgment  of the Appellate Court  would  only be sustainable if the same is

not in violation  of principles  of administration of justice  or was not arbitrary

or fanciful,  where  such  qualifications  arc appffent on record  the judgment

C.R.  No.210/2014

118l

of the Appellate Court should not be considered, whereas this Court is of

the view that Appellate Court has based  its findings in the impugned

judgment on the basis  of material  irregularity  and exercised the jurisdiction

not vested in it and given the same  without any basis while assuming  the

facts which were not on record,  whereas the golden principle  of violation  of

principles  of administration  of justice demands  that such illegal  exercise

could  have been rectified by the Revisional  Court. In this regard, I am

fortified by the judgment and principles laid down in 2008 WR 67 Lahore

(Abilul Maieeil  os. Amiail Farooq\ PLD  7970 Supreme  Court 739 $hahzaila

Muhammad Umar Baig os. Sultan  Mehmood Khanr. 2000 CLC 500 Ouetta

(Aasa os. Ibrahiml  au.ld  PLD 7996 Karachi  202 (Mir Muhammail alias Miral

os, GhulamMuhammadl.

22.  In view of above  reasons,  the learned Appellate Court  has exercised

the jurisdiction  not vested  in it and figured the entire findings of Para-l5  on

hypothetical  assumption  which  is actually  based on no-evidence,  therefore,

the jurisdiction vested  in the learned  Appellate  Court has not been  exercised

diligenfly, hence,  the impugned judgment  and decree dated 30.06.201.4

passed  by learned Additional District Judge  (East) Islamabad is hereby set

aside and the decree passed  by the learned trial Court  is hereby restored.
