Date of Hearing:

15.07.2022. 

Through the instant writ petition, the Petitioner 

has  assailed  the Judgment and Decree dated 31.03.2022  (“Impugned Judgment and 

Decree”)  passed  by 

the 

learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad  (East) 

(“Appellate  Court”),  whereby  appeal  filed  by  the  Respondents  No.  3  to  6  was 

partially accepted. The Petitioner further seeks restoration of the Judgment and Decree 

dated  02.02.2022,  passed  by  the  learned  Senior  Civil  Judge/Judge  Family-Guardian 

Court, East, Islamabad (“Trial Court”).  

2. 

The  facts  as  per  the  Memo  of  Petition  are  that  the  Petitioner  married  to 

Respondent  No.3  on  06.05.2011  and  the  couple  had  three  children  i.e.  Respondents 

No. 4 to 6.  On 10.05.2019, the Respondent No.3 left the house of the Petitioner taking 

away  the  Petitioner’s  gold  ornaments  and  precious  belongings.  The  Petitioner  filed  a 

suit  for  conjugal  rights  and also a petition for guardianship, whereas, the Respondents 

No. 3 to 6 filed a separate suit for recovery of maintenance against the Petitioner. After 

recording  evidence  and  hearing  the  arguments  submitted  by  the  parties  the  learned 

Trial Court passed a consolidated  Judgment and Decree dated 02.02.2022 in the three 

suits  whereby  decree  for  restitution  of  conjugal  rights  was  passed  in  favour  of  the 

Petitioner;  the  suit  of  the  Respondents  No.  3  to  6  was  partially  decreed  accordingly 

Respondent No.3 was held entitled to maintenance allowance at the rate of Rs. 5,000/- 

per month from the date of joining the Petitioner as spouse and the Respondents No. 3 

to 6 were allowed maintenance at the rate of Rs. 3,500/- per month each; whereas the 

Petitioner’s petition for custody was dismissed albeit  visitation  rights  were granted.  

3. 

The Respondents No. 3 to 6 filed an appeal before the learned Appellate Court 

which  was  partially  decreed  vide  the  Impugned  Judgment  and  Decree  whereby  the 

Respondents No. 3 to 6 were held entitled to maintenance at the rate of Rs. 7,000/- per 

month each with 10% annual increase. Hence, present petition. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 

The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  stated  that  the  Petitioner  is  a 

government  primary  teacher  having  meager  income  whereas  the  parents  of  the 

Petitioner are of old age and suffering from different chronic diseases therefore learned 

Appellate  Court  has  passed  the  Impugned  Judgment  and  Decree without applying the 

judicial  mind.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  also  produced  before  this  Court 

the Petitioner’s salary slip for the month of June, 2022, Family Registration Certificate 

showing his parents and medical bill dated 24.03.2021 in respect of Petitioner’s father. 

The  learned  counsel  relied  upon  Tauqeer  Ahmad  Qureshi  VS Additional District 

Judge,  Lahore  and  others,  PLD  2009  SC  760,  Abdul  Jabbar  VS Additional 

District  Judge,  2009  CLC  364,  Muhammad  Aslam  VSMuhammad Usman, 2004 

CLC  473,  M.  Saleem  Ahmad  Siddqui  VS Sabira  Begum,  2001  YLR  2329,  M. 

Shazia  VS M.  Nasir,  2014  YLR  1563,  Shahid  Raza  VS Dr.  Fauzia  Shaheen, 

2004  MLD  1325,  Manzoor  Ahmed  VS District  Officer  Revenue,  Lahore,  2006 

CLC 1647, and Mazhar Iqbal VS D.C.O. Toba Tek Singh, 2008 SCMR 863.  

5. 

On the other hand the learned counsel for the Respondents submitted that the 

writ  petition  should  not  be  indulged  as  the  Petitioner  has  till  date  paid  only  Rs. 

30,000/- towards the maintenance while execution proceedings are pending. He further 

highlighted that it is an admitted fact that the Petitioner’s father is a retired service man 

who  owns  a  house  at  Alipur  Farash,  Islamabad  and  as  such  is  not  dependent  on  the 

Petitioner; and that the Petitioner is school teacher of BPS-14 who has admitted in his 

examination in chief that he  has abundant resources for raising the children as such the 

petition  is  without  any  merit  and  is  liable  to  be  dismissed.  The  learned  counsel  in 

support of his contentions relied on Tanveer Salamat VSAdditional District Judge 

and  others,  2019 YLR 1862, Talha Asif Taufiz VSVth Additional District Judge 

and others, 2016 MLD 742 (Sindh). 

6. 

I  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  parties  and  have  also  perused  the 

available  record.  

7. 

 It  has  to  be  borne  in  mind  that  this  Court  in  exercise  of  Constitutional 

jurisdiction  does  not  act  like  a  Court  of  appeal.    As  such,  the  Court  cannot  embark 

upon  a  reappraisal  of  evidence.    The  Honourable  Supreme  Court  in  the  case  of 

Muhammad Hafeez VS District Judge Karachi East, 2008 SCMR 398 held that in the 

event  of  conflict  of  judgments,  findings  of  the  Appellate  Court  is to be preferred and 

 
 
 
 
respected  unless  it  is  shown  from  the  record  that  such  findings  are  not  supported  by 

evidence  or  that  conclusions  drawn  are  against  the  material  on  record  or  that  the 

judgment  of  the  Appellate  Court  suffers  from  misreading  or  non-reading  of  the 

evidence  or  that  the  reasons  recorded  for  reversal  of  judgment  are  arbitrary,  fanciful 

and perverse.   

8. 

The learned counsel for the Petitioner is unable to point out any non-reading or 

misreading  of  evidence  or  any  other  illegality  or  infirmity  in  the  Impugned  Judgment 

and  Decree.  Therefore,  I  am  not  compelled  to  exercise  the  discretionary  jurisdiction 

under  Article  199  of  the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 to disturb 

the findings  recorded by the learned Appellate  Court. 

9. 

The  documents  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the  Petitioner  during 

arguments before this Court cannot be taken into consideration at this stage as the same 

were  not  produced  for  evidence  before  the  learned  Family  Court  for  reasons  best 

known to the Petitioner.  

10. 

In  view  of  the  foregoing,  no  reasonable  grounds  have  been  made  out  for 

interference  with  the  findings  of  the  learned  Appellate  Court  in  exercise  of  writ 

jurisdiction.   As such, the instant petition is dismissed as being devoid of merit.
