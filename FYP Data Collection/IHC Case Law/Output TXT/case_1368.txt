JUDGMENT 

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:-  Through  this  writ  petition,  the 

petitioners  have  prayed  for  quashing  of  FIR  No.394,  dated  26.11.2019, 

under Sections 420, 468, 471 PPC, P.S. Shalimar, Islamabad.  

2. 

Succinctly,  petitioners  namely  Malik  Sair-ur-Rehman  and  Malik 

Abid-ur-Rehman  (petitioners)  being  owners  of  Commercial  Plot No.11-A, 

measuring  900  sq.  yds.,  F-10  Markaz,  Islamabad  have  constructed 

Emporium  Mall,  in  which  Faisal  Naeem  Khan  (Respondent  No.1)  had 

entered into agreement to sell with the petitioners with respect to purchase 

of a shop i.e. P-18 at 5th Floor, against sale consideration of Rs.66,000,000/-, 

as  such,  respondent  No.1  learnt  that  5th  Floor  of  said  plaza  has  illegally 

been constructed by the petitioners in violation of conditions settled by the 

CDA.  Accordingly,  on  the  complaint  filed  by  respondent  No.1  the 

 
 
 
 
 
 
W.P. No.4153 of 2019  

        Page 2 

aforesaid FIR No.394/2019 has been lodged against the petitioners. Hence, 

instant writ petition.  

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  petitioners  contends  that  registration  of  the 

instant  FIR  is  against  the  law  as  the  matter  arises  out  from  contractual 

obligations,  which  could  only  be  settled  by  the  Civil  Court  having 

competent jurisdiction, per se, the learned trial Court has overlooked this 

aspect of the matter that the dispute between the parties is purely of civil 

nature;  that  non-compliance  of  the  agreement  to  sell  does  not  constitute 

any offence, as such, the agreement executed between the parties already 

contains  arbitration  clause;  that  respondent  No.1  could  not  claim 

possession  of  the  disputed  shops  until  total  sale  consideration  is  paid  in 

full;  that  petitioners  have  been  involved  in  the  instant  FIR  with  malafide 

intention and ulterior motives to pressurize the petitioners.  

4. 

Conversely,  learned  State  Counsel  as  well  as  learned  counsel  for 

respondent No.1 contend that petitioners in violation of settled terms and 

conditions  have  constructed  5th  Floor  and  knowingly  offered  public  at 

large  to  invest  their  hard  earned  money  in  the  project;  that  contents  of 

complaint  /  FIR  shows  commission  of  cognizable  offence  by  the 

petitioners as respondent No.1 as well as others have been defrauded, per 

se, the matter could not be resolved without recording of evidence.  

5. 

6. 

Arguments heard, record perused.   

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  the  petitioners  have  been  nominated 

as  accused  persons  in  case  FIR  No.394,  dated  26.11.2019,  under  Sections 

 
 
W.P. No.4153 of 2019  

        Page 3 

420,  468,  471  PPC,  P.S.  Shalimar,  Islamabad,  lodged  on  the  complaint  of 

Faisal Naeem Khan / Respondent No.1.  

7. 

The  petitioners  have  been  allotted  Commercial  Plot  No.11-A, 

measuring 900 sq. yards, F-10 Markaz, Islamabad, by the CDA vide letter 

dated 02.04.2013, over which they have constructed a plaza by the name of 

Emporium  Mall.  Respondent  No.1  has  lodged  the  FIR  alleging  that  the 

petitioners  have  sold  him  a  shop  situated  at  5th  Floor,  against  total 

consideration  of  Rs.66,000,000/-,  however  the  petitioners  have  failed  to 

deliver possession of said shop within the stipulated period. On inquiry, it 

revealed  to  respondent  No.1  that  the  CDA  declared  the  construction  of 

Emporium  Mall  as  illegal  because  of  construction  of  two illegal  floors  i.e. 

5th and 6th, as a result whereof, respondent No.1 has been deprived of his 

hard earned money.  

8. 

Learned  counsel  for  petitioners  contends  that  the  disputed  floors 

have been demolished by the petitioners and allotment with respect to said 

mall  has  been  restored  by  the  Estate  Management  Directorate-II  of  CDA 

vide letters dated 22.10.2020 and 04.12.2020.  

9. 

I  have  confronted  learned  counsel  for  petitioners  as  to  whether  the 

FIR could be quashed when a fraud has  admittedly been committed with 

the complainant qua the shop not permitted to be constructed at 5th and 6th 

floor  or  even  sold?  Whereby, learned  counsel  for  petitioner  in  categorical 

terms contends that they have provided alternate shops at lower floors to 

respondent  No.1  and  the  matter  has  been  resolved  to  that  extent  but,  at 

 
 
W.P. No.4153 of 2019  

        Page 4 

this  stage,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.1  has  denied  any  such 

settlement.  

10. 

In  view  of  above  reason,  this  Court  is  convinced  that,  prima  facie, 

allegation  requires  recording  of  evidence  as  it  could  not  be  resolved  in 

these summary proceedings of quashing of FIR.  

11. 

This Court is also mindful of the fact that the principle governing the 

exercise of powers available under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. could only be put 

into effect when no offence is made out from bare reading of the FIR or the 

charges appear to be  groundless  or the dispute  is of  a civil nature, which 

has  been  converted  into  criminal  proceedings  with  malafide  intention. 

Reliance  is  placed  upon  2014  YLR  429  Karachi  (Bashir  Ahmed  v.  Family 

Judge,  Karachi),  2014  MLD  795  Peshawar  (Aftab  Ahmad  VS  The  State), 

2016  P.Cr.LJ  1144  G.B.  Chief  Court  (Faisal  Iqbal  VS  The  State),  2016 

P.Cr.LJ  305  Karachi  (Muhammad  Aslam  VS  SECP)  and  2015  P.Cr.LJ  576 

Islamabad (Muhammad Zubair v. Senior Superintendent of Police). 

12. 

Likewise, alternate remedies  under Sections 249-A or 265-K  Cr.P.C. 

are  available  to  the  petitioners,  who  can  invoke  the  jurisdiction  of  the 

learned  Trial  Court  at  appropriate  stage  when  some  evidence  has  been 

recorded in due course of time.  Per se, the High Court could not exercise 

the  jurisdiction  under  Section  561-A  Cr.P.C.  as  held  in  case  reported  as 

PLD 2017 Islamabad 64 (Ali Raza v. Federation of Pakistan). 

13. 

The  petitioners  have  failed  to  demonstrate  any  exceptional  or 

extraordinary  circumstance 

in 

this  case 

for  exercise  of 

inherent 

powers under Section 561-A Cr.P.C., which is the key factor for quashing 

 
 
W.P. No.4153 of 2019  

        Page 5 

of  FIR.  Reliance  is  placed  upon  2008  SCMR  76  (Dr.  Ghulam  Mustafa  VS 

The  State),  2011  SCMR  1937  (Rana  Shahid  Ahmad  Khan  VS  Tanveer 

Ahmad)  and  PLD  2007  SC  48  (The  State  through  Prosecutor  General, 

Lahore v. Sultan Ahmed).  

14. 

In view of above, instant writ petition is not  made  out  and same  is 

hereby  DISMISSED.  The  learned  Additional  Sessions  Judge  seized  with 

the  pre-arrest  bail  of  petitioners  is  directed  to  decide  the  said  application 

within the period of 15 days, under intimation to this Court.
