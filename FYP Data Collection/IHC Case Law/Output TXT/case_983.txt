Order with signature of Judge and that of parties 
or counsel where necessary.  

Rao Sabir Hussain, Advocate for applicant/petitioner. 

Through  the  instant  C.M.,  the  applicant  has 

prayed  for  restoration  of  main  writ  petition,  which  was 

dismissed for non-prosecution on 22.06.2021. 

2.   

Learned counsel for the applicant contends that 

he  or  his  client/applicant/petitioner  was  not  aware  about 

the  date  of  hearing  i.e.  22.06.2021,  as  a  result  whereof, 

the  petition  was  dismissed  for  non-prosecution  and  as 

such  the  absence  of  applicant/petitioner  was  neither 

deliberate  nor  intentional.  In  support  of  the  above 

contention  personal  affidavit  of  the  learned  counsel  for 

the applicant is appended with the instant C.M. 

3.   

No  one  is  in  attendance  on  behalf  of  the 

respondent  No.3  despite  her  service  to  rebut  this  factual 

aspect,  hence,  instant  C.M.  is  allowed  and  Writ  Petition 

No. 2566/2019 stands restored to its original number. 

4.   

Office  is  directed  to  issue  fresh  notice  to 

respondent  No.3/Rubab  Khan  for  17.12.2021,  through 

learned  Senior  Civil  Judge,  Sargodha,  at  the  expense  of 

the applicant/petitioner.
