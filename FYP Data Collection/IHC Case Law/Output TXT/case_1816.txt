Date of order/
Proceedings
01.08.2019 Ms. Farzana  Faisal Khan, Advocate for the petitioner.

Order  with signature  of Judge  and that  of parties or counsel
where  necessary.

Through  the instant writ petition, the petiUoner,
Muhammad Asad Hanif, impugns  the order dated
15.07.2019, whereby the learned  Civil Court struck off
the petitioner's  right to file the written statement.

The order sheet  of the said case reveals  that the
learned  Civil Gourt had directed  the petitioner to submit
his written statement  on 29.06.2019.  The petitioner
neither submitted  the written statement  on the said date
nor on 15.07.2019.  This default  on the petitioner's part
caused the learned Civil Court to strike off his right  to file
a written statement. Since the petitioner had not
complied with the direction of the learned Civil Court  to
file a written statement, the learned  Civil Court was
justified  in striking off his right  to file a written statement.
However,  learned counsel for  the  contesting
respondents submitted  that the petiUoner may be
permitted to file a written statement subject to payment
of costs and provided  that he does not prolong  the
proceedings  before the learned Civil Court.

ln view of the said concession,  the instant petition
is allowed, and the impugned  order  dated 15.07.2019  to
the extent  of striking  off the petitioner's  right to file a
written statement  is set-aside  subject to the payment of
cost to the tune of Rs.20,000/-  to the contesting
respondent  on the next date of hearing before the
learned Civil Court. There  shall be no order  as to costs.
