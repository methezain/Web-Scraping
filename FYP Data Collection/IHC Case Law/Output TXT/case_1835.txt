(f)  Those who have been paid

This Para-3 does not  deprive the
petitioners of their right to obtain a plot,
The word 'affedee'  has been defined  in
Islamabad  Displaced  Persons
Rehabilitation  Policy,  7984, as follows:-
"Affectee" means a  person or
persons  whose  agricultural  land
and/or  built-up propefi  is
acquired under  the  CDA
Ordinance.  .
Para-4 of  the  Policy relates to
"Affectees"  due to acquisition of Built-
up propefi only and para (b) deals with
"Affectees"  due to acquisition of land or
land and built-up propefi.

than 4 kanals, or land and built -up
properU is acquired  and the acquired
anea is less than  4O kanals of culturable
land but more than 4 kanals the affectee

land lost in acquisition  is 4O kanals or
more,"
Under this policy, the petitioners  are
entitled to  the allotment  of  plots
according to the categories shown  in
sub-para 7  to  5  of  Para-&, Some
departure has been made from the
earlier policy in Islamabad  Displaced
Persons Rehabilitation Policy, 7996, xxx
this policy is  not applicable to  the
petitionerc,  The  petitioners had
acquired a vested right under the policy
letter dated 3.7,7982  and the CDA
Rehabilitation Policy, 7984, Under
Article 24 of the Islamic Republic  of
Pakistan, 7973, no  person can be
deprived of the propefty save by the
authority of law which provides for
compensation  or specified  the principles
on and the manner  in  which the
compensation is to be determined and
given. The policy letter dated 3.7,7982
and the Rehabilitation Policy provides
the guidelines in detail for award of
compensation  . The petitioners  cannot
be  deprived of  the  same,  The
rehabilitation policy has been  framed
under the CDA Ordinance, 796O, and
has the force of law, Reference  may be
made to PLD 7975 Lahore 445.
4,  For what has been stated above,
the respondent authority  is directed  to
consider  the case of the petitioners in
accordance  with the afore-mentioned
policy within three months  positively,
No  discrimination  against  the
petitioners shall be  made in  any
respect,"
In the impugned  judgment,  the learned
Division Bench of the High Couft  had
dealt with the matter as Under:-
While  taking  into
"7, 
consideration all 
attending
circumstances  of  the case, we
have also gone through the
impugned judgment wherein the
learned Single Judge in Chambers
obserued that respondents are
entitled to the allotment of plots
under rehabilitation  Policy, 7984
and since the acquisition  was
made under the said policy,
subsequently  policy of 7996 is not
applicable to  the case of  the
present  respondents. Above all,
through  the impugned order, the
appellant CDA was directed only
to  consider the  case of  the
respondents in  accordance with
the rehabilitation  Policy,  7984
within three months positively
with fufther direction that no
discrimination shall be made in

tl

any respect  with the respondents,
Record speaks  of the fad that the
appellant has not  yet  finally
decided the  claim  of 
the
respondents,  who are waiting for
their decision since the year 7994
i,e, for more than fifteen years."
It  is an admitted fad that the
8, 
respondents  are residing in Dhokes and
their agricultural  land and built-up
propefty were  acquired by  the
petitioner-CDA,  therefore, they  are
entitled to  be  compensated  in
accordance  with Policy lefter dated
03,07.7982 read with relevant pottion
of the Policy of  7984 issued by the
petitioner-CDA.
9.  We  are,  therefore, of 
the
considered  opinion that the impugned
judgment and the iudgment of  the
learned  single  Judge 
are
unexceptionable  and no interterence  is
called from  this  Court. We are,
therefore,  not inclined to grant leave to
appeal, consequently, this  petition
stands  dismissed".

6.  The bare perusal of the above judgment

shows that the august Apex Court held that the

affectees of the agricultural land acquired  by

Capital  Development  Authority  are entitled to
be compensated in accordance with policy

letter dated 03.01.1982. The petitioner,  who

claims to be an affectee is also entitled to be

compensated, if his credentials  are verified and

he is eligible for the same.
7.  The instant petition is disposed  of in

terms of the observation made by the august
Apex Court in the abovementioned  case

provided  he is entitled to be compensated  in

accordance  with the relevant  criteria.
