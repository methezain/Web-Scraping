Mr.  Riffat  Hussain  Malik,  Advocate  for  the 
respondent No. 1. 
Petitioner in person. 
Respondent No.1 in person. 

Petitioner  has 

invoked 

the  writ 

jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of 

the  Constitution  of  Islamic  Republic  of 

Pakistan, 1973 with the following prayer; 

“It is, therefore, humbly prayed 

and  requested  that  impugned 

order  being 

illegal  and 

unlawfully, is to be set aside and 

cancelled  and  called  the minor 

along with respondent No. 1 and 

decide the writ on merits, in the 

interest of justice, good conscious 

and equity”. 

02.  Succinctly stated facts of the case are 

that,  marriage  of 

the  petitioner  and 

responding No. 1 was solemnized according 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 

Writ Petition No. 1639 of 2021 

to  Muslim  rights  and  ceremonies,  in  the 

year  2011.  From  the  wedlock,  a  daughter 

was  born  in  the  year  2013.  Thereafter, 

relationship  between  the  husband  and  wife 

has become strain and the petitioner thrown 

respondent  No.  1  out  of  his  house  about  2 

½  years  back.  Respondent  No.  1  /  mother 

is  living  with  her  parents,  the  minor  / 

daughter  was  also  living  with  her  mother. 

Allegedly  the  petitioner  snatched  the  minor 

daughter  from  her mother. In  consequence 

whereof, respondent No. 1 filed the petition 

under  Section 

491  Cr.P.C. 

Learned 

Additional  Sessions  Judge-West,  Islamabad 

vide  impugned  order  dated  26.04.2021 

handed over custody of the minor daughter 

/ detenue to respondent No 1 / real mother 

and  the  parties  were  advised  to  approach 

the  Guardian  Court  having  competent 

jurisdiction to regulate custody of the minor. 

03.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

inter alia contends that the impugned order 

has  been  passed  without  touching  the 

merits  of  the  case; 

learned  Additional 

Sessions 

Judge-West, 

Islamabad 

has 

 
 
3 

Writ Petition No. 1639 of 2021 

illegally  handed  over  custody  of  the  minor 

to  respondent  No.  1  /  mother;  learned 

Additional Sessions Judge has gone beyond 

its jurisdiction and forcibly handed over the 

minor  /  daughter  to  her  mother  without 

considering  wishes  of  the  minor,  who  is 

capable of understanding nature of act and 

the impugned order is not a speaking order, 

hence liable to be set aside.  

04.  Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 

has  controverted  the  arguments  advanced 

by  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and 

has  stated  that  the  impugned  order  has 

been passed in accordance with law; as the 

petitioner  has  contracted  second  marriage 

and  the  minor  is  aged  about  8  years, 

therefore, her welfare lies with the mother, 

so custody of the minor was rightly handed 

over to the respondent No. 1 / mother.  

05.  Arguments  of  learned  counsel  for  the 

parties  have  been  heard  and  record  has 

been perused with their able assistance. 

06. 

It is admitted that the petitioner after 

contracting 

the 

first  marriage  with 

respondent  No.  1  in  the  year  2011,  has 

 
 
4 

Writ Petition No. 1639 of 2021 

contracted the second Nikkah in Multan and 

again  contracted  the  third  marriage  on 

20.01.2016, whereas respondent No. 1 after 

the  marriage  with  petitioner  has  not 

contracted  any  marriage.  The  minor  / 

daughter  namely  Ibbah  Zeeshan,  whose 

date  of  birth  is  16.08.2013  aged  about  8 

years)  is  living  with  her  mother  and  her 

school  certificate  shows  that  she  is  getting 

education  in  Bint-e-Hawa  Girls  School  of 

Education,  Islamabad.  Mother  /  respondent 

No.  1  is  bearing  all  expenses  of  her 

daughter  /  minor.  The  marriage  between 

the  parties  is  still  intact  but  not  even  a 

single  penny  in  lieu  of  maintenance  has 

been paid by the petitioner, to the minor or 

her  mother.  According  to  law,  custody  of 

the  minor  is  to  be  regulated  by  the 

Guardian  Court  having 

the  competent 

jurisdiction,  so  the  impugned  order  dated 

26.04.2021 has rightly been passed. 

07.  Learned counsel for the petitioner has 

made no submission on the point as to how 

the  impugned  order  is  not  in  consonance 

with law or without jurisdiction or in excess 

 
 
5 

Writ Petition No. 1639 of 2021 

of jurisdiction. 

08.  The 

learned  Additional  Sessions 

Judge-West,  Islamabad  has  only  granted 

temporary  custody  of  minor  to  respondent 

No.  1  directing  the  parties  to  approach 

proper  forum  regarding  proper  custody  of 

minor.  Moreover,  there  is  also  no  extra 

ordinary  or 

real  urgency  warranting 

interference by this Court.    

09. 

In view of above prospect, instant writ 

petition  has  no  merit  and  same  is  hereby 

dismissed.
