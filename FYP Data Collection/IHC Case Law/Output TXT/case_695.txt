Zunaira Malik and others  

S. No. of order/ 
proceedings 

Date of  order/ 
proceedings 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary.  

               (1)                  14.02.2022.  Mr.  Sadiq  Mobin  Khan,  Advocate  for  the 
Petitioner.   

Through  instant  petition,  the  Petitioner  has 

assailed  Order  dated  19.01.2022  (“Impugned 

Order”)  passed  by  the  learned  Judge  Family 

Court-West, 

Islamabad,  whereby, 

interim 

maintenance  allowance  at  the  rate  of  Rs.40,000/- 

per month has been fixed for Respondents No.2. 

2. 

Facts, in brief, are that the Petitioner and the 

Respondent  No.1  were  married  on  25.01.2020 

against  the  dower  amount  of  Rs.  10,000/-  which 

was  paid  at  that  time.    The  parties  were  blessed 

with  one  daughter 

i.e.  Respondent  No.  2.  

Respondents  No.1  &  2  filed  suit  for  Recovery  of 

Maintenance  for  the  minor/Respondent  No.  2  on 

16.09.2021  on  the  allegation  that  the  Petitioner  is 

not  paying  for  the  monthly  expenditure  of  the 

minor/Respondent No.2.  

3. 

The  learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  West-

Islamabad,  vide  the  Impugned  Order  fixed  the 

interim monthly maintenance of Respondent No. 2 

as aforesaid to be paid w.e.f  filling of the suit for 

recovery of maintenance till its final decision. The 

 
 
 
 
2|W.P No. 465/2022 

Petitioner  has  assailed  the  order  through  instant 

petition.  

4. 

Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted 

that the learned Trial Court has not considered and 

appreciated  the  financial  status  of  the  Petitioner 

and  the  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  on  the 

basis  of  misreading  and  non-reading  of 

the 

record/pleadings;  that  Respondent  No.  1  failed  to 

attach  any  documentary  evidence  of  Petitioner’s 

source  of  income;  that  ailing  parents  of  the 

Petitioner are economically, medically and socially 

dependent  on  him  and  as  such  has  prayed  for 

setting aside of the Impugned Order.  

5. 

The  Impugned  Order  has  been  passed  in 

pursuance  of  Section  17-A  of  the  West  Pakistan 

Family Courts Act, 1964, where under the Family 

Court has the jurisdiction to pass interim order for 

maintenance  at  any  stage  of  the  proceedings  in  a 

suit  for  maintenance.  The  purpose  behind  the 

provision of interim maintenance is to ensure that 

during  the  pendency  of  the  legal  proceedings,  the 

minors are not faced with financial challenges. 

6. 

Section 14  (3) of the  West  Pakistan  Family 

Courts  Act,  1964,  bars  an  appeal  or  revision 

against an interim order passed by a Family Court 

with the obvious purpose to avoid delays.  

7. 

The 

Impugned  Order 

is  merely  an 

interlocutory order. The maintenance fixed through 

such  an  order  is  only  temporary.  The  quantum  of 

maintenance may be modified after appraising the 

evidence produced at trial. An aggrieved party will 

have  a  right  to  agitate  his  grievance  before  the 

appellate Court when the interim order merges into 

 
3|W.P No. 465/2022 

a  final order. Even otherwise,  quantum of  interim 

maintenance,  being  a  factual  dispute  cannot  be 

made  a  ground  for  invoking  the  Constitutional 

jurisdiction of this Court.  

8. 

I am guided by the consistent view taken by 

different  Honorable  Benches  of  the  Islamabad 

High  Court, 

Islamabad 

in  various  matters 

including 

the  reported  cases  of  Dr.  Aqueel 

Waris VSIbrahim  Aqueel  Waris,  2020  CLC 

131;  [      ],  2018  CLC  506;  Mashkoor  Ahmed 

Khokhar VSThe  Family 

Judge 

(East), 

Islamabad,  2019  CLC  1635;  Muhammad 

Touseeq  Danial  Bhatti VSAyesha  Naeem, 

2021  MLD 

337; 

and  Aamir  Munir 

Puri VSMst.  Saima  Naeem,  2021  YLR  2166, 

wherein  it  has  been  held  that  interlocutory  orders 

by 

the  Family  Court  cannot  be  assailed  in 

Constitutional  jurisdiction  even  though  they  may 

be harsh in some instances. The instant petition is, 

therefore, not maintainable. 

9. 

Thus,  in  the  light  of  above  said  discussion 

and  keeping  in  view  the  above  said  observations 

by  this  Court  in  the  aforementioned  cases  the 

Impugned  Order  dated  19.01.2022  passed  by  the 

learned  Judge,  Family  Court,  West-Islamabad, 

does  not  call  for  interference  in  writ  jurisdiction.  

Consequently, 

this  Writ  Petition 

is  hereby 

dismissed in limine.
