Date of  order/ 
Proceedings 

Order with signature of Judge and that of parties or 
counsel where necessary. 

       06.         08.11.2021.  Mr. Tariq Mehmood Mughal, Advocate for  

petitioner. 
Mr. Mazhar Iqbal, Advocate for  
respondent No.3. 

The  basic  contention  of  the  learned 

counsel 

for 

the  petitioner 

is 

that 

the 

respondent  was  declared  disobedient  wife  by 

the  learned  trial  Court  and  that  a  disobedient 

wife  is  not  entitled  to  be  maintained  by  the 

husband  when  she  is  living  in  her  parentâ€™s 

house. Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks 

some  time  to  assist  the  Court  as  to  test  laid 

down  by 

the  superior  Courts 

regarding 

declaration  of  a  wife  as  disobedient  wife,  and 

further  the  rights  of  a  wife  under  the  Muslim 

Family Law Ordinance including any finding  by 

the  Superior  Courts  that  a  wife  being  to  be 

disobedient  is  not  entitled  to  the  rights  she  is 

otherwise  entitled to during the  subsistence of 

marriage.
