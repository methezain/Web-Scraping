JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT.

W.P. No. 4397/2019

Dr. Aqueel Waris

VS

Ibrahim Aqueel Waris, etc.

Petitioner by:

Mr. Muhammad Farhan, Advocate.

Respondents by: Mr. Saqib Hanif Janjua, Advocate.

Date of Decision: 13.12.2021.

MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J: Through  this writ  petition,  the

petitioner has assailed the judgment & decree dated 17.07.2019, passed by

learned  Judge  Family  Court,  Islamabad  and  judgment  & decree  dated

12.10.2019,  passed  by  learned  Additional  District  Judge,  Islamabad,

whereby appeal has been dismissed.

2.

Brief  facts  referred  in  the  instant  writ  petition  are  that  respondent

No.1 Ibrahim Aqueel Waris alongwith her mother Dr. Maryam Khan filed

suit  for  maintenance  against  the  petitioner  before  learned  Judge  Family

Court  (East),  Islamabad  on  the  basis  of  nikkah-nama  executed  between

petitioner  and  respondent  No.2  on  07.12.2012,  which  was  dissolved  vide

judgment  &  decree  dated  20.02.2018,  passed  by  Judge  Family  Court.

During  the  subsistence  of  marriage,  respondent  No.1  was  born  on

01.01.2014  whose  maintenance  has  been  claimed  from  the  petitioner.  The

suit was contested by the petitioner with the ground that he is not working

as Registrar in Ireland and is getting the salary of 2496.92 euro and his net

W.P. No.4397/2019

salary  is  1555.90  euro,  which  is  equal  to  PKR.2,11,480/- out  of  which  he

has  to  bear  the  cost  of  living  and  is  also  sending  money  to  family  and

parents though he has not denied the maintenance. Learned Judge Family

Court  after  considering  the  evidence  of  the  parties  has  passed  the

judgment  &  decree  which  has  been  maintained  by  the  appellate  court.

Hence, instant writ petition.

3.

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contends  that  both  the  courts

below have not appreciated the hardships faced by the petitioner as he has

also  entered  into  second  marriage  after  the  dissolution  of  first  marriage

and he has placed his pay slip on record; that court has fixed the high rate

of  maintenance  for  the  minor  which  is  required  to  be  reduced  in  the

circumstances.

4.

Conversely, 

learned  counsel 

for  respondents  contends 

that

petitioner  has  not  pointed  out  any  illegality  in  the  concurrent  findings

except  he  is  praying  for  reduction  in  maintenance  though  he  is  living  in

Ireland  and  working  as  doctor  with  salary  of  66,193/- euro  per  year  as

reflected  from  his  pay  slip  Ex.D-1,  dated  14.06.2018,  which  is  three  years

old and as such at present the rate of pay has been changed  which  is not

available  on  record;  that  petitioner  has  not  yet  cleared  previous

maintenance accumulated  against  him  and  as  such  he  is  not  entitled  for

discretionary relief at this stage.

5.

6.

Arguments heard, record perused.

Perusal of record reveals that petitioner was married to respondent

No.2  Dr.  Maryam Khan  vide  nikkah-nama  dated  07.12.2012  and  later  on

marriage was dissolved by the Judge Family Court on the basis of suit for

dissolution of marriage filed by respondent No.2 vide judgment & decree

W.P. No.4397/2019

dated 20.02.2018. However, respondent No.2 has claimed the maintenance

of  her  minor  son  born  on  01.01.2014,  which  is  presently  in  custody  of

respondent  No.2.  Both  the  courts  below  have  passed  the  concurrent

judgments by considering the status of petitioner, who is living in Ireland

and  working  as  Surgeon  in  the hospital  as  reflected  from  his  pay  slip

Ex.D1, dated 14.06.2018, issued by Health Services Executive in which he is

getting salary of 66193.17 euro per year and as such his average income per

month is 500/- euro, which factum has not been denied by the petitioner.

As  such  it  is  the  responsibility  of  petitioner  being  father  to  look-after  the

affairs of his real son though the petitioner is still working in Ireland and

has family to look-after but respondent No.1 is his real son who is required

to  be  look-after  by  him  under  the  law.  Even  otherwise,  pay  slip  Ex.D1

brought by the petitioner himself is for the year 2018 and after the elapse of

three  years  his  salary  structure  and  other  benefits  may  also  have  been

raised  though  no  formal  proof  is  available  on  record,  nor  his  counsel  is

able to prove contrary to this aspect.

7.

I have gone through the concurrent findings of the courts below qua

the issue No.1, as such both the courts below have rightly appreciated the

rate of maintenance while considering the inflation and needs of minor. In

such  scenario,  factual  aspect  of  determination  of  rate  of  maintenance  on

the  basis  of  financial  status  of  petitioner/father  could  not  be reviewed

under judicial review in terms of Article 199 of the Constitution of Islamic

Republic of Pakistan, 1973 as  the constitutional jurisdiction could only be

exercised, if any fundamental right  of petitioner has been violated or  any

judgment  or  order  passed  without  jurisdiction  which  is  not  the  case  in

hand.

8.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has not pointed out any illegality

in  the  concurrent  findings,  even  both  the  judgments  are  considered  to  be

within four corners  of law where factual aspect has reasonably and fairly

been considered by the trial court as well as by the appellate court. Even it

is not the case of petitioner that his own evidence has not been appreciated

on  the  touch  stone  of  law  especially  when  he  himself  has  taken  a  fair

stance  through  Ex.D1  and  acknowledges  that  he  is  earning  handsome

amount though he has other family responsibilities but he could not deny

the  responsibility  of  respondent  No.1,  his  real  son,  who  is  taken care  by

respondent No.2 single handedly.

9.

In view of above, instant writ petition is misconceived and the same

is hereby dismissed.
