The  learned  proxy  counsel  requests  for  an

 It is noted that copy of C.M. No. 4483/2022 

was  provided  to  the  learned  counsel  for  the 

Respondents  No.  1  and  2  on  06.12.2022  who 

sought  time  to  go  through  the  same    to  assist  the 

Court  as 

to  whether  or  not 

the  arrears  of 

maintenance  have  been  paid  up  to  date  by  the 

Petitioner  as  this  Court  by  way  of  the  previous 

order  dated  25.11.2022  had  made    this  Writ 

Petition conditional upon whether the Petitioner is 

abiding by the Impugned Judgment and Decree to 

the  extent  of  payment  of  maintenance  which  has 

not  been  challenged  through  the  instant  Writ 

Petition.  The Impugned Judgment and Decree has 

only  been  challenged  to  the  extent  of  dower 

amount which the Petitioner claims was waived off 

by the Respondent No. 1.

The 

learned  counsel  for 

the  Petitioner 

further 

submits 

that  execution  proceedings 

regarding  dower  amount  are  underway  and  the 

next  date  before  the  learned  Executing  Court  is 

 
 
 
 
 
fixed  on  03.03.2023.  He 

requests 

that 

the 

execution proceedings may be suspended.  

4. 

In view of the fact that on the last two dates 

the matter has not been proceeded with on account 

of  the  Respondentsâ€™  side,  therefore,    request  for 

adjournment  is  allowed  however  the  execution 

proceedings  to  the  extent  of  dower  amount  are 

suspended.  

5. 

Relist.
