Date of  order/ 
Proceedings 

Order  with  signature  of  Judge  and  that  of  parties  or  counsel 
where necessary.  

20.04.2021  Mr.  Rana  Ghulam  Rasool,  Advocate 

for 

the 

petitioner.  

Through 

the 

instant  writ  petition, 

the 

petitioner, Jamal Khan Durrani, impugns the order 

dated  07.01.2021,  passed  by  the  learned  Judge 

Family  Court, 

Islamabad-West,  dismissing 

the 

petitioner’s  review  application  against  the  order 

dated 08.10.2020. Vide the order dated 08.10.2020, 

the  respondent  was  held  entitled  for  grant  of 

interim monthly maintenance allowance at the rate 

of Rs.20,000/- from the petitioner. 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submits 

that the petitioner is working overseas as a labour; 

that  respondent  filed  a  suit  for  restitution  of 

conjugal  rights  and  recovery  of  maintenance;  that 

vide  the  impugned  orders,  the  learned  Judge 

Family Court has fixed interim maintenance, which 

is beyond the petitioner’s paying capacity; that the 

petitioner  wants  to  live  with  the  respondent;  that 

the  respondent  is  a  disobedient  wife;  that  no 

maintenance  can  be  awarded  to  a  disobedient 

wife;  and  that  the  impugned  orders  have  been 

passed  without  application  of 

judicial  mind. 

Learned  Counsel  for  the  petitioner  prayed  for  the 

writ  petition  to  be  allowed  and  for  the  impugned 

orders  dated  07.01.2021  and  08.10.2020  to  be  set 

aside. 

3. 

I  have  heard  the  contentions  of  the  learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  have  perused  the 

record with his able assistance. 

                
 
 
 
 
 
4. 

Admittedly,  marriage  between  the  petitioner 

and  the  respondent  is  still  intact  and  respondent 

had  to  file  the  suit inter-alia seeking  restitution  of 

conjugal  rights.  So 

far  as 

the  quantum  of 

maintenance 

is  concerned,  the  petitioner  has 

placed  on  record Nikahnama  dated  04.01.2018.  In 

column  17  of  the  said  Nikahnama,  the  petitioner 

had agreed to pay monthly maintenance allowance 

at the rate  of Rs.20,000/-  to  the respondent during 

a nuptial dispute. The factual grounds raised by the 

petitioner  regarding  his  monthly  income  require 

recording of evidence and cannot be considered in 

the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.   

5. 

In  view  of  above,  the  instant  petition  being 

devoid of merit is dismissed in limine.
