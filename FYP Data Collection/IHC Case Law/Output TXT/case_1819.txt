23.07.2019  Mr. Muhammad  Mustafa Khattak, Advocate  for the

Order with signature  of Judge  and  that of parties  or counsel
where  necessary

petitioner.

Through the instant writ petition,  the
petitioner,  Mst. Shakeela  Akhtar, impugns  (i) the
order and decree dated  27.05.2019,  passed  by
the learned Family Court on the basis of the
compromise  arrived at between  the petitioner
and respondent No.3 (Arif Ullah) regarding  the
custody,  visitation and maintenance  for their
children, and (ii) judgment  dated 18.07.2019,
whereby  the petitioner's  appea! against the said
order and decree dated 27.05.20119,  was
dismissed by the Court  of the learned  Additional

District  Judge, lslamabad.
2.  Learned counsel for  the  petitioner
submitted  that the concurrent judgments/orders
passed by the learned  Courts below  suffer from
jurisdictional  irregularities  warranting
interference  in the Constitutional  jurisdiction  of
this Court; that the petitioner's  counsel  was not
present before the learned Family Court when
the  impugned order and decree dated
27.O5.2O19, was passed; that the petitioner  had
replaced her earlier  counsel,  with her present
counsel  but despite the said replacement,  the
learned Family Court d:d not mark the
attendance of the petitioner's present  counsel;
that the petitioner is an illiterate  woman and did
not understand  the terms of the compromise
recorded by the learned  Family Court in its order
dated 27.05.2O19; that the petitioner  has no

Family Court'boercively  and harshly"asked  the
petitioner  to sign the order sheet  so as to benefit
respondent  No.3; and that the petitioner's
present counsel did not appear before the
learned Family Court on 27 .O5.2O19  since he was
busy  before  this Court. Learned  counse! for the
petitioner prayed for the writ petition to be
allowed in terms of the relief sought therein.
3. 
I have heard the contentions  of the learned
counsel  for the petitioner  and have perused  the

record  with his able assistance.
4.  The record shows that the petitioner and
respondent  No.3 were married on 11.11.2OO7.
The couple were blessed with three children out
of whom one had passed  away at the age of
seven. The strained relations  between  the
petitioner and respondent  No.3 have caused
them to separate. Their two minor  children  are
presently  in the petitioner's custody.
5.  On 29.01.2018, respondent  No.3 filed a
petition under Section 25 of the Guardian and
Wards Act, 1890, seeking the custody  of his two
minor  children.  During the pendency  of the said
petition,  a compromise  was arrived at between
the petitioner and respondent No.3. This
compromise  was recorded by the learned  Family
Court in its order dated 27.05.2019,  whereafter  a
decree in terms of the compromise  was passed.
By virtue of the said compromise,  the custody  of
the minors remains  with the petitioner,  and a
visitation  schedule has been agreed  upon. This
visitation schedule is reflected in the order and
decree dated 27.05.2019.
I have gone through the said visitation
6. 
schedule  and find the same to be just and
reasonable. Visitation  schedule  based on
reconciliation/compromise between parties  was
endorsed by the Hon'ble Supreme  Court in the
case of Madiha Younas  VS lmran Ahmed (2018

scMR  1991).

7. 
lt is well settled that a father cannot be
deprived of his visitation rights regarding  his
minor children. Reference  may be made to the
iudoments in the case of Mst. Hira VS 7h
Additional Sessions Judge. Hyderabad  (2019
MLD 804). Mst. Maryam  Masood VS Mughisuddin
Mirza (2009 CLC 1443). Saad Amanullah Khan
VS IVTH-Senior Civil Judge.  (South)  Karachi
(PLD 2008 Karachi  499) and Umar Farooq VS

Khushbakhat Mirza (PLD 2008 Lahore  527).
8.  Since I have been given no reason  to
interfere with the concurrent  judgments/orders
passed by the learned  Courts  below,  the instant
petition  is
