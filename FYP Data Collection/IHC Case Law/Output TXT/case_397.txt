MOHSIN  AKHTAR  KAYANI,  J:  By  way  of  this  common  Judgment  I

the  Executive  Director  (Regulations)  SECP  dated  06.08.2019,  whereby,  a  show

2.

W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 2 

petitioners  are  primarily  aggrieved  to  the  impugned  order  passed  on  the 

application filed by respondent No. 3 to 6 before the Commission on 04.08.2007 

with  the  request  for  Special  Audit  of  the  Company  and  appointment  of  an 

Auditor to carry out detail scrutiny of the affairs Of company under section 234-A 

of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  (repealed  law),  which  was  allowed  by  the 

SECP in way of issuance of impugned show cause notice. 

3. 

In Writ Petition No.3322 of 2019 M/s United Industries Limited as well as 

M. Akbar Muggo  also assailed the same  show  cause notice dated  06.08.2019 on 

similar grounds as referred in the body of the petition. 

4. 

Brief history of these cases are that, an application under section 234-A of 

the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  was  filed  by  four  share  holders  i.e.  respondent 

Nos.  3  to  6  in  both  of  these  petitions  with  the  claim  that  there  are  gross 

malfeasance and falsification of accounts committed over number of years by the 

Chief  Executive  and  other  members  of  the  Management  of  United  Industries 

Limited  and  those  applicants  are  deprived  of  their  due  return  on  their 

investment and funds have been siphoned off from the company. Ninety percent 

of the shares of United Industries Limited were purchased by M/s Akbar Muggo 

&  Associates  from  Ghee  Corporation  of  Pakistan  Limited,  Lahore  through 

Privatization  Commission  in  the  year  1992,  which  is  a  leading  manufacturer  of 

Kashmir Banaspati, Kashmir Cooking Oil  and Laundry Soap. As such  there are 

two  groups  of  share  holders  in  the  company  who  are  holding  equal  numbers  of 

shares  of  the  company  from  the  date  of  the  purchase  and  the  applicants  / 

respondents claims that they own half of the purchased shares in terms of Form-29 

of 1993.  

5. 

It  has  been  complained  by  the  applicant  /respondents  that  Mr.  Akbar 

Muggo in capacity to Chief Executive is conducting the affairs of the company in 

an unlawful and fraudulent manner that is oppressive to the interest of Directors 

/  Shareholders  and  is  also  in  contravention  of  the  Memorandum  &  Articles  of 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 3 

the  Association  of  the  Company,  in  which  certain  illegalities  have  been 

highlighted i.e.  

i.  Maintenance of dual business accounts for the company. 

ii.  The evasion of government taxes 

iii.  Unauthorized framed benefits for Chief Executive and his family. 

iv.  Unlawful extraction of funds out of the company accounts. 

v.  Consumption of Sui Gas. 

vi.  Advertisement and promotional activities. 

vii.  Comparison  of  packing  material  between  United  Industries 

Limited and Unilever (Pakistan) LTD. 

viii.  Variance in consumption of Chemicals. 

ix.  Expansion in plant & machinery Viz a Viz production capacity. 

x.  Expansion in building & plant / machinery. 

xi.  Comparison of cost / ton selling & distribution expenses. 

xii.  Violation of company law. 

xiii.  Details of assets owned by Mr. Akbar Muggo from the year 2003  

6. 

In view of the above objections and issues highlighted in the application, 

in  terms  of  section  234-A  of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  the  respondents 

have prayed for the following  

Under  the above  mentioned circumstances  we four  undersigned 

Directors / Shareholders request you to accept our application under 

section 234-A of Companies Ordinance 1984 for ordering of Special 

Audit of the Company and appoint an auditor to carry out detailed 

scrutiny of the affairs of the United Industries Limited. 

  We also agree  to share the cost of audit under the Sec 234-A of 

the Company Law. 

7. 

The  above  mentioned  application  was  allowed  vide  order  dated 

03.09.2008 by the Executive director SECP, whereby, he directed to conduct  the 

special  audit  of  the  company,  even  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  above 

mentioned  order  were  also  framed  by  the  Executive  Director  SECP  for 

conducting audit for the period of 01.07.2004 to 30.06.2007. 

8. 

The respondent No.8 alongwith the petitioners being dissatisfied with the 

order of Executive Director SECP, preferred an appeal before the appellate bench 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 4 

of  SECP,  whereafter  the  original  order  has  been  maintained  vide  dated 

19.12.2008. The petitioners and respondent No.8 have challenged the said order 

through  two  separate  writ  petition  Nos.2044  and  2045  of  2009,  which  was 

decided  through  a  consented  order  of  both  the  parties  vide  order  dated 

03.05.2017 with the following observations: 

In view of above, impugned order dated 03.09.2008 is hereby set-

aside  and  matter  is  remanded  back  to  SECP  and  relevant  authority  of 

SECP is directed to decide this matter afresh after hearing the parties in 

the light of objections raised in W.P No. 2045/2009 and 2044/2009 and 

pass  speaking  order  while  considering  the  order  dated  02.03.2016, 

passed in C.O No.35/2006 by Lahore High Court, Lahore. 

9. 

Keeping in view the above mentioned order, matter was remanded to the 

appellate  forum  of  SECP  for  adjudication  whereafter;  impugned  show  cause 

notice  has  been  issued,  which  has  been  assailed  by  the  petitioners  and 

respondent No.8 separately through petitions in hand. 

10. 

Learned  counsel  Mr.  Sikandar  Bashir  Mohmand  advocate  on  behalf  of 

petitioner in writ petition No.3321 of 2019, while arguing this case has raised the 

following questions: 

i.  Petitioners were never issued any notice after the remittance of case 

to  the  respondent  Nos.1  &  2  by  the  Islamabad  High  Court, 

Islamabad on the basis of consent order passed in the writ petitions 

and  without  calling  upon  the  petitioners,  getting  their  response  or 

hearing them, impugned notice was issued. 

ii.  The impugned proceedings are in clear violation of this court’s order, 

as  it  is  a  matter  of  record  that  issue  was  confined  to  the  question 

whether  in  the  changed  circumstances  a  special  audit  as  per 

insertion  in  law  which  was  declared  ultra  vires  could  be  taken  by 

SECP. 

iii.  The  show  cause  notice  was  not  made  any  reference  to  any  order 

passed  by  the  commission,  and  simply  reproduced  the  points 

allegedly raised, but records no decision. 

iv.  The  application  under  section  234-A  having  becoming  infructuous 

could  not  be  converted  into  Suo  Moto  in  the  proceedings  under 

 
 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 5 

section 256(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2017, nor could such power 

vest any authority under the law. 

11. 

Conversely  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.3  to  6  have  resisted  the 

instant Writ Petitions primarily on the ground that they are holding 49% as well 

as the petitioners also hold 49% shares of the company, whereas, remaining 2% 

shares  alleged  to  have  been  taken  over  by  the  respondent  No.8  from 

Privatization Commission is disputed, which is pending with the Hon’ble Lahore 

High  Court  in  ICA  No.10  of  2016  titled  as  (Mian  Waqar-ud-Din  and  others  VS 

United Industries Limited and others), though, the said ICA is not  an issue before 

this court. 

12. 

In terms of section 513 of the Companies Act, 2017 all amendments made 

to erstwhile ordinance through Finance Acts have been validated; thus, all of the 

intentions  and  purpose  of  section  234-A  of  the  erstwhile  ordinance  stands 

protected.  It  is  the  prerogative  of  the  respondent  /  SECP  to  initiate  Suo  Moto 

proceeding  under  section  256(1)(a)  of  the  Companies  Act,  2017,  as  and  when 

sufficient material is brought to its notice. 

13. 

That the  SECP being  apex regulator after  going through the audit report 

prepared  by  M/s  Avais,  Hyder  Liaquat  Nauman,  Charted  Accountants,  for the 

period  01.07.2006  to  31.12.2014  revealed  that  same  was  an    audit  conducted  on 

sample basis which at best encompassed only five percent of the total record of 

the respondent company. 

14. 

That  auditors  highlighted  in  the  report  that  the  management  i.e. 

petitioners group have siphoned off amounts running into hundreds of millions 

of rupees. 

15. 

The respondent / SECP in terms of section 10 of SECP Act, 1997 read with 

companies Act, 2107 is fully competent to delegate its functions to its officers. 

16. 

Similarly,  learned  counsel for  respondent Barrister Minaal Tariq  has also 

opposed the instant writ petitions on the ground that the petitioners were given 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 6 

due  right  of  hearing,  even  their  attendance  have  been  marked  by  the 

representatives / duly authorized advocate, who participated in the proceedings, 

which  is  evident  from  the  attendance  record  and  as  such  the  order  has  been 

passed in accordance with law. 

17. 

That  show  cause  notices  are  not  to  be  considered  as  a  conclusive  order, 

rather option  is  given to  the  petitioners  to  submit  their  reply  with  the  detail  or 

any  other  ground  which  they  intend  to  take  alongwith  other  record  before 

passing  the  final  order  on  the  pending  application,  therefore,  no  prejudice  has 

been caused, hence writ petitions are not maintainable. 

18.  Arguments heard, record perused. 

19. 

Perusal  of  record  reveals  that  the  petitioners  and  respondent  No.8  are 

primarily  aggrieved  with  the  show  cause  notice  dated  06.08.2019  issued  by  the 

Executive Director (Regulations) SECP on the application filed by the respondent 

No.3 to 6 in terms of Section 234-A of the repealed Companies Ordinance, 1984 

which was previously allowed by the Executive Director SECP vide order dated 

03.09.2008  and  the  same  was  assailed  by  the  petitioners  and  respondent  No.  8 

through Writ Petition Nos. 2044 and 2045 of 2009 titled as (M/s United Industries 

Limited, etc VS Mian Qaqar-ud-Din, etc) and (M. Jahangir Muggo, etc VS SECP, etc 

respectively.  With  consent  of  both  the  parties  the  previous  order  was  set-aside 

vide order dated 03.05.2017 by this court with direction to the  SECP authorities 

to decide and adjudicate the matter by passing speaking order while considering 

the  order  dated  02.03.2016  passed  in  C.O  No.  35  of  2006  by  the  Lahore  High 

Court, Lahore. 

20. 

The  appended  record  and  history  of  this  case  reveals  that  C.O  No.35  of 

2006  titled  as  (Mian  Waqar-ud-Din  etc  VS  M/s  United  industries  Limited,  etc)  was 

filed  in  terms  of  section  305,  309  and  290  of  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  in  the 

year 2006 before Hon’ble Lahore High Court, Company Bench by the respondent 

No.3  to  6,  referring  serious  allegations  whereby  it  was  alleged  that  funds  have 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 7 

been  dishonesty  diverted,  different  amounts  of  the  company  have  been  used 

without  approval  of  the  board  and  never  been  listed  in  the  books,  even  a 

mismanagement  of  the  company  affairs  were  also  part  of  the  grounds.  The 

petition was contested by the present petitioners and finally the Hon’ble Lahore 

High  Court  vide  its  judgment  dated  02.03.2016  reported  as  2017  CLD  696 

[Lahore]  titled  as  (Mian  Waqar-ud-Din  VS  United  Industries  Limited,  etc) 

dismissed  the  petition  for  winding  up  of  the  company.  However,  certain 

directions were passed in exercise of powers under section 290 of the Companies 

Ordinance, 1984, where present petitioners were directed to buy out the shares in 

proportion  of  the  shares  held  by  the  respondents  on  the  basis  of  evaluation 

determined  by  the  auditors  appointed  by  the  court  in  the  report;  three  months 

time has been referred for completion of transaction; similarly the auditors were 

directed  to  calculate  the  profit  accrued  to  the  company  from  the  period 

01.01.2015  till  passing  of  the  judgment;  even  directions  were  issued  to  the 

directors of the company to hold meeting of the Board of Directors and  Annual 

General  Meeting  to  approve  the  financial  statements;  as  well  as  the  audited 

financial  accounts  and  reports  be  also  submitted  before  board  of  directors  for 

their approval. 

21. 

The  above  mentioned  order  has  been  assailed  in  ICA  No.02  of  2015, 

whereby,  the  Hon’ble  Division  Bench  of  the  Lahore  High  Court  suspended  the 

portion of the impugned order containing directions vide order dated 28.06.2016 

and the matter is still pending.  

22.  Now question arises as to whether after the enactment of the Companies 

Act, 2017, which has been notified in Gazette on 31.05.2017, any application under 

repealed  ordinance  of  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  is  maintainable  or  otherwise, 

qua the special audit request of the respondents, when no concept of especial audit 

is  available  in  the  present  law  rather  a  generalized  concept  of  audit  has  been 

referred  in  terms  of  section  256  with  auditors  right  to  information  and  duties  of 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 8 

auditor  in  terms  of  section  248  and  249  of  the  Act.  The  plain  reading  of  these 

provisions  prima  facie  reveals  that  a  company’s  auditor  shall  conduct  the  audit  and 

prepare  his  report  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  International  Standards  on 

auditing. However the Commission may by general or especial order, direct, the 

statement of compliance as contained in section 227 of the Companies Act, 2017. 

The  Act  also  provides  penalty  for  any  contravention  or  default  in  compliance 

with  the  requirements  of section 246, 247, 248  &  250 of the Companies Act, but 

despite this complete mechanism, no concept of especial audit is envisaged in the 

new law.  

23. 

In  order  to  resolve  the  controversy  in  legal  sense,  it  is  necessary  to 

compare  the  provision  of  section  234-A  of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  i.e.  

especial  auditing  viz  a  viz  investigation  into  affairs  of  company  in  terms  of 

section 256 of the Companies Act, 2017, the same has been reproduced as under:

appointing  an  inspector,  require 
the applicants to give such security 
for  payment  of  the  costs  of  the

may specify. 

24.  After careful comparison of both the provisions referred above, it is made 

clear that both these provisions of repealed law and the present law are different 

in nature having different requirements, no doubt in both these concept, special 

audit  and  investigation,  the  Commission  has  its  Suo  Moto  powers,  but  with 

certain qualifications like under Companies Act, 2017 investigation could only be 

carried out into the affairs of the company where Commission is of the opinion 

that  it    is  necessary  to  investigate  into  the  affairs  of  the  company,  which  is 

qualified with application of share holders in sub clause (a) & (b) of sub section 

(1)  of  section  256,  which  could  only  be  initiated  on  the  request  of  the  share 

holders.  However,  in  exercise  of  Suo  Moto  powers  the  Commission  has  to 

formulate  its  opinion  on  the  receipt  of  a  report  prepared  by  authorized  officer  of  the 

Commission after inspection of books of accounts and books and papers of the company in

books  or  papers  or  documents  in  question  discloses  an  unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs  or 

that it does  not discloses a full and fair  statement of  the matter to which it  purports to 

relate. 

25.  Now  adverting  towards  the  present  case  while  considering  the  reasons 

prevailed  upon  Executive  Director  SECP  who  issued  a  show  cause  notice  as  to 

whether any such report has been referred or there was an opinion of registrar of 

SECP  on  the  basis  of  report  of  authorized  officer  of  the  Commission  where  he 

feels  unsatisfied.  However,  on  minute  scanning  of  the  show  cause  notice,  no 

opinion  has  been  referred  on  the  basis  of  inspection  of  books  of  accounts  and 

papers  of  the  company,  neither  any  unsatisfactory  state  of  affairs  have  been 

disclosed  qua  any  information  or  explanation  rendered  by  the  petitioners.  It  is 

trite law that things have to be done in a manner and mode in which they have 

been prescribed and all other modes stand excluded if not acted in that manner 

as  held  in  2020  SCMR  2129  (Ajmir  Shah,  Ex-Sepoy  VS  The  Inspector  General, 

Frontier  Corps  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  another),  PLD  2018  [SC]  189 

(Muhammad Hanif Abbasi VS Imran Khan Niazi and others), PLD 2016 [SC] 995 

(Shahida  Bibi  and  others  VS  Habib  Bank  Limited  and  others),  PLD  2013  [SC] 

255 (Muhammad Anwar and others VS Mst. Ilyas Begum and others). As such, 

the minimum requirement to exercise the powers of Suo Moto by the Commission 

are  subject  to  opinion  based  upon  the  information  and  explanation  claimed  by 

the Registrar on the basis of inspection report submitted by the authorized officer 

of the commission in terms of section 221 (5) of the Act and if no such documents 

are available before the Executive Director, any order of investigation into affairs 

of the company is considered to be an illegal affair and beyond its jurisdiction. 

26. 

This court has also gone through the concept of investigation provided in 

the repealed law Viz a Viz  the present Companies Act, 2017, which commonly 

reveals  that  whenever  the  affairs  of  company  have  been  managed  through  an 

unlawful  or  fraudulent  manner  and  the  minor  share  holders  rights  have  been 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 11 

prejudiced  or  management  of  the  company  has  been  conducted  in  a  manner 

prejudicial  to  the  interest  of  the  creditors  or  of  the  public  interest,  such  aspect 

could only be determined on the basis of report submitted by the registrar of the 

companies in terms of sub section (6) of section 261 or on the inspection report of 

books of accounts, papers of the company or on the report of authorized officer 

in terms of  sub section  (5)  of section 231 of the  Companies ordinance,  1984; the 

repealed  law,  therefore,  investigation  could  be  ordered  on  the  basis  of  opinion 

formulated by the Commission. The primary reason for investigation has clearly 

been  explained  in  sub  clause  (i)  to  (vii)  of  sub  section  (b)  of  section  265  of  the 

Companies Ordinance, 1984. These provisions are equal to the section 256 of the 

Companies Act, 2017 which is parameteria to the new provision. In view of this 

legal  position  the  concept  of  special  audit  in  terms  of  section  234-A  of  the 

Companies  Ordinance,  1984  is  not  available  in  the  new  law  neither  could  be 

equated  with  the  provision  of  section  256  of  the  Companies  Act,  2017,  as 

conducting a  special audit might be a part of investigation at the larger context 

but it should not be equated with investigation. 

27. 

The  old  provisions  of  special  audit  in  terms  of  section  234-A  of  the 

Companies  Ordinance,  1984,  refers  its  character  highlighted  in  term  “special” 

which could not be treated as in general concepts, especially when the concept of 

audit  has  separately  been  explained  in  section  252  of  the  same  ordinance 

whereby,  every  company  shall  at  each  annual  general  meeting  appoint  an 

auditor  whose  duties  has  been  explained  in  section  255  of  the  ordinance,  the 

report    prepared  by  the  auditor  has  to  be  read  before  the  company  in  general 

meeting  and  shall  be  open  to  inspection  by  any  member  of  the  company,  even 

audit  of  cost  accounts  of  company  shall  be  conducted  on  the  direction  of  the 

Federal Government for those companies referred in sub clause (e) of sub section 

(1)  of  section  230  of  the  Ordinance,  engaged  in  production,  processing, 

manufacturing  or  mining  activities.  All 

these  aspects  differentiate 

the 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 12 

requirement and procedures for application of specialized audit process viz a viz 

the general audit concept in the old law as well as concept of investigation in the 

new law.  

28. 

It  is  trite  law  that  special  provision  of  law  i.e.  Special  Audit  in  terms  of 

Section  234-A  of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  has  its  own  criteria  and 

application  under  the  repealed  ordinance  if  considered  in  the  light  of  general 

provision  of  the  same  law.  The  Courts  usually  interpret  the  concept  of  special 

provision  by  excluding  the  general  provision  in  the  same  law,  rather  special 

provision  controls  the  general  provision  as  held 

in  2014  SCMR  1268 

(A.Qutubudin Khan VS CHEC Millwala  Dredging Company Pvt. Limited),2012 

SCMR  669  (Capt.  R.  Nayyar  Islam  VS  Judge  Accountability  Court-III  and 

others.),  2010  SCMR  229  (United  Bank  Limited  VS  Mst.  Jameela  Mumtaz  and 

others),  (PLD  1991  SC  143  (Brig.  Sher  Ali  Aaz  and  another  VS  The  Secretary 

Establishment Davison and an others). 

29. 

In  view  of  above  position,  the  special  provision  as  applied  by  the 

respondent/Executive Director in the impugned Show Cause Notice in concept 

of  Special  Audit  under  Section  234-A  has  incorrectly  been  applied,  especially 

when the entire concept of Special Audit has been eliminated in the new law.   

30.  Ordinarily  where  the  plain  language  of  statues  admits  of  no  other 

interpretation than intention of legislature conveyed through such language is to 

be given its full effect as held in PLD 2015 [SC] 501 (Ghulam Haider VS Murad 

through  legal  representatives).  This  principle  has  also  been  highlighted  in  PLD 

2012  [SC]  923  (Baz  Muhammad  Kakar  VS  Federation  of  Pakistan  through 

Ministry of Law and Justice), 1998 SCMR 841 (Pakistan International Airlines 

Corporation,  Karachi  VS  Wafaqi  Mohtasib),  hence  the  plain  unambiguous 

words must be expounded in their natural and ordinary sense as reflected from 

the  plain  reading  of  section  234-A  of  the  Companies  Ordinance,  1984  viz  a  viz 

section  256  of  Companies  Act,  2017,  resultantly  both  the  provisions  are  not 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 13 

parameteria  nor  having  any  nexus  with  each  other.  This  court  has  also 

considered  the  two  headings  used  in  these  two  laws  “special  audit  viz  a  viz 

investigation into the affairs of company” referred in both these sections of law, 

which  clearly  establish  that  both  these  headings  which  are  prefix  to  section 

indicates  factors  to  be  considered  therein,  which  gives  the  intentions  of  the 

legislature  and  as  such  the  detail  provided  in  the  respective  sections  if 

considered  with  the  heading  there  is  no  ambiguity  to  establish  that  what  is  the 

purpose  of  these  provisions.  Under  ordinary  rules  of  interpretation  heading 

prefixed to sections usually control the plain words of the provision, though it is 

not a hard and fast rule but  language implied in the heading cannot be used to 

give  a  different  affect  to  clear  words  of  the  Section  where  there  cannot  be  any 

doubt as to their ordinary meaning as held in (Iqbal Sing Marwah VS Meenakshi 

Marwah) (2005) 4 SCC 370, therefore only in case of ambiguity or doubt heading 

or sub-heading may be referred to an aid in construing the provision as held in 

(R. Krishnaih VS State of AP) AIR 2005 AP 10. 

31. 

It has not been denied by the respondents that they have filed winding up 

petition  before  the  Company  Judge  at  Lahore,  which  was  dismissed  and  at 

present ICA No.10/2016 is pending before the Hon’ble Division Bench of Lahore 

High Court, Lahore. This aspect prima-facie discloses that reasons of winding up 

raised  by  the respondents  have  not  been  agreed  to  by the  Company  Judge  and 

some  directions  were  passed  in  para  62  of  C.O  No.35/2006  including  the 

direction to the Auditors to calculate the profit and submission of report by the 

Auditors  qua  the  audited  accounts  of  each  financial  year  but  those  directions 

were  suspended  by  the  Hon’ble  Division  Bench  in  ICA,  therefore,  claiming  the 

investigation under the garb of special audit is also considered to be in violation 

of spirit of order passed in C.O No.35/2006, even otherwise, subject direction for 

audited accounts have already been suspended. It has clearly been established on 

record  that  Company  Judge  has  not  observed  any  glaring  illegality  to  pass 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 14 

winding  up  order,  nor  any  fraud  has  been  highlighted  in  the  said  judgment 

rather the plain reading of entire judgment of Company Judge suggests that it is 

a case where certain requirements of Section 290 of Companies Ordinance, 1984, 

presently in terms of Section 286 of Companies Act, 2017 could be in existence in 

order  to  regularize  the  affairs  of  company  in  future,  whereby  necessary 

directions were already passed, therefore, when the Company Judge has already 

declared  not  to  wind  up  the  company  on  mere  allegation  suggested  by  the 

respondents it is not appropriate to pass any direction qua the investigation into 

the affairs of company in terms of Section 256 of the Companies Act, 2017 though 

it has different criteria which entails consequences. 

32. 

In order to initiate investigation into the affairs of company report under 

sub-section (5) of Section 221 of the Companies Act, 2017 is necessary which has 

close connection with Section 256 of the Act ibid and any report compiled under 

this  provision  would  logically  form  the  basis  of  an  investigation  sought  to  be 

conducted  by  the  Commission  into  the  affairs  of  that  company  as  held  in 

(Daewoo  Pakistan  Express  Bus  Service  Ltd.  and  another  VS  SECP  and  others) 

2020 CLD 919, wherein it was also held that:- 

…5.  In particular, in respect of investigation into the affairs of a company 

under  section  256,  there  are  only  three  instances  under  which  the 

investigation  can  be  ordered  by  the  Commission.  By  clause  (a)  of 

subsection (1), it can  be done  on the application of  members holding not 

less than one tenth of the total  voting  power in a company having share 

capital and in terms of clause (b) of subsection (1) on the application of not 

less  than  one  tenth  of  the  total  members  of  a  company  not  having  share 

capital.  The  learned  counsel  for  Saad  S.  Faruqui  (the  complainant) 

concedes  that  the  complainant  does  not  possess  the  qualifications 

mentioned  in  clauses  (a)  and  (b)  of  subsection  (1)  of  section  256. 

Therefore,  the  complainant  could  not  have  filed  an  application  under 

section  256  directly.  He  however  chose  an  indirect  modus  operandi  to 

trigger  and  put  into  motion  the  investigation  into  the  affairs  of  Daewoo 

envisaged  by  section  256.  For,  inevitably,  the  proceedings  under  section 

221 lead to the investigative powers contemplated by section 256 and so is 

 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 15 

equally egregious and harmful for any company which would, at once, be 

at guard of its creeping danger. The complainant simply filed a complaint 

to the Commission which passed the Inspection Order and served it upon 

Daewoo.  The  entire  basis  of  that  order  are  the  allegations  made  in  the 

complaint  on  the  part  of  the  complainant.  Thus,  plainly  and  clearly,  the 

Commission did not bring its own independent mind to bear on the entire 

aspect of the case and by acting mechanically passed the Inspection Order. 

No  reasoned  and  deliberative  process  preceded  the  making  of  the 

Inspection  Order.  This  is  against  the  grain  of  the  core  principles 

underlying section 221. For Daewoo this has unpalatable consequences, in 

that, the inspection would likely lead to the compiling of a report in terms 

of  subsection  (5)  of  section  221  and  on  which  the  Commission  would 

proceed  to  appoint  Inspectors  by  exercise  of  powers  under  section  256  of 

the Act, 2017. Therefore, the two provisions, that is, sections 221 and 256 

are  closely  tied  in  with  each  other  and  have  to  be  read  together  while 

determining the true import and construction of section 221. Surely, the 

legislature  realized  the  need  to  fence  the  powers  conferred  on  the 

Commission  and  this  intention  which  permeates  both  sections  221  and 

256 cannot be circumvented by a contraption. Learned counsel for Daewoo 

relies upon an order passed by this Court in W.P No.20088 of 2012 which 

involved  the  question  regarding  appointment  of  inspectors  under  the 

erstwhile section 231 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984 which is in pari 

materia with section 221. This judgment was followed in W.P No.27555 

of  2017  by  relying  upon  the  following  excerpt  of  the  earlier  judgment 

passed by a learned Single Judge (Shams Mehmood Mirza J.):  

" It is accepted position that report under section 231(5) can lead 

to  investigation  and  appointment  of  inspectors  under  section  263  but 

inspectors  cannot  be  appointed  simultaneously  with  the  order  of 

inspection  of  books  of  accounts  and  other  books  and  papers  as  SECP 

proceeded to do through letter dated 01.08.2012. Be that as it may, in case 

inspectors are to be appointed then prior show cause notice has to be given. 

For  all  intents  and  purposes,  through  letter  dated  01.08.2012,  SECP 

exercised powers under section 265 of the Ordinance as under section 231 

of  the  Ordinance,  it  had  no  power  to  appoint  inspectors  to  carry  out  the 

investigation  into  the  affairs  of  the  petitioners.  The  fact  that  inspectors 

were  appointed  under  section  265  of  the  Ordinance  is  furthermore 

apparent from  the task given to them in terms  of  clause  2 of  letter  dated 

 
 
 
W.P. Nos. 3321 & 3322 of 2019 

Page | 16 

01.08.2012. The registrar or the inspecting official at the most can inspect 

the  books  of  account  and  other  documents/papers  of  similar  nature  in 

exercise of powers under section 231 of the Ordinance. However, the wide 

nature  of  work  the  inspectors  were  required  to  perform  under  the 

impugned  letter  could  not  be  undertaken  in  terms  of  section  231  of  the 

Ordinance.  The  source  of  power  for  issuance  of  order/letter  dated 

01.08.2012  was  located  in  section  265  of  the  Ordinance  and,  therefore, 

SECP had to issue the show cause notice to the company before taking the 

proposed  action.  Notwithstanding  the  vital  question  of  issuance  of  show 

cause  notice,  it  is  also  to  be  noted  that  the  power  for  appointment  of 

inspectors  under  section  265(b)  of  the  Ordinance  to  carry  out  the 

investigation  in  the  affairs  of  the  company  is  discretionary  and  is 

dependent  upon  the  formation  of  an  opinion  ("in  the  opinion  of  the 

Commission") that such an investigation is necessary…" 

33. 

This court has also been guided by the judgment reported as (Hira Textile 

Mills Ltd. VS Bank Al-Falah Ltd.) 2022 CLD 285, wherein it was held that if at 

all  the  Commission  seeks  to  investigate  into  the  affairs  of  a  company  on  an 

application,  it  must  be  an  application  made  by  one  of  the  persons  or  entities 

mentioned  in  section  256  and  none  else,  even  show  cause  notice  could  only  be 

issued  by  the  Commission  while  exercising  its  suo  motu  powers  conferred  U/S 

257  by  forming  an  independent  and bipartisan  opinion.  No  doubt  investigation 

into  the  affairs  of  company  is  a  serious  matter  and  entails  consequences  both 

financial  as  well  as  goodwill  of  the  corporate  entity,  therefore,  these  powers 

could not be used lightly by the Commission. The powers to investigate into the 

affairs of company have been circumscribed by the provisions of Section 256 and 

in  case  suo  motu  powers  are  required  to  be  exercised  by  the  Commission  the 

minimum requirement mentioned in clause 13 of subsection (1) of Section 257 of 

the Companies Act, 2017 have to be looked into though such powers have to be 

preceded by formation of an opinion and there-after a show cause notice giving 

the company an opportunity of hearing could be issued. However, in case there

is  no  formation  of  opinion  by  the  Commission,  investigation  could  not  be 

initiated in a mechanical fashion. 

34. 

I  have  confronted  learned  counsel  for  the  SECP  to  demonstrate  any 

opinion  which  has  been  formulated  independently  while  considering  the 

minimum  requirement  of  investigation  into  the  affairs  of  a  company  excluding 

the  orders  of  Company  Judge,  Lahore  but  no  justiciable  reasoning  has  been 

rendered  in  writing.  In  such  circumstances,  order  passed  by  the  respondent 

SECP by issuing show cause notice is considered to be nullity in the eyes of law 

and  same  could  not  sustain  in  these  peculiar  circumstances,  therefore,  both  the 

captioned writ petitions are ALLOWED and show cause notice dated 06.08.2019, 

issued  by  Executive  Director  (Regulations),  SECP  is  hereby  SET-ASIDE. 

However, affairs of company should be regulated subject to final decision of ICA 

No. 10/2016, if no other violation has been committed under the law.
