01 

14.01.2022  Ms. Asma Shabbir, Advocate.  

The  petitioner  assails  the  impugned  orders  dated 

01.09.2021  and  04.12.2021  passed  by  the  learned  Senior 

Civil Judge-II/Judge Family Court, Islamabad-East.

The  petitioner  is  aggrieved  because  his  right  to 

defend  was  struck-off  by  the  family  court  due  to  non-

compliance  with  the  order  of 

interim  maintenance.  

Learned  counsel  states  that  the  said  non-compliance  was 

not deliberate but was on account of the Courts not being 

functional due to the Covid pandemic for the period when 

the  interim  maintenance  was  payable  and,  despite  the 

petitionerâ€™s readiness to comply, he was unable to deposit 

interim  maintenance. 

  She  further  submits  that  the 

mischief section 17-A of the Family Courts Act, 1964 was 

directed at was the deliberate refusal to deposit the interim 

maintenance  and  not  where  the  inability  to  comply  was 

due  to  unavoidable  circumstances.    She  relies  on  the 

citation  titled  Dr.  Aqueel  Waris  V/s  Ibrahim  Aqueel  etc, 

2020 CLC 131, Islamabad.
