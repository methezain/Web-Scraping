Proceedings 

22.01.2021  Ms.  Natalya  Kamal,  Advocate  and  Mr.  Hassan 

Adnan Ahmed, Advocate for petitioner.  
Sardar  Shabbir  Hussain,  Advocate,  Barrister 
Adnan Saboor Rohaila, Advocate.   

Respondent  No.2  filed  an  application 

under section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act, 

1890, against the petitioner, for obtaining custody 

of  his  minor  child  namely  Kamil  Wahid  Abid, 

which is pending before respondent No.1. In the 

referred proceedings, an application was filed by 

the petitioner  under  section 12  of  Guardian  and 

Wards  Act,  1890  praying  that  respondent  No.2 

be restrained to interfere in the school affairs of 

aforementioned  minor  son.  Meanwhile, 

the 

minor  Kamil  Wahid  Abid  was  withdrawn  from 

the  school  due  to  acrimonious  behavior  of 

petitioner  and  respondent  No.2.  In  this  view  of 

the  matter,  learned  trial  court  directed  both  the 

parties  to  file  list  of  schools  of  their  choice  for 

admission of the minor. The petitioner remained 

adamant  minor’s  school  i.e.  Tree  House  School 

should not be changed, whereas respondent No.2 

submitted  list  of  schools  which  included  Lahore 

Grammar  School,  H-8/1,  Islamabad,  Headstart 

School,  F-6/2,  Islamabad  and  Beacon  House 

School System, F-8/2, Islamabad. On the basis of 

said  list,  learned  trial  court  ordered  to  admit  the

child 

in  Lahore  Grammar  School,  H-8/1 

Islamabad,  which  order  has  been  assailed  in  the 

instant petition. 

2. 

Learned counsel for the petitioner inter alia 

contended  that  order  impugned  is  capricious, 

whimsical  and  perverse 

in 

the 

facts  and 

circumstances of the case; that learned trial court 

should  have  acted  in  loco parentis  and  passed  the 

order  in  welfare  of  the  minor;  that  the  minor 

child  is  eight  years  old  and  is  not  happy  in  new 

set up. When confronted as to the maintainability 

of instant petition, learned counsel submitted that 

since  order 

impugned 

is 

capricious 

and 

whimsical, hence writ petition is maintainable. In 

support  of  contentions,  learned  counsel  placed 

reliance on cases reported as ‘Maliha Hussain VS 

Additional  District  Judge-V  and  another  (2017 

MLD 485), ‘Miss Hina Jilani, Director of A.G.HS 

Legal  Aid  Cell  VS  Sohail  Butt’  (PLD  1995 

Lahore  151),  ‘Mst.  Nafeesa  VS Mir  Bahadir  and 

2-others’  (2013  CLC  1784),  ‘Mst.  Rani  VS  Bilal 

Ahmad  and  2-others’  (2000  MLD  1967),  ‘Sardar 

Muhammad Jahangir VS Judge Family Court and 

2-others’  (2015  CLC  990),  ‘Ali  Adnan  Dar 

through  Attorney  VS  Judge  Family  Court  and 

others’  (PLD  2016  Lahore  73),  ‘Abrar  Hussain 

VS  Mehwish  Rana  and  3-others’  (PLD  2012 

Lahore  420),  ‘Mst.  Maham  Shabbir  VS  Salman 

Haider  and  others’  (2014  CLC  330),  ‘Jaffar 

Mehmood  Malik  VS  Ch.  Khalid  Hussain  and 

others’  (2006  YLR  1516),  ‘Ashiq  Hussain  VS 

Sikandar  Shah  and  14-others’  (2011  CLC  373), 

‘Messrs Habib Bank Limited through Authorized 

Officers/Attorneys VS Messrs Victor Electronics 

Appliances  Industries  Pvt.  Ltd.  and  another’

(2011  CLC  1571),  ‘Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan 

through  Secretary,  Establishment  Division, 

Islamabad  and  others  VS  Muhammad  Zaman 

Khan and others’ (1997 SCMR 1508). 

3. 

Learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.2 

objected to the maintainability of the petition and 

submitted that order impugned is interlocutory in 

nature  hence  writ  petition  is  not  maintainable 

unless  same 

is  patently 

illegal  and  without 

jurisdiction,  which 

is  not  the  case.  It  was 

contended that petitioner invoked the jurisdiction 

of learned trial court hence cannot term the order 

as without jurisdiction; he submitted that child is 

doing  well  in  new  school  and  also  placed  on 

record academic report in this regard. In support 

of  contentions,  learned  counsel  placed  reliance 

on cases reported as ‘Badruddin Roshan VS Mst. 

Razia  Sultana  and  another’  (2002  SCMR  371), 

‘Mst.  Maham  Shabbir  VS  Salman  Haider  and 

others’ (2014 CLC 330), ‘Mst. Muniba Raheel VS 

Raheel  Taufiq  Feroz  and  another’  (2020  CLC 

1353) and ‘Mujeeb Ur Rehman and 2-others VS 

Mst.  Mehroon  Nisa  alias  Tanzil  Begum  and  4-

others’ (2019 CLC 1352). 

4. 

Arguments  advanced  by  learned  counsel 

for 

the  parties  have  been  heard  and 

the 

documents,  placed  on  record,  examined  with 

their able assistance. 

5. 

The  facts,  leading  to  filing  of  instant 

petition,  have  been  mentioned  hereinabove 

therefore need not be reiterated.  

6. 

It  is  an  admitted  position  that  the  order 

impugned,  in  the  instant  petition,  does  not 

dispose 

of 

entire 

lis 

and 

the 

application/proceedings,  out  of  which,  instant 

 
 
 
 
W.P. No.2360-2020 

4 

petition has arisen, is still pending. In this behalf, 

section  14  of  Family  Courts  Act,  1964  provides 

for  right  of  appeal  against  final  decision  and/or 

judgment and decree. The order impugned, in the 

instant  petition  cannot  be  termed  as 

‘final 

decision’  or  ‘judgment  and  decree’,  hence  is  an 

interlocutory order, against which, no appeal lies. 

In  such  view  of  the  matter,  it  is  trite  law  that 

interim/interlocutory  order  can  be  assailed,  if 

same is without jurisdiction and patently illegal or 

otherwise  is  perverse.  Though  learned  counsel 

for  the  petitioner  did  argue  that  the  order 

impugned  is  final,  however,  if  this  argument  is 

accepted, section 14 of Family  Courts  Act, 1964 

would  be  applicable  and  writ  would  not  be 

competent.  

7. 

The  case  law,  cited  by  both  the  sides 

mentioned  hereinabove, 

lays  down  the  trite 

principle  that  interim/interlocutory  order  can 

only  be  called  in  question  in  an  application  and 

not under Article 199 of the Constitution unless 

same  is  without  jurisdiction,  patently  illegal  or 

perverse. Admittedly, the order in question is not 

without jurisdiction or illegal otherwise.  

8. 

The  learned  trial  court,  in  the  facts  and 

circumstances  of 

the 

case, 

exercised 

its 

jurisdiction  by  ordering  the  admission  of  minor 

in a new school namely Lahore Grammar School. 

9. 

The  fact  that  minor  is  not  happy  or  is 

finding  it  difficult  to  adjust  in  new  school  does 

not mean that the discretion exercised by learned 

trial court is unreasonable or inappropriate in the 

facts  and  circumstances.  The 

report  card 

submitted during course of proceedings indicates 

that the minor is doing well in new school.

10. 

In  view  of  foregoing,  instant  petition  is 

without  merit  and 

is  accordingly  dismissed. 

However,  since  the  matter  is  still  pending  with 

the  Guardian  Court  and  it  has 

loco  parentis 

jurisdiction,  therefore,  if  any  of  the  party  feels 

that school of minor needs to be changed for any 

reason  otherwise,  may 

file  an  appropriate 

application in this behalf.
