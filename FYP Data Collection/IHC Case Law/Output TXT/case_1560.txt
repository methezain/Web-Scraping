Sahibzada  Riazat  ul  Haq,  Advocate  for 
the  petitioner. 

The  petitioner,  in  the  instant  petition, 

has made  the  following  prayers:- 

"It  is,  therefore,  respectfully  prayed 

before  this  Honorable  Court  that  the  instant 

writ  petition  may  kindly  be  accepted  and 

necessary  directions  be  issued  to respondents 

No.J &2  to  take  criminal  action  under  army 

act  be  taken  against  the  respondents  No.4-6 

and  criminal  proceedings  under  P.P.C.  he 

initiated  against  respondent  No. 7  in  illegal 

confinement  and  for  giving  severe  mental 

torture  to  the  entire family  of  the  petitioner. 

Moreover,  security  may  kindly  be provided  to 

the  male  and  female  members  of 

the 

petitioner's  family in  order to save skin  of the 

petitioner 

from 

the 

tyranny 

of 

the 

agencies/officials 

for 

supremacy  of 

law, 

equity and justice. 

Any  other  relief  which  this  Honorable 

Court  may  deems fit  and proper  may  also  be 

awarded to the petitioner." 

2. 

Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner, 

inter-alia,  contends  that  a  direction  be  issued 

-2- 

Writ  Petition  No.910  of  2020 

to 

respondents  No.1  and 

2 

to 

initiate 

proceedings  against  respondents  No.4 to  6  for 

getting  involved  in  unlawful  activities.  It  was 

also  contended  that  respondents  No.4  to  6 

exceeded  their  authority  and  are  involved  in 

unlawful  activities  and  in  this  behalf  an  F.I.R. 

was also  lodged  bearing  No.84  of  2019,  Police 

Station  Industrial  Area,  Quetta  under  Section 

365/34  P.P.C. 

3. 

Arguments  advanced  by 

learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  have  been  heard 

and 

the 

documents 

placed  on 

record 

examined  with  his able  assistance. 

4. 

The 

relief,  which 

the  petitioner 

seeks, 

is  mentioned  hereinabove.  Basically 

the  same  is  twofold,  one  seeking  direction  for 

initiation  of  proceedings  against  respondents 

No.4 to  6  and  secondly  providing  of  protection 

to  the  family  of the  petitioner.  In  so far  as the 

first  part  of  prayer  is  concerned,  the  same  is 

for  initiation  of  criminal  proceedings  under  the 

Army  Act,  1956  as  well  as  Pakistan  Penal 

Code  against  respondents  No.4  to  6.  In  this 

behalf, 

the 

incident  due 

to  which 

the 

petitioner 

seeks 

initiation 

of 

criminal 

proceedings 

is  already 

reported  and 

the 

matter 

is  presumably  under 

investigation 

(F.I.R.  No.84/2019) 

by  Police  Station 

-3- 

Writ  Petition  No.910  of  2020 

Industrial  Area,  Quetta.  The  entire 

incident 

took  place beyond  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of 

this  Court  and  no  interference  can  be made  in 

the 

investigation/proceedings 

pending 

pursuant  to  the  referred  F.l.R.  In  so  far  as 

direction 

to 

respondents  No.1  and  2  qua 

actions  of 

respondents  No.4 

to 

6 

is 

concerned;  the  said  relief  is  also  not  tenable 

due  to  abovementioned 

reasons.  Moreover, 

one  of  the  relatives  of  the  petitioner  also  filed 

a  petition  before  the  Hon'ble  Balochistan  High 

Court,  however,  no  order  has  been  appended 

as  to  the  fate  of  the  petition  but  the  referred 

Hon'ble  Court  seized  of  the  matter  if  felt  that 

any  protection  is  needed  could  have  ordered 

for  initiation  of  the  case.  The  petitioner, 

it 

seems,  is  based  in  Balochistan  as  well  as  his 

family,  hence  no  order  can  be  passed  for 

providing  of  protection  to  the  petitioner  and 

his  family 

there  as  the  matter 

is  beyond 

territorial  jurisdiction  of this  Court. 

5. 

In  view  of  the  above,  the  instant 

petition 

is  without  merit  and  is  accordingly 

dismissed  in limine.
