Order with signature of Judge(s)  

Direction  

1.  For orders on MA No.4384/2024 
2.  For hearing of MA No.3778/2024 
3.  For hearing of main case 

23.05.2024

Mr. Shafqat Gul Malik, Advocate for the petitioner  
Mr. Muhammad Daud Narejo, Advocate for Respondent No.1 

-------------------- 

Learned  counsel  for  Respondent  No.1  has  filed  two  statements, 

which are taken on record. Main thrust of the arguments of the learned 

counsel  for  Respondent  No.1  is  that  he  has  challenged  the  impugned 

judgment  and  decree,  where  he  was  not  served  and  the  Court  decided 

the  matter  ex  parte.  He  adds  that  they  have  already  provided 

maintenance to the petitioner mother and that the respondent divorced 

the  petitioner  on  08.10.2019,  copy  of  such  divorce  has  been  furnished 

alongwith  the  counter  affidavit,  therefore  the  petitioner  wife  is  not 

eligible for maintenance after that date.  

For  the  period  between  the  date  of  judgment  and  the  divorce, 

learned counsel states that he has already provided sum of Rs.960,000/- 

to the mother. Coming to the question of minor it is stated that there is 

some confusion as to whether the appellate court that has enhanced the 

maintenance  of  the  minor  from  Rs.10,000/-  to  Rs.15,000/-  per  month 

has kept the earlier granted increase of 5% per annum or not. In respect 

of  the  maintenance  to  the  minor,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner 

states that since cost of living has increased, the respondent is willing to 

pay Rs.20,000/- per month from June,  2024 onwards regularly. Counsel 

for the petitioner to the contrary states that enhanced increment should 

be 20% per annum.

Since the judgment of the trial court has already been challenged 

being  rendered  ex  parte  and  counsel  for  the  petitioner  states  that  he 

intends to file objections to the respondentâ€™s claim that he has divorced 

the petitioner before the concerned trial court. 

In  these  circumstances,  the  instant  petition  is  disposed  of  with 

direction  to  the  Xth  Family  Judge,  Karachi-West  to  decide  application 

moved  by  the  respondent  husband  under  Section  9(6)  of  the  Family 

Courts Act preferably within ninety days and while doing so also consider 

the  aspect  of  the  reasonable  annual  increase  in  the  quantum  of  the 

maintenance to be provided to the minor.
