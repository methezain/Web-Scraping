------------------- 

Justice  Zulfiqar  Ahmad  Khan:-    This  petition  is  filed  against 

concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below,  where  custody  of  the  children 

was  not  seemingly  granted  to  the  grandmother  on  several  grounds 

including that minors were not going to a school, as well that one of the 

minors was doing a job in a workshop and spending all of his money over 

the  siblings.  The  petitioner,  as  admitted  by  the  counsel,  is  aged  about 

80 years, the trial court as well as appellate court have considered this 

aspect at length and have refrained from handing out custody to her. 

Perusal of the judgment dated 09.08.2023passed in Guardian and 

Wards  Appeal  No.09  of  2023  by  Additional  District  Judge-VI,  Karachi 

Central  and  order  dated  18.02.2023 passed  in  Guardian  and  Wards 

Application  No.1905  of  2022  by  XVIII-Civil  and  Family  Judge  Karachi 

Central suggests that no illegality or irregularity has been committed by 

both  the  courts  below  and  no  interference  is  warranted.  Accordingly, 

the instant petition being meritless is dismissed.
