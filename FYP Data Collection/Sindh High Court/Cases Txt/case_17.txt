Mr. Ahmed Khan Khaskheli, AAG 

------------------------- 

Zulfiqar  Ahmad  Khan,  J:-    None  present  for  the  respondent.  Learned 

counsel  for  the  petitioner  by  drawing  Court’s  attention  to  the  Bailiff 

report dated 13.01.2022states that the Bailiff report has clearly shown 

that  a  number  of  articles,  which  were  crossed  by  the  Bailiff  were  not 

handed out to the petitioner and amongst those articles   ،ٹیس اک ڈلوگ اڑب  

  شلاپ  ڈلوگ  ٹیس  اڑب  اک  یدناچ  روا  ٹیس  اک  ڈلوگ  اٹوھچ  admittedly  included.  He 

states that the signature of the petitioner available at page 155 detailed 

as  رہم  قح  یگیئادا  was  denied,  which  suggested  that  the  petitioner  had 

received  dower  amount  of  Rs.50,000/-  are  fake  as  the  petitioner  had 

denied  these  signatures,  hence in  such  circumstances  it  was incumbent 

upon the Trial Court to call hand writing expert, which exercise has not 

been done by the Trial Court, where in a cursory manner, the Trial Court 

through  its  judgment  dated  28.09.2022 only  granted  maintenance  of 

Rs.7,000/-  per  month  that  too  for  the  Iddat  period  and  held  that  the 

petitioner  (plaintiff)  was  not  entitled  to  the  dower  amount  as  well  as 

even those articles which were marked as  ‘X’ having not been received 

by the petitioner. No cogent reasons for such a conclusion are available 

in the judgment. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that while the 

petitioner  challenged  those  findings  through  Family  Appeal  No.304  of 

2022, the Appeal was dismissed also.  

In  these  circumstances,  both  the  impugned  judgments  are  set 

aside,  the  trial  Court  to  re-hear  the  parties  and  re-appreciate  the 

evidence  afresh  and  pass  a  fresh  judgment  preferably  within  three 

months.  

This petition is accordingly disposed of in these terms.
