Attorney Syed Nasim Ahmed is present in person 
Syed Murtaza Haider, Advocate for Respondent No.1 

----------------- 

Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan:-  Even today the petitioner is present 

in person and states that his counsel is unavailable. This Court time and 

again has given opportunity to the attorney of the petitioner, which he 

and his counsel has failed. Today, he has filed statement showing various 

payments made by the petitioner during the pendency of Nikkah. Except 

for  first  entry  of  Canadian  dollar  of  5,000/-,  which  the  respondent  has 

admitted  having  been  provided  to  her  as  part  of  dower,  remaining 

entries are usual expenses and the gifts required by a wife to maintain 

herself  and  the  household  during  existence  of  her  marriage.  He  states 

that there was an understanding that these small incremental payments 

will  amount  to  dower,  however  he  is  unable  to  show  any  documents 

where  such  understanding  was  recorded.  This  is  established  position  of 
law1 that these occasional small amounts do not account for dower, and 

these  were  the  grounds  on  the  basis  of  which  trial  court  as  well  as 

appellate court has already dismissed petitionerâ€™s claim. I do not see any 

illegality in the impugned judgments. 

Petition is dismissed with the cost of Rs.15,000/- payable towards 

the clinic of the High Court of Sindh.
