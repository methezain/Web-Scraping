Urgency granted. 

Exemption granted subject to all just exceptions. 

The  petition  challenges  Appellate  as  well  as  Guardian  Courts’ 

orders  dated  14.03.2024 and  04.09.2023.  Learned  counsel  for  the 

petitioner  mother  states  that  the  marriage  between  the  parties  was 

dissolved  through  Deed  of  Dissolution  of  Marriage  in  Saudi  Arabia 

(available at page 135),  where both the parents alongwith the children 

were  residing.  Thereafter,  through  an  arrangement,  the  petitioner  left 

Saudi  Arabia  and  returned  to  Pakistan  as  the  respondent  was  not 

providing  maintenance  and  the  petitioner  could  not  find  independent 

residence,  job  or  suitable  future  in  Saudi  Arabia.  Whereafter  counsel 

states  that  the  petitioner  filed  Guardian  and  Wards  application  where 

guardianship  certificate  was 

issued  to  her  through  order  dated 

24.02.2021,  one  of  the  conditions  of  the  said  Certificate  was  that  the 

petitioner  would  not  remove  the  children,  one  of  which  is  already  an 

adult,  from  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court.  Counsel  states  that  the 

petitioner  is  a  professional  doctor  and  wants  to  pursue  her  carrier 

seeking better future prospect of the children and herself opted to apply 

for  a  job  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  she  obtain  a  position  in  a 

Hospital  as  per  the  offer  letter  attached  on  page  121,  which  offer  per 

learned  counsel,  also  include  visa  for  herself.  Counsel  states  that  she

being single mother, who never re-married is raising the children to the 

best of their interests and has a thought in mind to take the children to 

UK  alongwith  her,  as  there  is  no  arrangement  to  retain  the  children  in 

Pakistan  with  someone  else,  which  application  was  dismissed  on 

04.09.2023, where the concerned Court was of the view that the case of 

the petitioner is marred with “speculations” and “contingencies”, as the 

order 

failed 

to  consider 

the  offer, 

learned  counsel  added. 

Notwithstanding  that  the  order  was  passed  when  offer  was  already  in 

hand,  whereafter  she  appealed  the  said  order,  which  request  was 

dismissed  by  the  impugned  judgment.  Counsel  states  that  irony  of  the 

fact  is  that  the  respondent  father  is  still  residing  in  Saudi  Arabia  and 

comes  to  Pakistan  only  once  a  year  for  meeting  the  children,  even  the 

maintenance is not being paid regularly. Counsel states that interest and 

welfare  of  the  minor  would  be  seriously  prejudiced  if  the  petitioner  is 

not  let  to  pursue  her  career  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  to  accompany 

her children alongwith her. Counsel relies on an order dated 21.02.2024

passed  in  C.P  No.S-202  of  2024  where  a  single  parent/mother  was 

permitted  to  pursue  her  career  abroad  and  custody  of  the  minors  was 

given  to  her,  with  option  to  the  father  to  meet  the  child  in  Dubai 

whenever he travelled to Dubai, similar relief is requested. 

Let  notice  be  issued  to  the  respondents  as  well  as  A.G  Sindh  for 

09.04.2024.  In  the  meanwhile,  operation  of  the  impugned  judgment 

dated  14.03.2024 passed  in  Guardian  and  Wards  Appeal  No.41  of  2023 

and  order  dated  04.09.2023 passed  in  Guardian  and  Wards  Application 

No.502 of 2020 to remain suspended. The petitioner would be permitted 

to apply for visa for herself and her children and once the visa has been 

granted,  to  file  a  statement  in  this  regard  for  further  orders  of  this 

Court.
