Urgency granted.

Exemption granted subject to all just exceptions. 

This  petition  challenges  the  judgment  passed  in  Family  Appeal 

No.71  of  2023,  where  per  learned  counsel,  the  earlier  decision  of  this 

Court  rendered 

in  C.P  No.S-1518  of  2022  on  31.03.2023 was 

implemented by reducing the earlier granted installments of Rs.20,000/- 

per  month  to  Rs.15,000/-  per  month  in  respect  of  the  dowry  articles. 

Counsel  states  that  in  fact  the  trial  court,  which  had  earlier  awarded 

Rs.5,000/- per month for the Iddat period to the petitioner as well as to 

pay  Rs.3,000/-  to  Rs.4,000/-  per  month  for  the  minor  was  appealed  by 

the petitioner in Family Appeal No.49 of 2020 wherein through judgment 

dated  14.02.2022,  maintenance  was  enhanced  to  Rs.8,000/-  per  month 

as well as the plaintiff was entitled to recover all the dowry articles as 

per  the  list  annexed  with  the  plaint  excluding  certain  articles  or  in 

alternate to receive Rs.250,000/-. Per learned counsel, in the execution 

proceedings  the 

respondent  moved  an  application 

for  making 

installments  of  the  amount  of  Rs.250,000/-,  which  application  was 

allowed  by  order  dated  21.01.2023 however  having  obtained  a 

favourable order in C.P No.S-518 of 2022 he approached to the executing

court  again,  where  the  impugned  judgment  was  passed  reducing  the 

monthly  installment  of  Rs.20,000/-  to  Rs.15,000/-.  Counsel  states  that 

the essence of the judgment of the trial court dated 05.03.2020and that 

of  the  appellate  court’s  judgment  dated  14.03.2022 was  to  primarily 

retain the dowry articles or in alternate to receive Rs.250,000/-. Against 

which,  two  appeals  were  filed  and  one  constitutional  petition  was 

preferred to the extent that with astronomical increase in price of those 

articles  only  Rs.15,000/- are to be paid by the respondent,  which sums 

are  not  justifiable,  rather  the  petitioner  seeks  that  the  respondent  be 

compelled  to  handover  the  dowry  articles  as  per  the  judgment  of  the 

appellate  court  in  Family  Appeal  No.49  of  2020.  Counsel  states  that  to 

the  best  of  his  knowledge  all  those  dowry  articles  are  still  lying  in  the 

house of the respondent who has contracted second marriage and  he is 

using the said dowry articles.  

Let  notice  be  issued  to  the  respondents  as  well  as  A.G  Sindh  for 

17.04.2024. In the meanwhile, Nazir or his nominee is appointed at the 

cost  of  the  petitioner  being  Rs.10,000/-  to  visit  the  premises  of  the 

respondent,  to  make  out  inventory  of  all  the  articles  present  therein, 

which  are  part  of  the  dowry  articles  subject  matter  of  the  present 

litigation,  take  photographs  thereof  and  present  a  statement  in  the 

Court.  In  the  meanwhile,  operation  of  the  impugned  judgment  dated 

30.10.2023passed in Family Appeal No.71 of 2023 to remain suspended 

till the next date of hearing.
