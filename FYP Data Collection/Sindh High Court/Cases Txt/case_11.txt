------------------------- 

Zulfiqar  Ahmad  Khan,  J:-    This  petition  has  been  moved  against 

consolidated judgment dated 07.05.2022in the Family Appeal No.106 of 

2021 passed by IXth Additional District & Sessions Judge (MCAC) Karachi 

East, where at one point Respondent No.1 moved to Appellate Court for 

reduction of the maintenance provided to the petitioner and where the 

petitioner  moved  for  the  enhancement  of  the  maintenance  for  the 

period of 66 months that the wedding lasted.   

A  review  of  the  Trial  Court’s  judgment  (paragph-7  page  11) 

stipulates that the Trial Court having taken cognizance of the fact that 

the net income of the respondent ex-husband was Rs.235,000/- however 

chose to prescribe maintenance of Rs.20,000/- no methodology has been 

prescribed as to under what formula this meager amount of Rs.20,000/- 

was deduced.  

Counsel for Respondent No.1 is already failed to assist this  Court 

when  husband  was  earning  Rs.235,000/-  why  the  court  granted 

maintenance  of  Rs.20,000/-  in  all  fairness  to  me  this  amount  looks 

extremely  low.  Counsel  states  that  the  respondent  is  still  serving  as 

doctor in the Government of Sindh, where his salary would in more than 

what in the year 2011.

In  the  circumstances,  this  petition  is  allowed  to  the  extent  that 

the  maintenance  of  Rs.20,000/-  prescribed  by  the  Trial  Court’s  order 

lacking  serious  application  of  mind  and  considering  the  welfare  of  the 

petitioner is enhanced to Rs.50,000/- per month with immediate effect 

(with  enhancement  of  usual  10%  annually)  considering  the  fact  that  in 

most  of  the  modern  jurisdictions,  wife  being  a  home-maker  is  given 

equal  portion  of  the  income  of  the  husband  and  the  duties  of  home-

makers are held not to be any less than those of the earning member of 

the  family  (i.e.  husband).  Respondent  No.1  is  accordingly  directed  to 

deposit the sums with the Nazir of this Court within fifteen days. In case 

he fails to pay the maintenance his salary would be attached.  

Let  copy  of  this  order  be  sent  to  the  Secretary  Health, 

Government of Sindh. 

This petition is disposed of in the above terms.
