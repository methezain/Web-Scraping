Mr. Umar Khan, Advocate for the petitioner  

----------------- 

1. 

2. 

Urgency granted. 

Exemption granted subject to all just exceptions. 

3&4.  This  petition  challenges  concurrent  findings  of  the  courts  below, 

where  the  trial  court has  held  that  the  condition  19  of  Nikahnama  was 

enforceable and pronounced that as  admittedly  the  petitioner  divorced 

the  respondent,  she  is  entitled  to  recover  five  Tola  gold  or  its  present 

market  value  and  amount  of  Rs.500,000/-.  Counsel  states  that 

enforceability  of  condition  19  is  shadowed  by  the  judgments  of  the 

Hon’ble Supreme Court and he has placed reliance on PLD 2011  SC 260 

(Syed  Mukhtar  Hussain  Shah  v.  Mst.  Saba  Imtiaz  and  others)  and  2008 

SCMR  186  (Muhammad  Bashir  Ali  Siddiqui  v.  Mst.  Sarwar  Jahan  Begum 

and  another).  However,  the  judgment  PLD  2011  SC  260  pertains  to 

condition 17 and not condition 19 and 2008 SCMR 186 that again was in 

different  circumstances,  where  a  constrain  was  placed  on  the  rights  of 

the  wife  to  seek  separation  by  way  of  Khulla.  Counsel’s  wish  that  the 

petitioner  wants  to  respondent  to  join  him,  cannot  be  granted  through 

constitutional  petition,  Sharia  provides  mechanism  for  doing  it,  if 

petitioner is inclined to do so. With regard to claim that condition 19 of 

the  Nikahnama  is  not  enforceable,  I  do  not  see  anything  on  record  to 

show  or  any  case  law  to  prove  that  such  condition  cannot  be  fulfilled.

CP No.S-543 of 2023 

The  fact  is  that  if  such  condition  was  left  as  blank,  may  be  the 

respondent lady might not have chosen to enter into Nikahnama with the 

petitioner,  therefore,  the  petitioner  who  promised  the  respondent 

through  condition  19  cannot  now  deviate  from  such  undertakings 

dishonestly.  

Petition  being  meritless 

is 

thus  dismissed  with  pending 

applications.
