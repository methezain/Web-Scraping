Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan, J:-  None  has  effected  appearance  on  behalf  of 

Respondent  No.1.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  states  that  the 

trial  Court  without  considering  the  affidavit-in-evidence  submitted  by 

the  petitioner  not  only  decreased  the  value  of  the  dowry  articles  also 

assumed  that  the  jewelry  was  with  the  petitioner,  which  was  not  the 

case.  Counsel  contends  that  gross  illegality  has  been committed by  the 

courts below and requests that both the judgments be set aside and the 

matter be heard de novo. 

In the circumstances, when there are no contrary stance both the 

judgments are set aside and the matter be decided by the trial Court de 

novo.
