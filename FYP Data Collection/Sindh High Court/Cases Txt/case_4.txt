Mr. Mohamed Vawda, Advocate for the petitioner  

-------------------- 

1. 

2. 

Urgency granted. 

Deferred. 

3-5.  Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the visitation rights 

given  to  the  respondent  (father)  were  part  of  the  guardian  and  wards 

application  moved  by  the  father,  where  custody  was  primarily  given  to 

the petitioner (mother) through order dated 26.05.2021, and custody of 

the minor was  directed to be  handed out in the presence of the Bailiff 

on alternate Saturdays between 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon as well as on 

the  second  day  of  Eid  etc.  With  regards  to  the  summer  vacations  10 

days,  and  5  days  in  winter  holidays  were  also  granted.  Counsel  states 

that  the  respondent  father  preferred  appeal  against  that  order  which 

was  dismissed,  however  being  aggrieved  he  preferred  constitutional 

petition  to  this  Court,  which  petition  was  disposed  of  by  order  dated 

01.02.2022 directing  him  to  file  an  application  in  the  Guardian  and 

Wards  Court,  which  resulted  him  in  filing  an  application  accordingly, 

where  the  impugned  order  dated  08.11.2023 has  been  passed,  where 

extended  visitations  have  been  granted  in  toto  without considering  the 

welfare  of  the  minor.  Counsel  states  that  the  impugned  order  suggests 

that  on  every  Saturday  the  minor  would  be  with  the  father  from  10:00 

a.m. to 04:00 p.m and on minor’s birthday custody would be remain with 

the  father  and  even  on  the  father’s  birthday  the  custody  would  also 

remain  with  the  father.  Counsel  states  that  these  extended  visitations 

enjoyed by the father are hampering welfare of the minor, as evidently 

the  Bailiff  report  suggests  that  the  minor  was  taken  to  the  office  to

C.P No.S-607 of 2024 

spend  time  with  the  father.  Not  only  so,  the  counsel  states  that  the 

minor  is  exposed  to  PG-16  movies/videos  and  other  material,  which  is 

causing  serious  disturbance  to  his  mental  health,  certain  sketch  are 

attached  at  pages  183  to  193  to  show  minor’s  trail  of  imagination. 

Counsel  states  that  the  petitioner  mother  filed  complaint  before  the 

concerned court  as  to  how  the  Bailiff  permitted  the  father  to  take  the 

minor  to  his  office  and  except  for  reprimanding  the  Bailiff,  no  further 

relief  yielded.  Counsel  states  that  there  is  danger  that  by  way  of 

extended visitation rights the respondent will take custody of the minor 

in  the  coming  summer  vacations  and  since  he  has  already  shown 

suspicious  behaviour  towards  raising  the  child,  counsel  requests  that 

such  extended  visitation  through  the  impugned  order  be  restricted  to 

the  extent  that  the  respondent  be  eligible  for  alternate  weekends’ 

visitation from 10:00 a.m. to 01:00 p.m. 

Let  notice  be  issued  to  the  respondent  for  27.08.2024.  In  the 

meanwhile,  the  extended  visitation  granted  by  the  impugned  order 

dated 18.11.2023in Guardian and Wards Application No.1366 of 2020 to 

remain suspended till the next date of hearing. The visitation would only 

be  first  and  third  Saturdays  between  10:00  a.m.  to  01:00  p.m.  in  the 

presence  of  the  Bailiff  of  the  concerned  court  however  the  respondent 

shall ensure that he will not take the minor to the office nor expose him 

to  any  PG  material,  which  is  adverse  to  the  interest  of  the  minor  and 

Bailiff to file a report with the concerned court on every Saturday when 

the minor is handed out to the respondent.
