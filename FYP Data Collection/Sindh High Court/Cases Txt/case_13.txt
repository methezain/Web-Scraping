Mr. Irfan Bashir Bhutta, Advocate for the petitioner  

-------------------- 

1. 

2. 

Urgency granted. 

Exemption granted subject to all just exceptions. 

3&4.  Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  mother  states  that  the 

petitioner moved application under Section 7(10) and respondent father 

under  Section  25  of  the  Guardian  and  Wards  Act,  1890,  which  were 

decided  through  consolidated  order  dated  21.02.2024 (page-27),  where 

inter  alia  the  father  was  entitled  to  meet  the  minor  within  the  court 

premises  on  every  1st  and  3rd  Saturday  of  each  calendar  month  from 

11:00  till  02:00.  Counsel  states  that  the  respondent  father  challenged 

the said consolidated order, where by way of interim relief the appellate 

Court  through  order  dated  07.03.2024 after  issuing  notice  to  the 

respondents  has  ordered  parties  to  maintain  status  quo.  Counsel  states 

that while this order is vague in nature and at best could be considered 

that no action contrary to the impugned consolidated order should have 

been  made,  however  thereafter  Bailiff  appeared  at  petitionerâ€™s 

residence  to  collect  the  child.  The  minor  daughter  under  the  age  of 

Hazanat  was  not  handed  out  to  the  Bailiff,  against  which  inaction,  the 

petitioner  fears  coercive  action.  Learned  counsel  states  that  order 

passed  by  the  appellate  Court  is  non-speaking  and  does  not  give  any 

cogent reasons as to why a departure from the order of the trial Court is 

made. Not only so, it is specifically not mentioned that the consolidated 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                       -2-                      C.P No.S-340 of 2024 

order  has  been  suspended  and  the  respondent  father  taking  benefit  of 

such lacuna is forcing the petitioner mother to handover custody of the 

minor  to  the  Bailiff,  so  that  the  minor  be  presented  to  the  respondent 

father,  who  in  fact  does  not  want  to  meet  the  child  in  the  court 

premises.  

Let  notice  be  issued  to  the  respondents  as  well  as  A.G  Sindh  for 

27.03.2024. In the meanwhile, subject to the appellate Court passing a 

detailed  and  speaking  final  order  on  the  application  filed  by  the 

respondent, the visitation rights at page 6 of the consolidated judgment 

dated  21.02.2024 shall  continue  till  the  next  date  of  hearing  i.e  the 

respondent  father  only  to  meet  the  minor  in  the  court  premises  o  the 

given date and time.
